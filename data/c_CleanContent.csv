j7ugo34,I learned about the fundamental difference between rich and working class people long before I experienced homelessness.   I was in an accident about twenty years ago_ and I was in a wheelchair for three or four months. I'd take a bus to physical therapy_ but if the weather was nice_ I'd roll home in my chair. It was about four and a half miles. I lived in a  neighborhood_ but my route took me through an affluent area.  The first time I rolled home_ I got to the end of a block and realized that there wasn't a ramp at the corner. It was a long block_ and rather than go all the way back to the ramp at the other end_ I tried to roll off the curb. I was unsuccessful.  I tipped over and got dumped out of my chair. This happened a block away from a parochial school_ and was right when it was letting out. The intersection was a four-way stop_ and there was a nonstop stream of cars that came to a stop a few feet away_ then proceeded through the intersection. None of them stopped.   I had casts on both legs_ and my broken ribs weren't quite healed yet_ so I was in a lot of pain. I lay there in the gutter for several minutes before I recovered enough to move. It took me another couple of minutes to climb back into the chair. Meanwhile_ the stream of cars continued to roll past.  In my neighborhood_ random people would offer to help me cross the street. There was a block with a very steep hill a few blocks from my house that I chose to go up. I could have gotten to the top by another route that spread the slope out over several blocks_ but I was all about pushing my limits. Pedestrians would often offer to help me get to the top_ and people in cars would frequently pull over and watch to make sure I made it.  I know rich people who have hearts of gold. But many of them (and I think this is more often the case with upper middle class people than with the extremely wealthy) strive to insulate themselves from the gritty reality of how the other half lives.,Rachel_Silver,ZoDAxa66,38,10,3,3,1530

j7vrb35,"The cops were called on me all the time when I parked in a rich suburb. But my job was there so I didn't have much choice. It seemed everyone thought sleeping in your car is illegal_ so they'd dial 911. Number one reason given was that residents were ""scared"" but I was always in a commercial parking lot so idk what the issue was. Typically the cops would just check in to make sure we were okay and went on their way.   When I worked in a much less affluent area_ the only people who called the cops were the ones who were bothered by my dog living in the car with us.  EDIT in the poorer area_ we got a lot of spontaneous help in the form of home cooked meals_ cases of water_ dog food_ and one woman even gave us a bunch of body care products she made herself. That was probably the most touching because she just wanted to help but didn't know how. Her soaps were AMAZING.",SugarHooves,ZoDAxa66,38,3,1,3,1530
j82gztc,Tiburon California in the 1990s would have the police follow and pull over cars that would be normal cars in most places but that were not expensive enough to be in Tiburon. The police were harassing the servants of the wealthy in an effort to make sure the servants were authentic servants rather than poor people coming to see the views.  Tiburon has great views of San Francisco bay but those views are the property of the wealthy and poor people apparently don’t deserve to see nice views.  I was allowed into Tiburon because I was their taxi driver taking the real people to the airport.  The police were allowed in to protect the rich but the police were also not wealthy enough to be one of the real people.  Wealthy Sausalito 5 miles from Tiburon had a different kinder culture from Tiburon but also had great views of the Bay.  Contempt for the common man was common in Tiburon but not common in Sausalito.

I suppose hitchhiking is frowned upon by authorities. It's something I never did because I somehow managed to always have a car even as they were used and cheap.

j7vitcp,Thank you for being transparent. Your feelings are valid. Anyone that goes through that kind of cycle_ repeatedly_ is bound to believe that's how their life will remain. It makes sense to feel anxious about your current living situation and what could possibly happen_ especially_ after you've dealt with homelessness on and off for so long.  But the anxiety can rob you of the joy that you could have  from simply having a place to stay. Although_ we don't know what the future holds but all we can do is hope for the best and live in the NOW. Enjoy what you have now. Don't worry so much about the future_ especially about the things you can't really control. Of course it's okay to take preventative measures to avoid being homeless again but letting that fear rule over your mind can take away the precious time you could spend with yourself (and others) in your place of dwelling. With the economy the way how it is now_ nothing is guaranteed to be stable.  You don't want so much time to pass you by and you never got to enjoy what you have now. It's something that you might regret because you could have created a memorable life experience.  I know your pain. I wish I can help more.  It's a blessing to have a roof over your head.

Feel free to us that exact phrasing... as in ""***Hi.  My name is XXX.  I'd like to inquire as to the status of my application?***""  It has been three months since you applied.  How many times have you contacted them_ and what has been their response?  Your mother says you need to be out_ and one of the reasons she falls back on_ is that you aren't on the lease.  Why not?  In another comment_ you state that you currently have a job_ but that it doesn't pay enough to cover any of the places you could rent that are around you.  Why aren't you paying as much as you can to your mother_ in exchange for her having you on the lease?  I mean_ it is possible_ especially these days_ for landlords to be very strict_ so that they will charge more for additional people living in an apartment.. and I could see the rent increase being more than you could afford_ if everything was made official.  Still... no info as to why you aren't on the lease now.  Another person here asked if you have a car_ and you avoided answering that question.  ***Do you have a car?***  If you do_ is there a reason why you aren't living in it_ or won't consider living in it?  If you do not have a car_ you can likely purchase some beater with even the meager funds you pull in at your current job.  No_ you won't be shopping for the car at any used car lots... nothing that expensive.  You'll be sifting through Craigslist_ walking to all the local welding shops_ and boiler shops_ and bakeries_ etc._ looking for old trucks and delivery vans they would consider selling cheap.  You check the bulletin board in the local library.  You ask at the corner garage_ or at the towing companies_ if they know where you can purchase a car cheap.  You find a local junk yard_ or Pick N Pull lot_ and see if they have any running vehicles they'd sell for next to nothing.  There are options out there for cheap running vehicles.  And that's a house on wheels when you have nothing else.  As to the current arguing... it takes two to argue.  You are 19.  She technically doesn't owe you housing and support anymore_ as you are legally an adult.  So... her house_ her rules.  I'm not saying she isn't the kind of person to find a reason to argue about anything.  I'm just saying it isn't an argument_ if she is yelling and you are just standing there not responding.  You wouldn't ***call*** that an argument either.  >my mom is just doing it as a way to get rid of me because she doesn't want to deal with me  You are 19.  She shouldn't have to ever ""deal"" with you ever again.  You and she are both adults.  If she doesn't want to have to have an experience with another adult where she considers it ""dealing with someone""_ she doesn't have to.  It is one of the perks of being an adult.  That_ and ""dealing"" with the consequences of one's actions and decisions.  Having to ""deal with someone"" is generally a bad and stressful experience.  If you were problematic as a child_ whether she created the monster you were_ or you did that on your own... she legally had to ""deal"" with you because you were her CHILD.  You aren't a child anymore... well_ your body isn't a child anymore.  So if she is pushing for you to join JobCorps_ because living with you is only stress and anger to her... that's completely within her rights.  As bad as that makes you feel_ you cannot change her.  You can only change yourself.  You are equally responsible for your relationship with your mother.  People work jobs they hate_ to support families they love.  You probably could have played the part of a loving daughter (aka_ treated it like a job)_ at least to keep the peace in the home.  I say it like that_ because... again... I'm not discounting the possibility of your mother being impossible to please.  But if you...  *  have a job_ and you  * pay her money towards your rent_ and you * pay for your own meals (and occasionally cook for her)_ and you * clean up the place like you are the maid_ and you * don't have guests over_ or hold parties_ and you * regularly ask her what she needs or wants and promptly fill those requests with priority  ... I can't see her wanting to kick you out.  I can see that as a borderline abusive relationship_ if not an actual abusive relationship... but I can also see it as a way to maintain a status quo_ for you.  Basically going Gray Rock to a Narcissist_ since No Contact isn't feasible for the situation.  You obviously wanted out and away from living under her rules once before.  In the time that you lived with relatives_ how did you change yourself to fix the issues between you and your mother?  I mean... if you didn't do anything to make progress in ""improving""_ at least by your mother's standards_ in the time you were away... you had no reasonable expectation of there being less friction when you moved back.  All this plays a part moving forward.  You have to go... and you have no real ties (from everything you describe) to where you are.  So... go mobile.  Get away from the unhelpful family.  Obtain a vehicle_ and drive to a seasonal tourist town.  Why?  You are 19_ and female.  Tourist towns see a swell in residence and work while they are ""in season""... and then the people and work dry up during the ""off season"".  In Season_ many of these employers offer pay AND housing_ in exchange for you being on call or working long schedules.  These are jobs like... selling T-shirts and towels_ or selling/renting Ski gear_ waitressing_ bar tending/backing_ working a counter at a deli/bakery/motel_ cleaning motel rooms_ etc.  You could summer on Cape Cod (Massachusetts)_ and Winter in Key West (Florida)... making that long drive twice a year_ when the local In Season end.  **Chincoteague_ VA is only a stone's throw away on the coast_ and that's Seasonal Tourist_ with fuzzy ponies.**  The point there_ is that being 19 and female_ you have the greatest chance of walking into ANY of the jobs in these towns.  You fit the profile of what they want between their registers and the tourist's money.  College age girls make up the bulk of the seasonal employees in Provincetown_ MA... be it at galleries_ bars_ shops_ restaurants_ etc.    There's migrant work.  Use your youth_ and go pick vegetables for a month and earn $3000 or more.  Where I am in Imperial County_ California_ we have a year-long grow season.  There are crops all year long_ and there is always a need to pick something.  Get a car_ travel the country_ go work hard for a few months or a year_ and get the cash you feel you need to straighten yourself out.  $5000 for a month and a half picking Sugar Beets in Montana or South Dakota... get paid for camping_ working out_ and meeting cool people.",bongart,Medical_Price8780,11,6,1,8,1024

I know in Canada at the very least it's illegal to discriminate based on familial status (which a child counts as_ unsurprisingly)_ and i do seem to recall the US having a similar law.   Other countries i cannot speak to at all.   Either way_  anyone who kicks someone out for having a child is so far below garbage it's poisoning the groundwater.

j7sllzw,If the government got out of the way_ non profits and even just individuals and homeless people themselves could build housing for every one.   I have a backyard and would be happy to have  one or two shed-shelters in it where people can have a bed to sleep warm and a place to lock their belongings so they can build their lives back.  If the government wouldn't call that illegal I could partner with a non-profit to build and manage those_ or just do it myself_ or even let a homeless individual do it themselves starting with a tent and upgrading it to a cabin in time.   But the government will shut it down right now.     Similarly non-profits would build SRO's I'd they were allowed but they can't.    So the line that it's not tax payers responsibility to build shelter for folks who can't pay for it is a red herring_ we have more than enough non-profit money to build the shelters but a government mostly driven by NIMBYS who make it illegal to do so.,PurpleDancer,RabidusRex,230,9,1,3,1530

You really need to control the individual until they are able to be functioning otherwise all you have is someone who may hurt those around him.

j7o2qy1,If you get desperate you can check into a psych hospital. You just say that you are having suicidal thoughts with a plan and intent. Once you are admitted you are stucknfor about a week but if you get in a hospital with good socialnworkers they will get you set up with med-ical state insurance and hopefully into a sober living (these arent neccessarily for drug addicts_ just homes where drugs are not allowed and everyone is expected to be looking for work or working),HowDidIFallForThis,rustydoggg,64,2,1,8,1024
j85b757,1) Do not admit to DSHS that you have any money at all. Take it out of the bank. Put it in your pocket or someplace safe. Any money that you have they will deny you getting GR or even CalFresh. They will want a copy of your bank account. So pull out the cash immediately and then don't use it for at least a month and then apply for GR or CalFresh if you can hold off that long. If you can't_ take the money out and then don't admit that you have a checking account_ they will ask you how you been managing your money though. So the first way really is the best way. Leave $2 in the account just to keep it open.  2) If you get into a shelter_ do not admit that you are going into a shelter because they will cut down your GR to less than $100.   3) Use every organization resource in your area. Ask for help in whatever way they can offer it and follow-up. The people who follow up and show that they're serious about getting rehoused and getting a new job will get job assistance and housing assistance as well as medical.,Antique_Radish8823,rustydoggg,64,2,1,3,1530

j7pk15v,Wow... A lot of answers are great but first you need to assess the situation and your assets. Who can you call for help? Have you called 311(if they have that in America...)? Do any friends have a sleeping bag_ or a couch to sleep on? Are you wearing the proper amount of clothing for the season/environment? These are the first steps.  So with that it's a fork in the road. You either have a friend or a shelter providing a place to sleep and hang out_ or you're still on your own. If someone is there to help_ congrats. Maybe throw a couple bucks their way or donate a couple to the shelter helping. It's always good to contribute when homeless or not because it sticks with your soul.  If you didn't get help that's ok. You will need a sleeping bag_ a sleeping mat_ a reusable water bottle_ a backpack to carry it all_ and a location to sleep. If you don't know a secure and private place to sleep or hang out I would suggest looking for one next. A good idea is to find a spot and keep revisiting throughout the day to get a feel of what people or animals will be coming and going in the area. Cardboard makes good insulation and reflects body heat back to you and is great resistance to the coldness.  I think that's all you are looking for.

You want to get a mosquito net that's entirely separate from the hammock and wraps around it.  They're a little more expensive but less hassle in the long run.  I would advise against getting a hammock with mosquito net sewn on to it. Those things are usually tiny and the mosquitoes can still bite you through the bottom of the fabric. But those are the cheapest setups so it wouldn't hurt to try it out at first. Use a sleeping pad to keep the mosquitoes off your back and butt.    You'll need a foam sleeping pad on cool nights to stop your body heat from escaping through the bottom of the hammock. They're about $3 to $20 at Walmart.  Hold on...,Oviris,JayStrat,13,2,2,3,1530

As you have a little time to assess resources nearest you this is the time to talk to United Way's 2-1-1 or [211.org](https://211.org) website and see what other public and private organizations can help you. 2-1-1 will help localize those resources for you. 3. You may be able to get some temporary rental assistance_ if needed_ from private organizations with some listings at [https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental\_assistance\_near\_you.html](https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental_assistance_near_you.html). 4. Plan on getting assistance from Orange County by asking about being signed up for discounted bus fare through the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). OCTA website with bus routes: [https://www.octa.net/Bus/Routes-and-Schedules/Overview/](https://www.octa.net/Bus/Routes-and-Schedules/Overview/). If you sign up with a temp agency you can ask if they offer bus discounts like the Perk Pass. [https://www.octa.net/Bus/Fares-and-Passes/Specialty-Passes/Perk-Pass/](https://www.octa.net/Bus/Fares-and-Passes/Specialty-Passes/Perk-Pass/). 5. Make self-help plan to sign up with as many temporary job agencies as reasonable as it can be for you. See the comprehensive guide for suggestions. 6. Recommendation for a ""starter"" tent is to have a popup tent so as to not not have to deal with the hassle or extra weight of pegs no matter what surface it is placed on. Also make sure there is a tarp underneath the tent and one placed on top. This is to help make sure the tent is not torn on ground debris and as an extra layer against wind and rain.

It's woefully ignorant of you to assume that the reason I am homeless is because I am an addict.   I am not. What I am is chronically ill and unfortunately very much disabled and while that is not your business I am telling you that so you will get a clue and not just assume that everybody who is homeless is homeless because they are addicted to alcohol or drugs. While it is true a certain percentage of homeless people are addicts many of us are not. We're not all mentally ill to the point of it being dangerous either.   If you really want to know why people are ASK them because the real answers they may just surprise you. Most people that end up homeless are not addicted or harmfully mentally ill at all.

I think people want to believe we are all addicts because (and this isn’t fair to addicts either or how addiction works) that’s something they can blame the homeless person for. It’s not too different from how often people love to ask if I was born with my disabilities- they want to believe they’re safe and it couldn’t happen to them. But it can (and frankly so can addiction_ obviously).   Then there’s the folks- the same ones who insist there must magically be all this support for disabled people_ that oh “just get on section 8” like it’s that easy. It’s all people not wanting to face the reality of it all_ how frankly cruel the world can be_ how many of us end up in really bad situations through no fault of our own. It’s easier to carry on with life if you think everyone homeless is there because of a mistake they made or by choice. If you believe all illnesses magically have cures.

Nobody really wanted to help me except my gf (now wife). I used to be way more likely to lend a helping hand. But I remember how people judged me and how nobody wanted to help me_ save for a very small handful of rare times where someone would maybe let me take a shower at their house_ or a time I remember a friend gave me 40 bucks - I think that was the only time that ever happened.   I pretty much dug myself out with almost no help_ I live in a state with no Medicaid expansion. I got on methadone_ and I had to pay $14 a day for it even when I couldn't afford food. No money meant no dose. There was no empathy even when I tried to help myself.  I fear becoming homeless again all the time_ and the scary thing is if it happens again it's not going to be because of drugs. But I am way less likely to help others now_ I don't owe anybody anything (unless the friend who gave me that $40 needed help). All I ever heard while I was struggling was that nobody owed me a damn thing. Fine.   I hate it_ I wish I still believed in a world where people would help me if I was in trouble and I wanted to help them too. I still find myself with the urge to help sometimes_ but I talk myself out of it. No good deed goes unpunished. There was even a time I fell for someones sob story on a similar subreddit_ they claimed they had an abscess and needed medication. It was a scam.   The silver lining of everyone treating me like garbage is that I don't owe nobody shit. If I'm such a piece of garbage junkie_ they shouldn't be asking me for anything anyway.,Suckmyflats,Equivalent-Earth9921,57,0,1,8,1024

j7kjqll,Also_ google mug meals or single serving meals/cooking for one. If you have the funds or can ask online_ a toaster oven would do for simple baking.  A mini crockpot or hotpot is great too.  With those two small appliances your cooking can take on a whole new life.  Amazon takes EBT and can deliver nonperishable food right to you. With a mini fridge I would take food out of its packaging_ chop veggies small and put it in baggies_ flatten them down as best you can and stack up.  A lot of space is wasted in the packaging.  You can buy six eggs at a time_ rather than a dozen.  Apples_ bananas_ oranges_ grapes_ tomatoes_ potatoes_ carrots and others just need a cool place for a few days_ not a fridge.  Just buy what you will eat in 3-4 days_ eating the foods that go off fastest first_ like grapes or bananas.  Plan your meals and buy exactly what you need.  Powdered milk in a shaker cup of water takes little space even in a mini fridge_ and can be used for cereal_ in coffee or for cooking.

j7lzwn7,"I used to when I was homeless. Most of what I got was really bad shelter food or fast food when I was on the streets. It gets real old after a while. I literally got stuff from trash bags that was thrown out and still wrapped up in plastic from this one coffee place and sanitized the bags just so I could convince myself to eat it.  It was real FOOD_ you know? I could not actually dumpster dive. It was just revolting to me thinking of doing that but otherwise I got food wherever I could.  I used to dream about eating steak and mashed potatoes a lot. I practically lived on chips or breakfast bars some days. I'd go to a local food pantry for a hot meal when I was really broke only to find that whatever they made that day had something toxic in it and I couldn't eat it. Broccoli in particular it was just the bane of my existence some days because a lot of places that serve real food think that it's so nutritious and they mix it into everything. I'm actually so allergic that if it touches other food and I eat it I'm in trouble so I'd just have to leave with a roll or whatever and that would be it that day.  I almost liked being on the street better than being in the shelter because at least the food was edible and I knew where to scounge it. I hardly ever went hungry even money-less on the streets. In the shelter I pretty much starved regularly. I'm really not great at that. Food insecurity is really hard for me because there was a lot of that when I was a kid. If I don't have at least a week's worth of groceries on hand I can feel very anxious.  I have diabetes and fasting is a lot harder for me than it used to be. I find I have to eat at least a protein heavy snack every few hours or I just get sick_ like nauseated sick. If I was on the streets or in a shelter now I'd be very hard up because it's been getting harder to keep my blood sugar at all stable and if I ate now like I was eating then it would not be cool.  I spend a good chunk of my income past rent and that on food and that despite the EBT. The probably upcoming loss of a lot of EBT funds is going to hit me hard and the food pantries around me are not going to be much help. I'm going to be eating less and eating a lot of stuff I shouldn't just to eat.  That's life of late. I mean it is what it is_ but in some ways being street homeless was better in terms of me eating regularly enough. That's sad when you think about it but that's just how not useful the food pantries have been of late. I really need to keep those EBT funds but it looks like it's ""Good luck with that!""  Yesterday one of the women in my building told me very solemnly that she plans on selling her diabetic test strips because she can get extra $$$ monthly doing that. That's real healthy that_ sacrificing not checking your blood sugar just to buy more food_ but I totally get it. They decreased her EBT from $281 to $23. What else is she going to do but find some way to make some other money? She can't work a job_ like me she's too disabled_ so obviously she's going to end up selling whatever she can. No more OTC meds either.  That's the reality of what they are doing by cutting the EBT for millions of older_ disabled people_ for the homeless_ for everyone truly low income sans kids. They know that but they don't really care. I guess we're just redundant these days...",mtempissmith,veryberryblue,25,2,1,9,1231

Ask the individual_ tell them why you want to give them the book_ make it personal and kind and not just cleaning out the closet and it could mean a lot to someone. Chances are_ it will become trash. But I'm pretty sure that a library will take in books if they are in the right condition_ so maybe suggest that_ especially if they already go to the library.

Any time I spend reading now is on here & kids books to him lol.   But I had so many homies that were homeless that read to pass the time. Have heard a lot of ppl say it distracted them from their sometimes uncomfortable/unfavorable living conditions.  They traded books and told each other titles to 'keey an eye out for. Always thought that was cool. I love those little ""Community Libraries"" - like the ones where ppl leave books on like a take one/ leave one sorta basis. It always makes me SO mad when I walk by and they're destroyed or littered with trash. I usually try to pick up a little if I find one like that.  Side note —I hate how the homeless get blamed for shit like that but every homeless homie of mine who frequented them (and every homeless person I've ever seen at one in general) has always been so respectful!    If your town/city doesn't have those & you have the means at all I would try to start one!

j7oxtaf,My time being homeless started after I fucked up and misread the schedule on when I was supposed to work_ and noone could get in contact with me because my phone didn't have service. With the company I work for_ it's three no-call no-shows before you're terminated.  The guy that had the shift before meessed up and called the district manager_ and not the store manager.  For roughly about half of the year and a month I was homeless I lived in one of two shelters_ one Salvation Army_ and one that doesn't exist in a 'chain' (single location).   The other half I lived outdoors. For a while it was under a bridge near a creek_ and another lady slept there too. On Saturdays there would be a church service there_ so I had to wake up a bit earlier than normal so I could pack my things and set them aside so chairs could be set out. I'm not what some people may call s Christian_ but I kinda miss those services.  After my 'roommate' checked into a shelter_ I moved everything of mine to a more public and visible place across the street from the library. That way if a guy came by and wanted to do things and wouldn't take no for an answer_ I was closer to a place I could go for help.  Though that was in Texas_ and I was breaking one of the anti-homeless laws. I was ok for a few weeks_ but one day I was leaving the library to go eat lunch_ and three police officers cornered me (well_ sorta?) And one asked me if my name was such and such. He said that I needed to move my things or they would be tossed in the trash in what I remember as an annoyed/angry sort of tone_ and him nearly touching my back with his chest as he and the two other officers went with me to my 'spot'. I kept my cool_ said yes sir/no sir_ and cleaned my spot like they said to. I'm not sure if me doing that made a difference_ but one of the officers called the Salvation Army on the Arkansas side of town_ and offered to take me and my things to the health clinic for a covid test_ and I walked the short distance to the SA shelter.  Then maybe around the last week of December_y former boss told my mom to tell me to reapply to the store I worked at_ and when the 1st day of 2022 rolled around_ I wasn't homeless anymore. Stayed withy aunt for two or three weeks until I could get an apartment of my own- those first three weeks or so I was making bank in overtime.   The time I spent in the not SA shelter_ I got a diagnosis of major depression and general anxiety_ but without access to transportation most of the time_ I couldn't go back for refills on my meds when they.ran out.,Oragami,MaintenanceOk4886,8,1,1,3,1530

j87oqm6,"Eh. Not homeless myself_ but I've slept a couple nights in the car in Calgary and spent more then one night on occasion sleeping in the University of Calgary and it seems ok I guess. Can't really see where'd you'd go if its winter out though. Train stations are regularly swept through here due to the amount of addicts smoking in them and unless you're clean most places seem to afford enough security to kick you out of them. Also not a lot of nice spots around here from what I've seen_ cause a lot of the construction here is newer.     Though I can't say the people here treat the homeless as particularly bad either_ mainly because I don't think most people see it as a massive problem in Calgary compared to other major cities. Most of the homelessness is restricted to the C-train lines and therefor your only really walking past them during the part of the day your commuting. Kind of a - not bothering me yet so I'm not going to worry about it yet- kind of mentality_ where we're just glad we're not Vancouver yet_ and thus don't really bother the homeless_ nor try to improve it. Seems we've adopted a motto of ""Just be clean shaven"" around here and ask you to not be strung out on Fentanyl in public_ and so long as you can do that no one will bother you.

j7fkwfi,I lived on the street for 13 years and One thing I'll say_ that I wish I'd had learned earlier on that I try to pass on to people now in regards to sleeping bags...especially in cold weather like this.. is when you look for a good sleeping bag...make sure you find the COMFORT rating and not just the survival rating. Like most of the cheap bags you'll see at places like Walmart that will have the rating shown_ usually 40-50⁰ or whatever...that generally the survival rating...NOT comfort rating. By that I mean even if you find a bag that's survival rates at 30⁰ it doesn't mean you'll be comfortable or even completely warm..it just mean it will keep you alive. If you can afford it_ I have the Stansport Flannel sleeping bag comfort rated to 0⁰ and that thing cooks me_ and I've slept in it down to the lower teens and not felt a thing with just sleeping in my long johns (also another good thing to buy). Paid about $80 on Amazon for it_ well worth the money..though it is a tad heavy at 5 pounds.  Good luck out there OP,lightsaber_lobotomy,veryberryblue,17,2,1,3,1530
j7emrgk,Get a jackery and a heating pad. This will keep you warm at night lol. Jackery can be bought at harbor freight and it holds a good charge for a long time. Just keep it safe and dry. or If you have money get a heated vest_ keeping it bowered usually comes with a brand power pack so it might not last as long tho.   Have a small hygean bag. Mine has nail clippers_ man scape buzzer for cutting hair. Some siccors and stuff. Keep your tooth brush in its own thing so it doesn't get dirty. I use one of those sealed coffee mug for my tooth brush and toothpaste. I can carry it anywhere and people won't think much of it.. you may also need a hammer_ utility blade_ you need to keep your feet dry no matter what so extra socks in a dry bag. A small pocket mirror. Some good mechanic  tweezers. I have a set of 6 that are different shapes for different things.

j7i6rdf,Free sign is a solid idea. Saw it a lot living in a major city. I know_ no matter how needy I am_ if I see a random jacket or something in the park I tend to assume it belongs to someone and I’m not going to touch it. And you sometimes get the type of folks who will take things to a lost and found or post in neighborhood groups about finding an item.   I’d also toss out looking to see if you’ve got a community pantry or fridge type thing around. Or even one of those Little Free Libraries (I used to help care for one that would sometimes get food items and sanitary products) but be mindful they do often have rules and not all will take clothing items but those are heavily utilized by folks in need.,Tzipity,Puzzleheaded-Type298,9,1,1,3,1530

j7epy3x,Things have changed a lot…finally got around to visiting back where I lived during my college years.  Used to_ seemed like most everyone kind of knew to just put things close by a dumpster or in certain areas.  Now with how much the market has changed everything_ laws have been put in place to further punish_ harm_ and prevent those in our society who are in the most need of support in getting it.  I saw this has all changed.  It’s as if the area has carted off anyone suspected of being homeless.  Plenty of the usual over privileged in the area though and broken glass everywhere still.,missfire23,Puzzleheaded-Type298,9,3,1,3,1530

I use google maps on satellite view and zoom in to find a spot with trees and bushes I can hide in.   I'm also willing to go to spots that other people won't. I stayed in an old staging area for road construction in Savanah_  GA. There was a locked gate with bushes on either side where I could just walk around the side of the gates.   Never let anyone see you come in or out. I never take anyone back to camp_ and I never tell anyone where I'm camped. If they ask I just lie and vaguely say 'I'm up over that way a long way out_' and point in a direction away from camp.,CarlHungus2,nikthebeatnik1,42,13,2,8,1024
j7e0ted,I was going to reply to the OP that being as comfortable as possible is a big factor for being happy. A premium spot goes a long way towards that.    In South Florida it will be miserably hot at night 9 months of the year. So not only does my spot have to be safe and dry; it has to have electricity. Having a fan makes a world of difference. Keeps you comfortable and keeps the mosquitoes away. The electricity doesn't have to come from an electrical outlet. You can buy a converter from Home Depot.

I guess y'all could always try to find another headquarters to group up at. I don't know, like I've been trying to work on a project to help but I know sometimes being homeless is a culture of it's own too. It's sad that the city is changing for you, it's hard to say who is right here because for one being homeless causes some filth on the streets and garbage and then also sometimes those places are the most comfortable spots to be in. The benches were usually there for pedestrians and older people who have trouble getting around, they weren't intended to be slept on. I wish instead of changing things to be discouraging they would actually work to help you out. I am trying to see what I can do but it's really hard for a lot of people right now, and I don't have a lot of resources but I've offered my home to a few people that never made it here because they decided to do something else.

j78ndiw,In the confessions of a North Korean defector_ he stated that he was happier in North Korea because he knew all of his neighbors_ rather than the daily grind of chasing after the vanity like they did in the South. Of course_ they were also less likely to say things freely around one another for fear of getting reported.  Neighborhoods typically aren't designed around bench tables for people to come out and share bread. Well_ unless you're homeless.

j7cg3l5,Everyone talks about the idea of women bullying transwomen in the shelters but nobody talks about transwomen bullying women in the shelters because it doesn’t want to cross their mind that this happens. Between late November last year and January that’s exactly what happened in my shelter room with two different people. Not to mention hogging the bathroom for hours that has to be shared by 10 people in the room to “tuck their penis”. It begs the question of why someone with a penis should be given more rights in a women’s shelter. Not to mention threatening to beat people up and mace people twice in the same day right in front of the administration. Not to mention the racism by the second one_ 3 weeks ago_ toward an Asian room member who was called an ugly Chinese bitch everyday (but if she said “you’re not really a woman” that’s discrimination huh) all because she told them not to smoke in the bathroom which is against the laws of the city. Despite them literally threatening to get a friend to come to the shelter and beat her up or kill her the next day. I recorded that on video and what did the front office do? Nothing but coddle. But people draw the line when an elderly_ disabled woman accidentally says “he”.   There are other transwomen here who have no issues with anybody because they’re kind_ not violent and malicious toward people.,No-Baker-9919,Charleswind234,5,5,1,3,1530
j791qid,Your looking more and more like the opposite gender but not exactly being the one you were born can lead to some serious bullying and potential violence. It's cruel if you ask me but they think they are doing it to protect you. Trans people are the subject of a lot of violence in and out of shelters but it can be bad in them.   We had two trans male to female people and one who was transitioning to male in my women's shelter which was for people with mental issues_ addiction issues_ and physical disability. All 3 of them went through absolute hell because the women in the shelter did not accept them and bullied them_ even beat on them trying to get them out of the shelter. It was a constant fight especially when it came to sharing bathrooms.   In a perfect world you would be able to be wherever you felt the most comfortable but we don't live in a perfect world and though their way is wrong headed it's just how it is in a lot of places for now.   I was amazed that they even allowed the folks with male genitals in at all honestly. But either way it did not go well and all of these Trans people ended up really enduring a lot of abuse all round.

j7a799a,I think the way Homeless shelters are modeled and run overall needs to be reformed and updated. I think there would be less need to segregate if the conditions were better within the shelter. Like more space for more rooms and bigger buildings with additional floors that maybe could be could be segregated that way. Everyone should have a safe_ clean place to go. While there does need to be shelters specifically for women and children  just because of higher risk and those who are fleeing domestic abuse situations. The focus doesn't always need to be on that and I can see how that ends up happening. Moving forward when creating new shelters the focus should be on providing clean_ safe spaces for all who need it and their pets.      There is a great new shelter that just opened up here in my county they accept anyone regardless of gender and pets! It's run by a Anti-poverty Fellow at a local university who has been an amazing advocate for the homeless over the years. She treats people with respect and dignity and understands there is more to helping people then just providing a space to sleep or eat. Which is why the shelter is also going to have a floor that provides wrap around services to help people with whatever they need whether it be health/mental health services_ helping people get benefits and/or job programs etc... she also partnered up with some of the businesses in the community to come in and provide free services like haircuts from a local barber. She's pretty much removed any barrier she legally could to allow as many people possible to have access.      Which brings me to another major issue. The barriers to even accessing shelter for anyone are ridiculous and far too difficult.  Here in my county all of the shelters are gatekept by the non profit organization the county made responsible for handling our CoC. No one can access anything without going through them first and they have a habit of regularly turning people away. You have to basically fight to get any help and that's when you DO qualify for help. Anyone on drugs (even marijuana) or who has a criminal record ( no matter how minor or old the offense) automatically doesn't.  Unfortunately the need for shelter is great here so all the shelters remain full on a regular basis. When this happens they will pay for you to stay in a motel but only for a limited amount of time_ 2 weeks. Then they will literally say fuck you you're SOL. It happened when I was homeless not only did I have to fight to even get any help for a month after being turned away the first time.

j7a8hd7,That's also how it's done in my city. The women's shelter is at a secret location and women get picked up to be taken there.   The men's shelter has a day services building next to it for men_ women and families. Anyone can walk in off the street for showers_ laundry_ medical care_ internet and free coffee. Or just take advantage of the heat/air conoitioning.    There's a cafeteria in the back of the day services building. The men's shelter uses it on the weekdays but they have massive feasts on the weekends for everyone. Lot of good food served by various businesses. Sometimes a corporation or charity comes to the weekend feasts to hand out grab bags.  Downside:  The day services facility is always overcrowded. Long lines for showers_ laundry or medical care. You gotta get there first thing in the morning to even make it on the wait list. Then you wait for hours with no guarantee of services.  It's normally predominantly men with about 3 or 4 women on the week days. But you'll see dozen's of women there on the weekend for the feast. There are family rooms but I've seen more famlies in the surrounding wooded areas than at the center. I've never seen the family rooms used.

Florida_ like Texas_ has no medicaid expansion.

I was there for 2 months with my sister until her blood flow issues forced us to get motels for our safety.  Long term survival tips: Get food stamps and hopefully cash aid. Go to food banks in addition to that. Get vitamin gummies and drink a fuck ton of water to stay healthy. Do delivery jobs to make extra money to survive. Sign up for DoorDash and UberEats. Donate plasma for extra money. Look up odd jobs on Craigslist for money. Craigslist also has rooms for rent. Transition to a sales job where there’s less to no cap on what you make (solar_ insurance industry_ etc.) if possible. Or whichever industry you can do some type of independent contracting to avoid a set wage limit. If you don’t have one already eventually get a storage unit for your important belongings If you need a laptop for work you can finance one through Best Buy. Mine’s 30 a month. Look up Volunteers Of America for the best resources near you. We were calling 211 almost everyday until we found stable resources through VOA.

j76kbnb,Two of the biggest mistakes I've learned that people make when confronted with homelessness are 1) being too embarrassed to ask for help and feeling like you're somehow a burden on others_ and 2) choosing to be homeless because of №1 and thinking it'll be very much a temporary situation. There's a reason why all the old religions talk about pride being a bad thing.  If you have friends and/or family around_ cast aside your pride_ come clean_ and ask for help. That's what friends and family are for_ just don't abuse it.  Shit_ even if it's just using their address on job applications and using the shower and WiFi every other day that's a huge advantage towards getting back on your feet. Let *them* decide how much help they're willing to give_ and take it. Pay it back later. If they offer a couch or a room_ take it_ and put effort into cooking_ cleaning_ and making minor repairs if you know how which will show them appreciation and that you aren't trying to get a free ride.  Good luck out there.,BoneHugsHominy,Life_is_an_MLM,58,9,1,3,1530

Don’t tell anyone initially that u live in your car. Church people are just more likely to want to help u get connected with possible place but the key is to gain trust of the decent pple in the community.

j774rd9,"> I often go without a good night's sleep because I'm always worried about being caught.  I called it the 3AM Knock.  I dreaded it.  That fear did_ however_ drive me to do two things.  First_ it made me dig as deeply as I could into exactly where people \*are\* allowed to park overnight... and how I could exploit that.  Two... it eventually made me drive to where I am now.  If you are still worried about being discovered... start looking at the Park N Ride system in your state/county/area.  If the metro area where you are isn't that big_ you may have to expand your range to find active Park N Ride lots.  In most states these facilities are the responsibility of the state Department of Transportation... which means that they are monitored/patrolled by the State Police_ as opposed to the local cops in the cities/towns where the parking lots are actually located.  State Police have a slightly different... view... on minor crimes.  Usually.  At any rate_ there are specific rules for that state's Parn N Ride system_ and there are also rules that are specific to each parking lot_ and they have to be posted AT that parking lot.  Let me put some concrete down here.  From September 2017 until September 2018_ I lived in a Park N Ride lot_ on the line between Lacey and Olympia_ in Washington state.  The lot at Exit 109.  The rules of the lot were simple.  No vehicle could be left unattended for more than 48 hours.  The lot wasn't responsible for belongings left in vehicles_ or vehicles left in the lot.  According to two of the State Troopers who would patrol the lot every Sunday_ living in a vehicle legally constituted attending to a vehicle.  So I was actually living in my vehicle_ in a lot where I had State Police \*Protection\*_ if not tacit approval of the fact that I was living in that lot.  And I wasn't alone_ either.  Others lived in their vehicles_ in that lot.  Now_ it was kind of a Perfect Storm_ of sorts.  The Park N Ride lot I was in_ and the others where people could live indefinitely_ were all close to a highway.  The fact that the lots allowed overnight parking_ was to provide travelers with a safe alternative to falling asleep at the wheel_ on a highway system without rest stops.  This being Washington state_ there are generally a lot of vacationers driving their RVs and Trailers up and down the western corridor between Oregon and Seattle.  So_ there was already a system in place_ and it had been for decades_ to provide safe spots to pull off and sleep for the night before moving on.  Around Seattle_ and the 5 cities basically touching Seattle_ there is no sleeping in a vehicle of any kind allowed_ except in specifically designated areas (this was until 2018).  Not the Walmart... all the Parn N Ride lots have specific restrictions against sleeping in a vehicle_ etc.  Head south_ and pre-2018_ you could have slept in a PnR lot in Tacoma_ 20 minutes away.  Now_ with that [state Supreme Court ruling in 2018](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/judge-rules-seattle-homeless-mans-truck-is-a-home/)_ designating a Washington registered vehicle to be a person's home under the state's Homesteading Act_ there are RVs_ Trailers_ Trucks_ and cars parked all over the place in Olympia_ Lacey_ Aberdeen_ etc. with people living in them_ without fear of that 3AM knock.  So.  Start looking.  Some places won't have much_ if any organized overnight parking.  You may have to shift your range 50-100 miles or so.  There are always loopholes somewhere though.  Where around you_ are people expected to sleep off a long drive?  Where can truckers go when they have to stop driving?  I'm not saying that you should park between rigs... but_ there may be a smaller vehicle lot nearby.  Is there a local Park N Ride system attached to the transit system in your area?  Bus transfer stops_ train stations_ etc.  Parking garages without specific restrictions against sleeping in vehicles can be nice and protected against the weather.  Find the highways_ and find the rest stops.  Look for the PnR lots near highways.  Some beach parking lots absolve themselves of all legal responsibilities after a certain time.  Look for industrial areas that have third shifts.  You may be able to blend in with street parking in those areas_ where your vehicle looks like just another worker's vehicle parked for their shift.  Remember.  Any place that allows for organized overnight parking like that... PnR lots_ Airports_ Bus Stations_ Train Stations_ etc... they not only have rules for their lots_ but they HAVE to post them as per federal and state guidelines.  So if the sign at the lot does NOT specifically restrict you from sleeping in a vehicle... you can sleep in the vehicle.  If the sign ONLY says ""No Overnight Parking""... you cannot get in trouble for sleeping in the vehicle during the day.",bongart,Life_is_an_MLM,58,7,1,8,1024

I used a shovel to dig a bathroom hole. Wetwipes were essential for wiping my face hands and body down_ and I took my trash/waste to work with me every morning.   I used a bicycle to travel and kept tubes and puncture repear kits on hand as well as a pump. I made sure I had a couple of refill water bottles always. I used a powerbank for my phone charging and made sure both were charged before leaving work.   I kept a wet bag type thing for surfing... Used that to store my clean clothes and another one for dirty clothes. Mostly underwear because I wore my work uniform daily. I used a launderette/laundromat weekly to wash my clothes and sometimes went to the gym to shower when necessary. I wore thermal under garments made of wool which I bought discount at go outdoors shop. Which helped keep me warm.  I ate nuts_ sandwiches and things I could buy fresh from the store. I brushed my teeth every day keeping everything in a backpack.  I left my hammock set up every day where it was as I wasn't worried about it being found. But I did also leave a note inside explaining I was homeless and please don't destroy my stuff.  I did this for five months and had a kick ass beard at the end. I learned a lot about knots_ myself_ reliance and also a bit about the ignorance of others. Nobody knew what I was going through and I managed to keep the entire thing secret.  I called it ""tactical homelessness""_ I read books about stoicism and managed to get out of debt_ eventually it became a game... How much money could I save. How minimalist could I be. I felt invincible.",WhistlepigUK,gizmo2077,8,6,1,3,1530

j764vkh,I decided that being able to have a hot meal (that wasn't prepared in a dirty microwave at a gas station) was necessary to stave off despair. I made canned soup a staple in my diet. It's cheap and nutritious_ and it's easy to prepare.   I bought a cheap mess kit with a cooking pot big enough to hold a can of soup. I made an [alcohol stove](https://youtu.be/Mg91VsButWE) and bought some 91% isopropyl alcohol (a.k.a. rubbing alcohol) to fuel it. I used cotton gauze (which I was able to get for free) instead of fiberglass inside the stove_ and it worked well enough_ although I have to replace it periodically.   I used an empty Progresso can (they're wider than typical soup cans) to make a wind shield for the stove. It also holds the pot over the stove while cooking. I removed the bottom and used the awl on my Swiss army knife to make a bunch of holes in the sides of the can spaced about two centimeters apart_ widening them with the fish scaler (first time I ever used the fish scaler) until they were about as big around as a pencil. I kept another empty Progresso can (this one unmodified) for snuffing out the stove.,Rachel_Silver,gizmo2077,8,1,1,3,1530

I couldn't get back to the road.  Fortunately I was working for a pallet maker not far away. In the morning I grabbed a handsaw from the company shop and cut my way out.

It sounds like you're well onto the path of improvement.  We're being refined through the fire of this world_ and growing as individuals despite the way it feels like we're merely existing.  Your best friend sounds like an absolute blessing.  I reached out to my youngest childhood friend_ but he wasn't able to offer me a spot_ mostly because of his uptight wife.  It is what it is.  At the risk of sounding patronizing_ 22 is still so young_ and most people at that age in modern nations barely have a clue who they really are_ what they need or even want.  You're going through an education that no college can offer.  And yes_ I had to stop attending church in my teens and delve into Scripture for myself before I ever woke up spiritually.  Song of Songs is a favorite_ the most beautiful love poem ever written_ in my view.  Ecclesiastes is fascinating_ and the Psalms are so raw and honest.  Proverbs for wisdom and grounding.

j6xyr7k,"Ok... Things to get...  1. Enough cardboard to make a four layer bed 2 enough cardboard to make blankets (2 layers) if you don't have 3. An empty beer or beverage can 4. A condom (bare with me...) 5 as many garbage bags as you can.  First you want to locate a spot where the wind and weather will be minimized. It's a good idea to frequently check the spot throughout the day to get a feel of what people and wildlife will be in the area later.  Once you find the spot and have a fair idea of the atmosphere_ you can either store your cardboard close to the spot or carry it around all day. It's totally up to you. If you are going to store the cardboard make sure you cover the majority with a garbage bag or something to reduce the amount of water or moisture the cardboard collects.  Once it is time to sleep or you are ready to ""relax for the night""_ grab your cardboard making 4 layers or as many as possible under you remembering that the most important area you want heat to reflect back to you is your torso and abdomen.   If you don't have a blanket_ that's where the extra cardboard comes in (if you have enough which you should_ cardboard is free and in trash/recycling bins) there are two ways to go about covering yourself or using cardboard as a blanket.  1 cut the cardboard at the seam making it as long as possible and drape it over you. Not the best idea if it's windy.  2 if the box is wide enough for you to fit your abdomen in lay as many boxes OPEN as you need to cover your body. Like a tunnel on top of the cardboard layers that will reflect your body heat. Crawl into your cardboard tunnel_ and flatten the boxes so that most of your body is enclosed. Get back to me on this part if you need further instructions. I'm still figuring out how to word these instructions...  3 For heat just in case you feel the need throughout the day or night_ that's where the beverage/beer can and condom come into play. I'm not going to go into instructions on this because there's already a video I posted on YouTube and in this Sub...

Perhaps find some bubble wrap because air is insulating and a garbage bag and fill it with grass and things for more insulation. You can build up a little shelter under some trees and add extra boxes. It will do you till you can find some better materials. Air = insulation. I'll do some more research for you if I can.

I tell you all this because I've been where you are now. I've felt the same longing_ sadness_ and struggle. And I can see the path ahead of you is bright. You've fucking got this.

j6sy4sg,"I realize that this might sound very specific... but try to find a 24 hour non-chain coffee shop.. or coffee/donut shop.  You had good luck at this Waffle House... but the chain itself has rules_ and at some point_ someone working there is going to want to enforce them.  It is one of the problems seeking shelter at any kind of retail chain organization.  At some point_ they can and will fall back to using some variation of the phrase ""I'm sorry_ it's just our Policy."" on you... because in doing so_ they can pass the responsibility on to someone above them.  With finding a non-chain shop_ you are dealing with the policies of an owner... potentially an owner-manager.  One person can bend their rules easier than an organization can bend their rules.  The situation you are in can be appealed to an actual person where the buck stops.  They can \*see\* you aren't trouble_ and maybe they can even help_ or trade light work for product.  They are far more likely to wave off ""insurance concerns"" than some large corporation operating a few thousand locations around the country.  Probability.  Probability_ versus possibility.  Like.. playing the odds.  You have better odds at getting sympathetic treatment from an individual than you are from an organization.  Thus... seeking shelter at odd hours with a high degree of probability that they would be sympathetic to your situation_ means looking for independent businesses as opposed to chains.  It is also more probable that one could trade sweeping or taking out trash_ for coffee_ at an independent coffee shop versus any kind of chain shop or restaurant.  This is a Google template search for ""[local 24 hour coffee shop](https://www.google.com/search?q=local+24+hour+coffee+shop)"" and when you follow it_ it will show the 24 hour coffee shops near you.  Check out any and all of the independent ones.  You could even rotate between a few_ so as not to spend two nights in a row at the same one.  Also... with 24 hour coffee/donuts... as cheezy as it sounds... the police become an asset as opposed to a threat.  If you are there_ and the people in charge have no issues with you being there_ when the cops show up for coffee_ they are actually looking out for you as just another patron_ instead of just looking for you as something to be removed.  And of course_ just about all of them have free WiFi_ just like their corporate cousins.  You also have a higher probability of being able to just get hot water_ because you brought your own tea bags/hot chocolate packets.  Less corporate means less pressure on profit per hour_ per table.  At least_ a higher probability of less focus on those things at an independent coffee shop.  At least_ this gives you a goal and direction for nights_ while you figure out what to do.  I'd hit libraries during the day.",bongart,0xca_,100,4,1,8,1024

They won't ask for it for the food.  Idea has some cheap hot food as well.  Taco bell has the cheapest best fast food.  Ranch burrito which is a good size is $2-$2.50 depending on the region.  Ask for a water cup (free) then fill it with soda.  At Costco or taco bell fill a giant container with soda for later with ice (free).

Unfortunately I had to bow out, as I needed a car for logistics and to be able to change clothes etc without carrying a massive backpack everywhere.  My folks have 2 cars but only need one.  My narcissist dad refused to lend me the car to see if the job worked before putting the title in my name.  It may seem odd, but I've waited tables before and presentation/hygiene is a major thing.  A car would've made it easy.  Without a car, the simple things become complicated.  Feel gutted and frustrated.  Congratulations though mate!  Keep a positive attitude and get into a groove at work.  Stack up those checks!
10q2vod,j6rxjsd,,SSI, Snap, ebt all work with no actual address. Was homeless in Madison County AL free years ago, I know it's not a state requirement. Also, there are multiple organizations and shelters that have staff whose sole job is assisting with paperwork for benefits id's and such at no cost to the individual. If you're being fed the no one will help line cut the person telling you this out of the equation and look into resources.     So, seperate from that a few things you will want to look in to. 1 gym or campground membership. These places have shower/restroom facilities you can use, are cheap, just don't stay there all day every day. 2 libraries are your friend, as a resource for info/net access, a place with free water via fountains, and a place to escape the elements. Nothing worse than being stuck outside in freezing or wet weather. Or stuck in 95 degree humid swamp in the summer. 3 if staying local locate your nearest food banks, soup kitchens, and cheaper grocery stores like food value, aldis, dollar general/tree. 4 Keep toothbrush tooth paste and dry socks available. Like honestly you're better off skipping a meal than not having dry socks and clean teeth. Infected feet or infection in the mouth are both extremely painful and pretty much require a hospital visit. It's not worth the risk.

10q2vod,,j6qf58c,They do not
10q2vod,j6nibaq,,Zillow. Find a bank in your county, walk in. Explain how much your check is, tell them they can have it all, you only need 2 acres somewhere in Alabama to list as your address so you do not lose the check. Do not accept a rental, or anything fancy. Take a run down rotten hoarder property, anything to maintain an Alabama address. Tell them you can handle all the normal people needs like toilets and utilities some other way. All you need from them is a place to put in a garden and have a physical and legal address. Most banks have too many houses and they prefer monthly payments. Do not get big ideas, get the worst, cheapest one, so you can pay it off the fastest. Tell them you have all the other details worked out without them and you di not feel comfortable with a long term mortgage. Visit about 6 dozen banks.

10q2vod,,j6va9mh,I once had a wild idea to ask churches and charities if i could park in their lots over night, sometimes. When i became homeless i ended up in my car in a place where homelessness doesn't exist. Shitboxes houses that i would never buy sell for $1 million +/-. I asked one charity if they are affiliated with any churches in the area. They are not. After walking and driving around the area i've realized the wealthier population is much worse than where i came from. They don't give time of day and snow in winter. Now i feel extremely uncomfortable asking churches for anything.   Anyone who's near participating religious organizations that openly advertise and offer services are lucky. Not where i am. Homelessness is criminalized and non-existent here. Even post offices refuse to provide mail service for homeless, told me they don't participate, don't know what it is, no one ever asked.
10q2vod,j6v8g9n,,I'm already homeless but don't get SSI because the idea is to deny until my problem resolves itself or i become exhausted and disappear.  I don't think you need an address for SSI payments. It goes into your bank account. My local bank needs an address for me to create an account. I gave my old address because i haven't updated any of my documents and have no new address or proof of any address. I won't be able to pay $24 to the state to update my license every 4 years. I'm not worried about updating and not going to waste money on this nonsense especially if i have no address and no support for at least decent safe housing. I want a tiny space with a private bathroom and shower but i want it in a trailer or container or a tiny home, not in a high risk population area.  Doesn't SSI allow you to apply for a housing voucher? I'm in nj. The system here labels and criminalizes all homeless. It forced everyone into dangerous shelters. I refused. Whoever refuses to go to a shelter is not really homeless. My idiot disability lawyer told me in the beginning i'd be able to get housing when i get SSI but social services told me housing is not guaranteed even for disabled. In other words i'm on my own regardless of my circumstances. There's no support. I'm unable to get usps mail service for homeless. All locations refuse because they don't participate. No homeless population here. I told agencies including soc services and soc security not to send me any mail because i have no address. They continue to send mail to my old address. They can't have the address blank.
10q2vod,,j7muz5o,I was told that if I didn't have an address where I paid rent that the amount was reduced. I know that's true for the temporary cash assistance until your ask is approved but I didn't verify if true for the actual SSI. My cash assistance with a place is $233 a month. I pay $7O rent and electric was 50ish but rates almost doubles so probably $100. I get $63 a month. I use MMJ and that's out now. My doctor just prescribed me Marinol which is synthetic THC in a pill to hopefully help since the marijuana works so well. Otherwise I have to go up on gabapentin  a nd up on my Klonopin. Its already hard to be coherent on my Gabapentin. Im going to be half unconscious drool drooling.
10q2vod,,j7ndz2m,Gabapentin and a few others are pills of choice for pill pushers. Pharma must be giving them good incentives to push gabapentin and others. I've been offered it but i refuse. I'd rather be in pain. Not terrible now but eventually it'll progress.

There are people here who would do almost anything to be in your situation instead of in a car or tent or shelter ... or worse. Know your audience. This ain't it.

10przqa,j6moaw9,,Got my CDL and went over the road so I could live in my truck
10przqa,,j6mthiw,Not a bad idea
10przqa,,j6n32pg,I've actually enjoyed it. But I wanted to start 20 years ago, so it was something that's always been in the back of my mind. Helps that I'm a minimalist by nature.  I do plan on getting actual housing once I'm debt free (another contributing factor on the decision to be homeless), that's at least 2 years away though.
10przqa,,j6qqpvu,That’s awesome!  That’s one of the safety fallback options I’ve been thinking about, too.  I was also thinking about working on a ship (seems harder than I hoped), or moving to somewhere crazy cheap like Bulgaria. There’s a lot of digitial nomads there, which, if you think about it, are just cunning homeless people who’ve hacked themselves a better lifestyle. lol.  Which companies do you recommend, if I may ask?  I was thinking of getting the CDL through KLLM, but I’m open to others.
10przqa,j6m8xjv,,I met so many people at the homeless shelter that were there simply for this reason. And they had really good jobs too.
10przqa,,j6n582v,Yeah lol as soon as you say how it is and that the males are absolutely exploited in child support cases you'll get downvoted. No one gives a fk about males in this world.
10przqa,,j6macwa,That's really sad... I know kids need support, but the system that is in place in most states is really fucked up and doesn't factor that the parent paying support also has to survive.
10przqa,,j6mao3e,I had 2 jobs, they were taking $298 each CHECK from each job. One paid weekly and the other bi-weekly. $1788 a month is what was going to child support.
10przqa,,j6ni5dr,She probably spent $88 of that on actual child’s needs.   🤷‍♂️
10przqa,,j6mc1dn,Jesus... which state and how many kids? That's insane.
10przqa,,j6mc6le,2 kids. Utah. I had custody, too which was the more frustrating part. it was back child support.
10przqa,,j6mc9h4,Wow... I'm sorry dude. Are things better now?
10przqa,,j6mcdin,Still owe money unfortunately lol. But dealing with it as best I can. Not much else you can do when you owe the government money. But I did finally purchase a condo and things are looking up.
10przqa,,j6mcfz4,Yeah... once they have you on the hook you are screwed. Modern day slavery.
10przqa,j6msn6a,,Yes. Happened to me. Paying child support  caused me to lose my apartment.  No one gives a damn about men in this situation. We have to suffer in silence.In the end, the kids don't give a damn either about me.
10przqa,,j6mzs0m,That's why you don't have kids, especially with shitty women.
10przqa,,j6odzm2,The courts want you to pay them and they pay the women. So they can sic the dogs (police) on you.
10przqa,j6pdc9k,,i knew someone who lived in their car. it’s not for everyone but always an option
10przqa,j6zu76a,,I lived in a tent. Showered at my X's house. Had a massive breakdown. Still recovering two years later.
10przqa,j6o0t0k,,You ate not homeless just because of child support. And if you are paying more than the state guidelines should have you pay, then file for an adjustment most of this can be done online without an attorney.  The CDL is a good idea....also if you are broke on 1 job then pick up a side gig doing something. Rent a room or rent a house and rent a room out.
10przqa,,j6qqz1n,Basic costs are so out of control now, I can definitely believe extra expenses like this causing homeleness.  It’s hard enough just to buy damn eggs. At least if you’re in the US!
10przqa,,j6qsdyk,I realize that but kids are a financial responsibility.  He would have to still help support the kids even if he was still with the mom
10przqa,,j6qua3q,Oh absolutely. He needs to pay for his kids, no matter what. I wish men didn’t see this as optional.  I’m just saying that everything is so expensive now, that almost any cost can push you over the edge.  In America, we’ve been taught since birth to be hyper independent. We’re even put in little cages, often in another room, as infants. But this hyper independent way of living doesn’t work anymore now everything is so expensive.   Now post-COVID we really need to live and work together to afford anything. We basically gotta instantly learn as adult to somehow live like they do in other countries. Learn to share the expenses for everything. Or at least learn to live like Hispanic and Indian people live in here in the US.   Unless you’re a huuuge earner, you either work and live as a team now, or you die.
10przqa,,j6qyyyd,I do not see this as optional. But imagine for a moment that 50% of your wages are garnished before you even see your paycheck. Ok.. so get a second job? They will garnish that as well. Get a higher paying job? The parent receiving child support gets to request an adjustment. Now you pay even more.  Fall behind? They fine you, then suspend your passport and drivers license, making it even harder to work. The child never sees the interest and fees that are applied.  I have never missed a payment. NOT ONE PAYMENT. I've missed work due to illness, injury, hurricanes, being laid off, and I've still managed to make every single payment. They still fuck up every so often due to computer glitches"" that cause me to have to miss work to go to the courthouse_ and ultimately pay some bogus fine that nobody there has any explanation for.  The child support system is no where near as straight forward as many would like to assume_ and generally speaking it is the father that gets continuously screwed over_ all while getting to see their children less and less.  &#x200B;  Yeah... it's fucked.",Vapur9,swimandfriends,5,3,1,8,1024

j6luse2,In my car living days I had a squirrel that would come to where I parked and shared my trail mix with. Cool little dude. There's something nice about having an animal friend. It brings you peace and a connection. It's like_ here's something that doesn't care about how I look_ won't judge me_ just wants to hang out and eat peanuts.   It sucks that the dog isn't with you anymore but for the time you had together_ that dog was your buddy_ and you gave it your care and love. That's something few of us ever get enough of. Know that your dog friend got a lot of love from you_ that was a gift you gave it. You were able to show another creature compassion_ maybe the most they ever experienced_ and there's so many that just don't get any. You did a good thing. Keep making those connections_  keep showing love and compassion.,81Scales,veryberryblue,21,6,1,3,1530

j6lsmne,I mean_ I get that you're going through a lot but your life story involves buying a house_ spending all your savings on Christmas gifts and weekly trips to a thrift store for clothes. People here don't rent or live with relatives_  they live in shelters or in tents or their cars. They're able to log in through free wifi they get at the library or the local Starbucks. Don't get me wrong_ it sounds like you're having a tough go_ but this may not be the right sub and frankly it's a little hurtful to make the comparison of what you're going through to homelessness.   That being said...  Your husband sounds like he may have budgeting issues as well some control issues. It sounds like he wants to make all the major decisions himself despite your significant contributions to the family. You two need to have a long and frank conversation about your financial goals and how you can achieve them. If he's not on board_ then_ as much as it would be difficult for the kids_ a divorce may be the best option. You are miserable and I'm sure your kids can feel the tension_ it's not healthy for them either. It is unfair to you and your kids to have your goals and your hard work to achieve those goals undermined and erased by your husband's poor decisions. Yes_ the housing situation is not ideal_ and I would say suck it up until you have enough saved...but you're not able to save_ so this goes from a temporary stint to a life imprisonment. Unless you can come to an agreement with your husband about the future of your family_ your SHARED goals_ and what each of you will do to reach them_ I would genuinely consider your options on making your goals achievable without him. It sucks. It's a crappy situation with no winners_ but unless an agreement can be made and stuck to_ it's going to get worse. Good luck and remember_ unfortunately_  some people can't change. If it doesn't work out_ it doesn't work out_ don't chain yourself to a life of misery out of good intentions.,81Scales,static48,0,11,1,3,1530
j6le0ym,Not sure if it applies to this sub but I’ll let others chime in on that.   I would post to r/roomateshaming maybe? There’s also specific marriage subreddits that could be helpful for advice too.  r/marriage and r/marriageadvice could be a good start.,meowsandroars,static48,0,5,2,3,1530
j6lmzsr,This is a lot of unfortunate events to happen - I am really sorry to hear you are going through all of this. It is hard to think clearly and objectively when you are in the middle of so much aggravation. The fact that you and your husband do not agree on a way forward is a further complication.  Here are the issues_ I think_ as you laid out: 1) you are living in a very small house with people you do not get along with. The house is so small you and your husband cannot sleep in the same place. Your husband does not want to leave this house_ while you feel like you need to have your own space. To put it mildly_ the two of you are not on the same page on this.  2) money issues are rampant. You are currently trying to save money to be able to move out. Your husband gives his money to his parents_ which happened without him telling you. Again_ the two of you are on separate sides of the issue.  You did own a house for a while but decided to sell it and essentially lost the stake you had in it_ bringing your savings back to zero. This was a mistake on both your parts. We all make them. But hopefully you will learn something from that and be wiser in the future.  3) your stuff in a storage unit is another issue_ though one easily remedied. If you want to retrieve your clothes or other items you could do that yourself whether your husband wants you to or not. Bring some of your family members (father_ etc) and I am sure they will help you.   Honestly I think you should move out. You don't necessarily have to divorce your husband if you don't want to. Plenty of couples live apart for a time - think of military families_ for example. Move out_ retrieve your stuff_ keep your finances separate from your husband_ and let him figure his stuff out on his own. Either he will grow up and stand up for his family or he will stay tied to his parents. He may feel like he owes them or guilty for all of the problems at their house_ but at the end of the day he has to make a choice.  Part of your distress right now is that you are uncertain as to what you should do. Making up your mind as to a way forward will bring you some peace.,rtodd23,static48,0,6,1,11,964
j6n6bae,I understand that you want to stay near family_ but you also say you can't afford to. You're going to have to make a choice. And frankly_ you don't need advice from the people on this forum.

j7ypgjd,You take what you can get _ life sucks and sometimes you have to do stuff you don’t like to get ahead_ if you can’t afford to live where you are now you need to move ASAP to better your situation_ you can’t rely on family or anything to help _ if y i I really want to improve your life you have to do it yourself and sounds like you have a bad husband _ if I was were you I would leave him _ he’s holding you down and manipulating you.,Mondai88,static48,0,2,1,11,964

j6n8jg4,Thankfully I had some supplies I could use already. But main thing was making sure I had a vehicle I could sleep in. Meaning working heat and room to hold stuff/lay down. For me its a minivan. I've got some thick foam mattress pads_ a sleeping bag_ and some blankets I use for a bed.   I have a cheap car plug in pot that will warm water (it's not strong enough to boil but it was only about $40). Ramen and some cheaper frozen pre-cooked meats (chicken nuggets aren't bad price per ounce) heat up fairly well. I'm in a cold climate so I don't have to get ice for my cooler as often either. And I do the gallon water refill at walmart every few days.   I have a gym membership which let's me shower_ and I bounce between a few truck stops for overnight parking and bathroom access.   I've only been homeless a bit over a week but I had less than 2 weeks to prepare. Thankfully I had some help getting started but all the shelters in my area are full and housing assistance has been backed up for years (this was a problem even pre-covid in most area). Also I was out of work at the time too. Thankful to be starting a job today acrually.  My biggest concerns are staying warm and hydrated. My biggest fears are not having money for gas (heat and electric) and being sent away from the truck stops. I just limit my usage as much as possible.  My suggestions if you have the ability would be to invest in privacy/insulation for windows on your vehicle and finding a cooking pot that can boil water.,Kaunan_,veryberryblue,19,3,1,3,1530

I was in a shelter and the landlord said I can move in any time I wanted_ so I did..with nothing. I got about 7 thick blankets from the shelter and slept on the floor the first night. That night.. heartburn from nowhere_ and I saw a ghost_ well heard it. He was twirling my thermos around that was on top of the frig. Woke up in so much pain_ but it was okay.  I was afraid too. So afraid that if I went to the store or something_ I would come back and find the locks changed. Took me a while to get over that. And then there is the people who didn't get help yet_ the looks. I didn't know what to say_ so I said nothing.  Then there's sleeping in a place by myself. I'm not use to it being this damn dark outside and so quiet.

j6nhus0,"Homeostasis is a set of human states where both the body and the mind begin the healing process.  It will not begin in full until you are removed from the perturbations that cause you stress. The stresses caused by homelessness keep your body and mind in the state called fight-or-flight_ which doesn't allow for the type of healing that occurs within true homeostatic states.  This is why it is imperative to establish your new home as _safe space_. Safe space can become healing space if we keep it safe. After that_ if it becomes healing space_ the potential is there for it to become _sacred space_.  Sacred space is where we thrive. Survival is a victory_ but a human life can do far more than simply ""win"". A human has the potential to heal and heal other people.   But you can't get there if you betray the space_ and what that space can be. You must establish healthy boundaries with others so that your apartment can possess that power in your life. You must not trust others to stay with you if they don't have the same goal in mind for your apartment.   You have to believe in your ability to heal by yourself. You have to become a whole person by yourself first. You cannot help other people heal until you get there_ and you can't get there when you dread your own home.  Loneliness betrays us before people do. Trust is built over a long period of time. A home gives us the luxury of time_ because we can lock the door. So_ until someone proves that they are worthy to step foot into your home_ don't let them.

I had a similar case where I had to leave situation after situation that living in my car feels like my own place to be safe and free. I'm to worried to leave my car alone too long also. I guess the best part about having your own place is shower_ laundry and a quiet peaceful place. Use that to your advantage and develop good habits. You will get good sleep and be clean and comfortable. I worry to much about owning furniture too beacuse I don't want to spend money on it if I'm just going to have to abandon it. If you do need furniture I would recommend goodwill or arc. They have lots of stuff that's usually cheep.

But again this is private religion_ not government.  In the US_ Christian churches do it a lot but usually as part of missionary work rather than charity.

j6kzfwt,I was a job corps residential advisor for about six months after I retired.   I think it is great resource for young people who are looking for a trade.     It may vary by location_ but the one I worked at was very strict towards the students. 10 pm lights off and strict quiet time on weekdays and midnight on weekends.   I can’t remember the time_ but it was a very early wake up with mandatory room clean up and common area assigned cleanup assignments which were inspected every morning by staff.  Time off the facility is restricted at first but eventually you will be able to go off the facility on weekends if you have a place to stay.   Any drinking or positive UAs gets a student removed.  I brought that up because I feel some are set up for failure because the recruiters don’t mention that and a lot of student get sent home_ whether they have a home or not.   So if anyone feels they can’t abide by rules_ which in someways were  stricter than when I was in the marines_ don’t bother going.  That being said_ all student who don’t have a high school diploma or GED will get that knocked out first.   Each job corps location offers multiple trades to train in and there may be a wait for the trade you selected.   While you wait they may put you in another trade with room.  Admin assistant was the trade most of the people went through while waiting.  My location had heavy equipment operation_ heavy equipment repair_ CDL_ electrician_ general construction_ some medical programs where the student went to the nearby community college_ and possibly carpentry and plumbing.  They do help student find a job.  I met several students who were homeless and they all seemed to do well.  The older students all seemed to do well also.   The sixteen and seventeen year olds seemed to have the least success in my opinion and caused a lot of problems for the other students because of the military like group punishment.     They should have had a separate dorm for them.   I would recommend attending.    Several students I personally new ended up making over a $100_000 a year once they had just a little work experience in the field.   Welding and heavy equipment student did really well working the pipelines.   A lot of electrician students ended up as union apprentices_ and the CDL students over 21 all had jobs waiting on them when they graduated.,JBinWyo,acathedralingermany,10,6,1,3,1530

j6htl6h,Are there any local agencies that will help you bridge the gap? It sounds as if things will be looking up very soon.  I’m not familiar with your area_ but generally the Salvation Army and other such organizations receive a great deal of federal money as well as money from utility companies to assist those behind on their bills. The caveat is that they may require a disconnection notice first.   If you don’t want t to go that route_ you can probably call or set up a payment plan online that will postpone your payment or break up any past due amount into payments spread over the next 3-6 months.  As for rent_ same deal. As a single person_ it’s harder to get assistance if any kind_ but call your local social services office and google “rent assistance” plus your zip code to try to find resources. Don’t give up!  As for getting your mental health on track_ if you don’t have a doctor or insurance_ contact your city’s community services board for a list of free or sliding-scale treatment options.  If you are really feeling hopeless_ call or text 988. It’s a confidential mental health crisis line and just having someone to talk things through with might go a long way toward making you feel like you can start to get a handle on this.   If you haven’t been eating well_ please update with your zip code. I’m sure there are food pantries and other resources to help get you through the next few weeks and people will be more than happy to help.  Again_ it sounds like you have a lot to look forward to. Don’t let depression lie to you and convince you there’s no way out except homelessness.

j6h9izd,Consider [Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)  The base layer **Physiological** needs include many things that can be difficult for homeless people to attain:  Heat_ clothes_ hygiene_ food_ shelter_ and sleep to name a few.  The second tier is **Safety**. Basically everything in this tier is difficult for homeless folks to maintain:  Health_ personal security_ emotional security_ financial security.  Third tier is **Love and Social Belonging**_ and in most cultures homeless fall into their situation thru the lack of social safety net_ and our culture actively ostracizes and shuns them.  Family_ friends_ intimacy_ trust_ acceptance_ and giving and receiving love and affection.  **Esteem** is the fourth tier_ and includes both self esteem and the esteem of others - how much you are respected as an individual. Also a difficult thing for homeless people to acquire.  The tiers above involve these four are about mental enrichment and (surprise surprise) are also going to be difficult for homeless to achieve.  But the idea of the hierarchy is that you need to build from each tier_ and that someone who can’t reliably acquire food won’t have the ability to really prioritize their safety. Someone who feels unsafe won’t be able to find stable love and social bonds. A person who can’t form love or social bonds won’t be able to cultivate esteem.  So on and so forth.  Basically homeless people are fucked when it comes to achieving happiness. Every disadvantage is weighing them down_ and it is a failure of our society and our ability to empathize that we continue to allow it to happen. People who can survive being homeless have suffered extreme mental distress_ and have tested the bounds of what humans can endure.  For me personally the third and fourth tiers were the stumbling block_ and even though I had the privilege of the first two tiers being OK_ I wasn’t able to resolve the third and fourth until I was no longer homeless.,Warp-n-weft,Give2Win,10,7,1,3,1530

We got into our own place in 2021. We have a beautiful 3 bedroom apartment. The first thing I do is pay the rent thats the first thing I do. We got all our furniture from our local buy nothing and everything is free groups. I told them we just got out of a shelter and had no car and they dropped off all our furniture and we got towels_ kitchen items_ everything we needed. If you can get a referral from the group that helped you they need to send an email and you can go to a furniture bank and pick out everything you need. Also if anything ever happens again God forbid_ knock wood. This group in nevada helps with crates and free vet care and if you go on their website you can find free pet food donation sites and lots of resources. Keep it on hand.

j8i91m9,While I can't personally answer your questions_ I think it's really cool that you're trying to get first-hand perspectives for your essay. And comparing and contrasting cold climate homelessness vs. warm climate homelessness is definitely an interesting topic!   It's important to consider the unique challenges that people facing homelessness in different climates may encounter. For example_ those experiencing homelessness in colder climates may have to contend with freezing temperatures_ snow_ and ice_ while those in warmer climates may have to deal with extreme heat and dehydration.  n terms of shelter_ people in cold climates may need to find ways to stay warm_ such as seeking out heated buildings_ using blankets or sleeping bags_ or building makeshift shelters. In warmer climates_ shade and access to water may be more important.   As for food_ people experiencing homelessness may have to rely on food banks_ soup kitchens_ or other resources to get their meals. In colder climates_ finding hot meals may be particularly important_ while in warmer climates_ access to refrigeration or cool storage may be more of a concern.   Overall_ it's important to remember that homelessness is a complex issue with many different factors at play. It's great that you're trying to better understand the experiences of those facing homelessness in different climates.,anufriievvitalii,PlatosAxiothea,0,2,1,3,1530

It requires a case manager with specific training and certification in the program to oversee your case and submit a narrative_ but it can expedite the process to as little as 8 weeks. Many community service boards and some agencies coordinating support for homeless individuals_ particularly veterans_ have someone on staff to handle this. It’s extremely thorough in collecting required documentation_ so approval rates are in the 70-80% range.

If you're cleanish_ it's easy enough to get by. There are 4 or 5 meal programs within 3 miles of me. All open during weekday mornings.   Also getting around to get your needs taken care of is doable. The bus system has light / no security. You can hop on and hop off and noone will say anything. Lots of locals included in that unspoken system   It's not easier though. 8/10 people are just stuck up. People don't talk to me because they believe I'm a hiding drug addict and they have trust issues_ so they'd never believe the truth coming from me.

j788bgq,I think the problem is you give details people don’t or won’t understand.  I think we all do this_ especially when we really need help_ and are so traumatized we don’t know which details matter  The irony is that if you leave some details out (lie by omission)_ then people wouldn’t call you a liar.   You may be too traumatized to be able to share this with a judge mental audience. (I’m sort of experiencing the same things tbh. I have to leave things out so people believe me — but I don’t always know what to leave out eek)  Are you able to get Medicaid so you can see a therapist trained in trauma? That’s what I’d recommend.  If youre at 0 or near zero_ call Medicaid and tell them on the PHONE. They should approve you immediately. Do it before the pandemic status wears off. It’s easier now but it won’t be in a couple months  Just do this then get a psych.

A little different as we had made agreements as too the logistics of our divorce which she then threw away because I had the audacity to enforce my boundaries.   After I few days I was able to sit down and take a hard look at my financials and realize that if I wanted to afford therapy and some medical care of been putting off_ I couldn't afford housing and the expected support order. And payoff the debt from the marriage. Decided a career change was in order.   Found a company that would house me during CDL training_ then I could live in the truck while working.

j68zdf9,It is my belief that what you said you changed is the actual reason why 12 Step programs like AA help a lot of people. It gives hope to others and ourselves. Its not the spirituality or anything else. It is people helping each other get better. It is holding onto each others bootstraps.                I have horrible PTSD and this is inspiring to me. Homelessness made me bitter and so mistrusting_ perhaps I need to help others just to help them. The worst fear and sense of desperation I have is that I won't ever be able to connect with people again the way I did before homelessness.  The selfishness during Covid kinda cemented that I was right in the feelings homelessness inspired. Half the country supported a President that made fun of disabled people in his campaign and refused to wear a cloth on their face to help protect fellow human beings while simultaneously waiting flags and proclaiming their Patriot towards the country and support of troops. Patriotic people join the military and pledge to give their lives (albeit mostly for bullshit propaganda) but a cloth mask was too much inconvenience.

They're all over the US_ it's part of Catholic Charities_ and you don't have to be Catholic to get help.

I'm not even religious_ but I can't say enough good things about them_ at least in the 2 states I've had to use them until I could get back on my feet and find a way out of being homeless. I am disabled and at the time_ was in a partial body cast from major spine surgery.

j67itkn,Regardless_ she should still call 911_ Fish and Game_ or the Forest Service. They most likely aren't going to care about her being homeless_ they're going to see it as a survival situation. Whether OP's homeless or not. Their imperative is to ensure her survival and safety by getting her out of there. Abandoned is stranded_ and it doesn't matter if its in a remote area_ or a popular campground; it's ultimately the concern of whoever's in charge of the area. Nobody wants the land they're managing to be the place where someone got hurt or died. Whether it's by sketchy people or otherwise. That's terrible for everyone (especially for those working there).   I'm saying this as someone whose father worked in wildlife and fisheries. They're usually pretty understanding of people's situation_ and it's common for them to help people out. As there's emergency situations that happen all the time in the outdoors. They might even be able to drive her to wherever she needs to go. I'd say it's OP's best bet.

j66oh67,Our mailing addy is in Ladson. My mom lived there too. But just changing our residence from Berkeley to Dorchester opened opportunities. Berkeley is a large county but NIMBY af. I've lived in GC all but 2 years of my 38. We hang around here bc of our storage unit situation and the cops. We were told by BCSO to park at the GC walmart and had been for the vast majority of this time but_ ultimately_ one call and you can get a tresspass or just shuffled along. We hadn't even been there the day it happened but an RV was boondocking for a couple weeks and our vehicle just got tagged in a handful of repeat visitors that got the same nonsense.   I hear there is less homeless near Mt P and that they don't get harassed as much. N Chs has a camp behind Rivers Walmart and Ladson has one around CVS but the cops dont actively sweep either_ they just have a heavy presence. Still_ I'd rather have to talk to our cops over others bc of how disproportionate their reactions can be.,DevilsAudvocate,AIpha0mega2021,14,1,7,3,1530

Things are definitely changing though. Especially in Salt Lake. Provo on the other hand_ is the Mormon mecca... The biggest problem however_ was when they shut down the biggest shelter there was out there in downtown to make room for new apartments and the money invested in ""cleaning it up"".

j66tqxr,The best approach would be to divide the homeless into demographic groups and case workers and volunteer legal students help each demographic separately. For example homeless people with probable psychosis or apparent schizophrenia could be rounded up and taken to a mental hospital where social workers could help them apply for disability benefits. Homeless people who are undocumented aliens with no work papers and no legal rights to be in the country could be rounded up and introduced to law students whereupon they could be given assistance applying for an O visa. Homeless people with addiction problems could be transported to rehab/detox facilities. Situationally homeless people with no drug addiction and no apparent psychosis could be set up with an appointment at the employment center and offered a free bus ticket to get there. Jailbird recidivists on a revolving door to the correctional system probably are too difficult to help at all_ sociopathy isn’t considered curable. Some people can’t be helped.

Then get rich jerks to build a shit load fast.  Why not?  They are guaranteed profit (no risk)  sooner its built_ the more profitable (stagnet money has a cost overtime).

Issue is job market for so many_ if you work remote or from home and like home towns_ and can entertain yourself & like to take short trips.... then please look into areas that need people.    Maybe you think about being a truck driver -- just an example -- a mid-size town could work_ if you drive for a living there are still places where you can get a decent size house but have to make some adjustments. BEFORE you scalp this is being heavy discussed in many places_ not everyone can afford NYC _ Denver_ LA ...and those are not the only cities in the US.

j65h5ua,I don’t know anything about Australia or what resources might be available but heavily seconding the person who mentioned youth shelters if you have access to one or can get to an area that has one. They’re a heck of a lot better than the more general adult shelters- though all the advice about stealing and guarding your phone largely remains true. Would say it was better overall but don’t be stupid. And on the youth shelter front_ also don’t be stupid and do things other teens in the shelter might be trying to pull you along for that could get you kicked out- I saw quite a bit of that the two times I was in youth shelters. I think the peer pressure and just everyone wanting to have friends stuff is a lot harder when you’re younger. I’d look the other way_ not snitch_ and try to get along but at some point never forget to look out for you and you alone.   Youth shelter is probably the best that can happen for you. Conversely I’d keep an eye out for other young folks on the streets if that doesn’t pan out because you’re probably safer with folks your age.,Tzipity,XEpicOneX,13,2,1,3,1530

I had a safe spot to go to every night where I was allowed to be and a spot to shower and do basic grooming. I eventually got a tent and picked up a mattress that someone had tossed on the side of the freeway_ and at that point i damn near felt like I had an actual home to sleep in.   Back then the campsites were about $12-$15 a night_ so it wasn't that much cheaper than renting a room_ but I couldn't find someone to rent a room to me_ so camping was the best alternative I could find.  I tried to save money by parking in parking lots or residential areas but usually a cop would come and knock on my window and tell me to leave.

j61t28h,$3000 isn't likely to get you a very reliable van these days. Unfortunately_ buying vans and spending ridiculous money to make them into little houses is a current fad for the American middle class.

Of course_ anything at all you can sleep in is going to be great for you pretty soon since the hotels will suck you dry. Is there any way you could make your current car better for sleeping in_ though? Take out the backseat_ put in blackout curtains_ things like that. It's possibly a better option than a low cost van.

j63nuqf,I’ve been homeless in your area since Oct. I was having the same problems but things are getting better and I’ve been learning. I’m so close to being out of homelessness. Here’s what I’ll say:  Not everyone is cut out to live in a car. I can sleep anywhere. My sister_ not so much. I had to take her to the hospital for blood flow issues. Unless you plan on investing in a really REALLY good mattress make sure you’re actually capable of sleeping there. My sister went about 3 months until I literally had to take her to the hospital every night. It was terrible and I literally had to hear her cry herself to sleep every night_ and we ended up camping in the mud regardless because otherwise we wouldn’t sleep.  Assuming you’re not superhuman like me and capable of sleeping in a car indefinitely:  Look for rooms for rent that are being sublet. There’s Craigslist_ and also cheap places near colleges. Students usually have parents that have good credit scores if you need a guarantor_ just pay the other half of the rent. Put an ad on paper at the local colleges nearby. Plus there are plenty of female only college situations where you’ll feel safe_ and the parents would probably feel safer that you’re female. Not all college students party. Some are older_ some are more studious and quiet. You can even live really cheaply if there more people.  Otherwise_ look into a guarantor service_ which is a service that helps you qualify for housing BUT you take the fall if you fuck up.  Also look into renting an office and secretly living in it_ just say you’re making a start up and working 24/7 is an option. Get a gym membership for showering.  Just make sure to take care of your health. Plus if you lose the car that’s losing your home. At least with a room or place you can rely on busing or rent a car if you’re desperate.  UberEats and Doordash have literally saved my life_ but also I’m currently switching to a job in sales/life insurance. I’m just studying for my license exam atm. Look for sales jobs that are remote_ where you don’t need to find leads_ and where it’s commission based because there’s no cap on what you can make. You’ll be much happier with a job where there’s no cap on the money_ and you have an opportunity to make as much as you want.  I can even talk to the people I’m with. Maybe I can give you a link to send your resume too?  I’ve heard great things about the solar industry too!  Also_ if you’re food insecure or have trouble cooking_ multivitamins on top of EBT and food bank stuff can help you not get sick. Eating junk food and food that isn’t cooked everyday will kill you! Get free big waters from Starbucks and don’t pay for it! Drink water and get nutrients every day!  EDIT: me and my sister are both trans.

j65irly,Oh this is an interesting point I hadn’t considered. I’m in a very complex medical situation really fucking me around and eh the only person to argue with me was my jackass younger brother who was adamant I wasn’t “really homeless” because I was in a shitty hotel. Dude was dealing with his own shit and clearly some messy effed up family dynamics but I admit that I might have gotten more help sooner but was confused myself by whether I “actually counted” as I was losing my housing and had a friend covering a nicer hotel for a bit.   I definitely see how others might be thinking “eh I have a place no matter how shady and questionable to rest my head for the time being. Don’t think I’ll go try and get serviced because others need it more”. I have noticed some places are better than others at actually describing their definition of who they help or what they consider “homeless” but on its face_ yeah. I also think there’s a lack of awareness of how many of us are in these super tenuous situations but not out and out on a piece of cardboard on the street.,Tzipity,Peanutbutternjelly_,40,1,1,3,1530
j62p4sf,Because being homeless is not great. When you really think of a person's circumstances when homeless_ it is awful. By saying something different it dampens a person's feeling about someone who is homeless_ which is bad.

j60mlor,">sounds pretentious and overall unproductive. It's not like it changes    people's views on homeless people or helps homeless people.  Truth.  It's like the descriptor_ ""ladies of the night.""  Calling people who are forced to sell access to their bodies for sex ""ladies of the night"" rather than prostitutes (or 'who\*res') doesn't make their lives any easier or get at solving the problem.  It's just another meaningless tiny pushback that the system permits in order to give the appearance that it's open to changing without ever needing to do so.  The idea behind it is that calling someone 'homeless' makes that individual's lack of housing the only pertinent thing about them.  Similar to how describing someone as a junkie defines them by their relationship to drugs and ignores everything else about them.  To illustrate the difference_ the actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) was a junkie and died of it_ but people still treated him like a person_ because was also a successful actor.  He would have described as 'an actor with a drug problem' instead of a druggie.    So for homelessness_ saying_ this or that person is 'unhoused' or 'experiencing homelessness' implies two important things.  One that their lack of home is merely one of many things that make them who they are_ and secondly that that condition is temporary_ rather than defining.",SecularMisanthropist,Peanutbutternjelly_,40,3,1,3,1530

Social security never explained that part either when I showed up in person (caused me to miss my train back and I should probably be in a hospital right now because of the medical consequences of it all).

I am actually from Denver_ born and raised_ so I'll tell you that you do not want to be homeless there. Not only is it horrifically cold_ it's unsafe.

j65oec5,Learned these lessons the hard way just yesterday myself and wish I’d seen this post then. I’m not roughening it outside (thankfully because with my medical situation I’d be dead quick no matter what) but had to be out and about on a wild goose chase for what I’d hoped was going to be a housing opportunity in shitty boots in the Midwestern snow storm. Fucked up and had on some mystery synthetic blend compression socks with wool socks over those. Seems I should’ve reversed that. Saw the wool moisture wicking in action but my boots kept sporadically releasing water through the soles and while the wool kept out a lot everytime it seeped through to the compression socks it was miserable.   I spent some time in a public bathroom with the hand dryer and my shoes and socks trying to dry out and warm things up but fuck_ if only I had known to layer those socks in the reverse direction it would’ve saved a lot of hardship. (Though sharing this now because in an emergency if you can get to a hand dryer some place it works. Though learn from me- Dry out then research/ learn how to layer up better!). God I was doing the same thing with two hats. Thin cotton hat on my head with a wool knit with fleece around the ears hat over top. Will say wool on the outside sort of does best a cotton topper though. Made it take s lot longer for moisture from the outside to come in. Just was trapping any body based moisture against me. Maybe keep your cotton between two wool layers then.,Tzipity,wickedascanbe,37,1,1,3,1530
j68xdmh,Use plastic bags over the inside layer of socks as it keeps the feet warm even though wet. Also_ you can use torn off sections of an emergency blanket or large chip packets with reflective foil insides to put over your socks to radiate heat back.  However_ you do need to get boots off otherwise creates problems and having a dry pair of socks to put on to sleep in helps enormously. Wet boots aren't a problem if you use plastic bags_ you just need to dry socks then.  The 'hothands' things work too if you have money enough to get them to keep toes warm.  If you're in Midwest still its getting real cold again tonight +wind_ if you don't have face cover and do have a spare base layer_ preferably merino_ fold the body into three or so and use the arms to tie it behind your head...that way you cover face/ neck and with hat pulled down just leave the eyes exposed.,helpsaveme2020,wickedascanbe,37,1,2,3,1530
j5zl870,Came here just to say this. Cotton is great in the summer because it's light and breathable_ but it does not wick moisture! Probably fine to wear as an outer layer_ but definitely not right against your skin.   If you want something that isn't wool for your base layer there are moisture wicking synthetics.

Rescues partner with vets who offer veterinary service at no cost or low cost for sick animals_ most rescues get large donations for vet care frequently aswell.

Humans scam_ threaten_ and frankly_ are visually unappealing in most cases. Its not widely talked about but people will feel more threatened by a homeless man compared to an aggressive dog because ironically_ at the end of the day homeless are humans. This means that people tend to not perceive them as beings needing help but rather potential adversary possessing similar intelligence and capabilities as themselves seeking to take resources from them.

People have stopped looking at people as people and that is very shameful. I have always looked into peoples eyes and I’ve always been concerned about their state of being. I’ve reached out many times to people_ people have to be willing to accept help sometimes. It’s a bad time when people stop having faith in humanity and trusting each other_ but there are bad people in the world.,Perfectkore,No_Consider,80,2,1,3,1530

j610r27,Dogs and cats are sincere with their emotions_ are not able to pretend they are something they are not.  Many people do help the homeless_  in whatever capacity can_ but there is always that underlying thought/stigma that they are either lying about being homeless or lying about their homeless situation and what they want money for.  To me though_ money is money_ if they want to go buy drugs (and I have watch a homeless man I have given £50 to_ instantly get up and go buy coke with it) and it gets them through another night_ then that's their perogative.  I would suggest food/water_ but if a bottle or another hit eases the pain if their current life. I won't argue them on that.   Whereas you know a dog or cat will actually eat what you give them_ show gratitude.

So if you're behind a business building_ and no one else can see_ and it comes down to you and one other individual... It's not always easy to know what traumatized people are going to do.

j5wzfin,Being despised by practically everyone for being homeless. There were kind people but it was 90% abuse day in and day out for over 5 years. In the early days I had several people really take advantage of my situation_ work me nearly to death and treat me like utter crap.   One woman she worked me 10+ hours 7 days a week in return for sleeping upstairs on a couch in a room filled with construction supplies. I was supposed to have a much better deal but she didn't care. She basically turned me into her personal slave for 3 months until I could find a way out. The people I left her house for weren't much better.   During the time I was homeless I was spat at_ insulted multiple times daily_ had people outright hate crime me more than once and I had guys constantly trying to prostitute me. I was very lucky I survived it not being raped or worse.   The indignity of it all_ being treated like you are subhuman. That's the worst of it for me. I'm housed 18 months now but I still get stuck in the homeless mindset sometimes feeling like everyone I meet just can't be trusted. I'm still very anxious when it comes to anything that could seemingly jeapordize my housing.   I'm no longer physically homeless but in my head part of me still is and might always be. It just lasted too damn long the whole experience. It's marked me for life in a way. I can't walk down the street in NYC and see homeless people and just take it for granted that I'm not.   I actually SEE them_ as real people suffering and I know that suffering so it's not easy just walking by. I've fed people_ given away clothes and stuff.   I still don't have a lot. I'm living on SS disability but I'm still paying it forward for the good people that did help me. No matter how poor I might feel I know there are people worse off than I am. I try to help a couple of people a month in one way or another even if it's only buying somebody a $4 McDonald's meal deal or a slice of cheese pizza once a month when I get my direct deposit.   The indignity of being homeless that's the absolute worst. Even if you get out you're always looking back and thinking about the cruel stuff that people inflicted upon you. You're always double checking yourself making sure that you're no longer looking or acting homeless. You go out of your way to behave extra normal in a way so that nobody would ever guess you once were yourself.   This is why I'm so honest about having been and openly talk about it_ about living on the streets and in shelters. The stigma is still a big thing and non homeless people need to truly understand the experience so they understand why treating homeless people that way is very damaging.   I think it took me a good year of being housed to stop expecting verbal abuse from people. To feel even vaguely normal again. Being homeless it's like you're a scapegoat and an outcast. It's not an easy mindset to let go of.,mtempissmith,poet_redkiss,97,48,1,9,1231

I have the utmost respect for these people_ now that I have been in a similar situation.

Or the people who keep trying to take my cat away from me or reported me when I inferred I would off the cat and myself. They didn’t report or care about me killing myself. Just the cat. And I’m sorry but I don’t believe a high needs elderly cat who’s spent her entire existence basically on top of me (developed severe disabilities shortly after adopting her so we have always been together) is going to do too well without the single human she loves and trusts.

j61hnkj,Being homeless is probably one of the most painful experiences I've ever had because people who love and care about you will literally watch as you drown.   Cannot agree with this more. Close friends and family would complain that I was asking to use a spare room or couch in their home for any amount of time. The same people who told me countless times they would be there for me if I needed it_ that I could call them.

The hardest part for me is people treating you differently when they realize or find out you're homeless. I'm the same person_ who showers roughly as much as before and wears the same clothes_ but it's like I turned into a grubby_ scraggly_ drunk_ grizzled gold-prospector-type bugging them for a dollar rather than the person am_ standing in front of them right now.,heyitscory,poet_redkiss,97,14,1,11,964
j5xahl3,While not as bad as hardly any of these stories_ I would say hardest part is disorganization. I live in my car_ and when I was in a gym I had my car keys stolen. Then I had my cards stolen the day after (only way I had remotely any money on them was from my job and consistently doing side gigs just to make enough to eat). I can't even claim them stolen due to needing them (using click to pay when I can) because that's the only money I have despite it being a few dollars and no address to get new cards sent to (my bank is out of state). So now it takes me longer to do anything unlocking and relocking them again. Just sucks being so disorganized that I can lose/have things stolen so easily.

But they gave close to $40_000 to a local medical clinic that serves the homeless.

The only real issues for me on your list were showers and sleep. Showers_ I'd either have to bird-bath in a public toilet or_ rarely_ used a co-worker's shower if I slept over after a party. Sleep was a bigger problem because I slept on a blanket over concrete; I was in the suburbs and couldn't really camp out_ and I didn't want to draw attention to where I laired_ from fear of other homeless people and the authorities.  Otherwise_ food wasn't an issue because the suburban area I lived in had like 4 or 5 grocery stores within walking distance; I carried everything I owned in a military-sized/style backpack (a co-worker offered to take care of my roll-on luggage containing other stuff) and work was a relatively quick walk from where I 'lived'.

j5wiykm,Ooo great question I was homeless with my sibling for a year and a half and throughout my homelessness I had a lot of random people shout at me to just get a job while I was trying to fly a sign to ask for money for food that day.  I was homeless in a lot of different situations_ homelessness for everyone looks different. For me I was sleeping on concrete_ I have also slept in shelters_ in hotels and I had my own tent/campsite near some homeless resources. People assume that homelessness is often a result of laziness or drug abuse.   I was homeless with my sibling because we were born from an extremely abusive family_ from about the age of 15_ we were living with different people…in and out of homes_ so we didn’t experience a stable living situation for most of our adolescence.  Neither of us abuse drugs_ and we are actually extremely motivated people however_ given our abusive childhood_ we did struggle from mental issues and also I have a physical disability (Scoliosis). So given things like physical pain and mental issues_ such as PTSD that makes it harder to work for even a normal person.    When I was homeless_ I struggled to eat sufficient meals. Sometimes I also struggled to find a place to wash myself properly_ and I stunk a lot of the time. During the time that I slept on concrete_ I didn’t sleep much at all and I started getting very intense sleep deprivation issues. I believe in order to work a job you need basic human necessities_ such as a place to bathe_ place to sleep and food. Now these are things that you can get from living in a shelter but often times people in shelters have to be kicked out in 30 days because it’s temporary housing. You could also be in a shelter with a lot of other people and again you’re not sleeping well_ maybe you’re not eating well and maybe the environment as a whole could be triggering for you.   Both of my shelter experiences were very triggering because I was born from an awful family that also abused drugs_ so seeing people in the shelter abusing drugs_ and talking about it was not a comfortable place for me. Both times I lived in shelters I got sick a lot and I was harassed by men in the shelter as well.   One thing that is so important to understand is that most homeless people especially those in brutal homeless situations are just trying to figure out how to survive. They are thinking about what they are going to eat next and where they are going to sleep for the night. Being in that state of mind is survival mode. You cannot focus on any other task but surviving_ so a job is not important at all. Jobs are for people who have basic human necessities or rather_ I should say basic human rights. A lot of people don’t realize that when you apply for a job_ you need to put down an address to receive mail at & some people don’t even have an address that they can get mail at.   Another note is that a lot of jobs don’t pay you enough to even afford housing_ especially in very populated areas housing is extremely expensive. Going and getting a job at say Walmart or maybe a fast food chain is not going to be able to support your rent. Even people who aren’t homeless and are working jobs are struggling to pay their rent. Minimum wage jobs require 40 hours a week at least to be able to begin to afford a place. And to do so it would take a few months of saving money. I’m talking about minimum wage jobs because they’re are the most accessible and don’t require many skills. If you’re going to get a job that’s higher paying they’re likely going to deny your application if you do not have a place to live. Another huge factor of working is literally getting to work. Transportation like buses in a lot of cities can be expensive or simply does not exist. Riding a bike can also be very difficult to do if you have a physical issue or your work is very far away.  (I was only 19 years old when I became homeless and I’m almost 21 now and I still don’t have a job due to my PTSD and spinal pain. My housing isn’t stable either. I’m currently trying to get SSI income and it feels impossible. Takes forever. If I am approved it’s only $900 a month that’s still not enough for housing where I live.)   Many homeless people are disabled.,poet_redkiss,_shellsort_,2,6,1,3,1530

Only time me and my partner were asked to move it was because the cop was worried someone would call the cops on us and instead of being asked to move we'd get in trouble. He told us that as long as we weren't there past 6 am they didn't mind.  And there was a free shower truck that came around every week.

j5whpr4,Gotcha. Well on the upper hand…you’re already used to the altitude and climate I hope and it’s not far away from SLC.  I remember being about 23 years old_ just got pulled off of fire duty for the school…last we were in I think Fallbrook_ CA…maybe it was Fallbrooks. Idk.  Let me tell you…that elevation change got me good.  Typically you end up having to do a PT test with every school you go to within the Army…I had just done one at my unit not a month before and ran a 1330 2 mile.  Less than 1_000ft elevation mind you.  Got up to Camp Williams and was on pace until that last half mile…was like hitting a heavy head wind or dragging tires.   Wild weather you got there.  Think it was late October_ early November when I was up there.   It was Hot and kinda dry_ then it snowed and got wet then muddy_ windy and rainy.

There was so much freedom to go anywhere and do whatever I wanted_ but at the same time_ I was constantly in survival mode.

Be far better off buying a mixed salad bag (which BTW seem purpose made for nomads) and packets of dressing each day to get good usable nutrients and the fiber necessary to pace the digestive system to absorb the nutrients from the rest of his food. But you can't really convince people who've bought into the psuedoscience nonsense to use things that actually work because they didn't use anything but feels and contrarianism to fall into the psuedoscience trap. Sadly the poor nutrition contributes to poor mental health and in a lot of cases that devolves into a vicious snowball rolling down a mountain.

If quality of life is what you need there is more money going around in Frisco_ it is only just barely better but when it does count for something it's nice.   Being in hotter cities just means more homeless people and especially more chronic homeless people.   Do you have anyone in the shelter pushing to get you a place? Are there programs for that in your city.  The rumor I've heard is that atleast in Frisco_ they coordinate rental assistance for certain people in the shelter.

The bottom is where everyone is scrambling to get away from_ no one can be trusted down here_ this is the innermost circle of hell.

j5qdmbd,It's hard to give definite advice without knowing what kind of irritation you're talking about exactly_ but my first thought is that the wipes you're using could be the issue. Especially if they're alcohol based (but even if they're not)_ they will mess with the normal_ healthy bacterial community on your skin and essentially select for more aggressive species and strains_ which could develop into an infection of something like Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas. Wipes will also just make the seasonal dry skin of winter even worse_ which causes irritation_ too. Either (or both) of these can lead to an immune reaction like eczema or psoriasis.  Try switching to a different type of wipes and use them less. I find that the best way to stay clean without showering_ at least in the winter_ is to wear a base layer of good long johns and an undershirt and wash them as often as I need to. Go to a laundrymat that has a sink and handwash then put them in the drier.,AdeepinAmerica,Heart-Of-Aces,5,2,1,3,1530

j5rekoi,Ok bro I think I understand better now. Go to Walmart in the camp section grab a collapsible bucket and a 100% cotton bandana and a cup. You're going to get FAST at this trust me. So fill your bucket with water as hot as possible and go into a stall. Fill your cup with water and throw your bandana in it and crinkle it up scrub your whole body with the cup of water no soap just get wet. Dump the cup into the toilet grab more water in your cup and rinse your bandana off then dump it. Now soap and scrub all your skin with the cup. Now you need to get the soap off use the cup to keep your clean water clean and rinse yourself off with the bandana. The last step is the most important_ wait for a minute and press and rub your skin with your fingers and palms. if it's to wet this won't work just give it a little longer. The damp skin will literally roll off you. I don't recommend doing this to often it can be ruff on fresh skin. Just as needed. And you can use the bucket to was normally in between.,z_thefree,Heart-Of-Aces,5,2,2,3,1530

We desperately need better mental health services_ both addiction related and otherwise.   We would also benefit from education for police/local officials/other people with power as to what actually gets people off drugs (which is helping them fix their life and get stable before trying to get them sober_ instead of forcing them to detox in a facility/prison before dumping them back on the streets you found them on).  As for non drug related things_ winters here have been becoming increasingly severe in a way they have never been before. This means there aren't many existing resources the can help people when its starting to get cold. Not just shelters but assistance with supplies (hand warmers_ dry socks_ tarps_ raincoats_ close toed shoes). We also need more places that can provide a warm meal.,Heart-Of-Aces,Ouija429,3,2,2,3,1530

The social workers told me to give the patient a sober living list and i told them she wasnt a substance abuser so she couldnt go to a sober living. They explained to me sober living isnt treament focused_ its just about agreeing to live drug free while in the home to support a wellness enviroment.   They are wonderful resources for anyone who is homeless. They usually have a couple of people stay in each bedroom_ but it makes the rent super affordable. And most of them will let people pay by the week so you dont need a huge chunk of money to get in.

You usually either get your own room_ or share a room with a couple other ppl_ and it's relatively safe.  Homeless shelters for men are pretty awful. You can often expect to share a single room with 50 or more people. Most of them are pretty dangerous and your things go missing.

j5k7hsq,To be clear_ I’m homeless_ overworked and miserable and nearly freezing to death most nights trying to get myself and my family somewhere to live. If you want to talk about misery_ I can do that. I just don’t see the point. If I didn’t have a family to support_ I could easily be homeless and happy. But I have to see the abject misery on my wife’s face because she got rejected_ just like me_ to the last 20 jobs she applied to_ while struggling to do the same for myself. I already have work_ but it still not enough with how much I work. At least I know my kids are ok where they are_ but would you like to to detail to you the fucking misery of being so fucking broke that you cannot financially support your own children and spouse while working to the point to exhaustion every fucking day while only having to look forward to the fact that I made money to run the car a few hours to not freeze to death when the temps get to 15 degrees in the night? The fuck is your point? Am I not miserable enough for you? Did I not frame my misery with enough light for you? Do you wanna play the pity game? I’m miserable to the point of that suicide seems great fucking regularly_ it has begun to be a serious problem for me. Miserable enough for you?  Jesus fucking Christ what what’s you fucking point even? Go sit and be warm and be fucking happy that you are not actively contributing to the suffering of those you love because you live in a society that would rather do away with the poor and the homeless and be stuck with the horrifying fact that even if you work yourself to death that they still won’t be ok.,Paczilla2,Character_Radio_7978,28,10,2,3,1530
j5jbagc,Homelessness is something different for everyone but you got to avoid the pitfalls. I made it a point when I was homeless living in my van to stay away from the toxic ones such as the drug addicts_ the fast talking scammer types_ drinkers_ and just anyone who got trapped in the the cycle of negativity.   The only time I found peace was when I was locked in my van with the tunes going_ in my bed.   For me the key to keeping it from getting miserable was progressing I went from losing my job getting divorced and the ex-wife getting everything to living in a van started off doing janitorial jobs_ deliveries_ got myself a security guard license then an armed guard license. I made my way to becoming a cop and then a deputy sheriff.   I retired on a disability pension after a bad car accident and heart attack on duty.

I feel like I'm doing fine.   Homelessness can mean eating found leftovers before sleeping in a 3 month old t-shirt for 20m on a freezing park bench before getting arrested for loitering.

j5llgol,I think you’re already asking yourself the right question about if you’re just romanticizing it. If I were you I’d maybe not scrap the whole idea but like look into hostel at least or… I’m blanking on the name but found this through Reddit (wrong time or the year for where I’m at now and I’m disabled so didn’t think this was likely to work for me) but there are farms and such that will take volunteers and they’ll house you as long as you work and a website I’ve seen that will link you to ones around the country. I’d make some sort of plan like that over just straight up going homeless.   Because the one thing that I try to emphasize to folks and wish someone could’ve spelled out to me (didn’t really have a choice but this is definitely what took me by surprise hard) is that one of the worst things about homelessness is how hard it can be to get back out of. Like once you’re already unhoused life seems to have a way of throwing even more shit at you and kind of keeping you down. And so many of those bad things that would suck but be relatively easy to deal with while housed are a lot harder to deal with once homeless- talking thinks like an illness or injury_ being robbed_ having your car break down_ etc. even far smaller things just seem to have a way of piling up. I think I foolishly believed that being disabled would give me some kind of leg up. But nope. If anything it’s made it a lot harder.   Obviously I’m in a very different situation than you but broadly speaking it seems a lot of us never intended or expected our homelessness to continue as long as it has. It’s also stupid lonely sometimes. And dehumanizing. I suppose doing it by choice has the advantage of meaning less emotional baggage than what a lot of end up carrying (as in_ a whole lot went wrong in my life all at once that landed me in this position. Coping with that shit and trying to address those issues definitely makes things s lot harder). But still_ I’d say have a plan of some kind as much as possible.,Tzipity,Character_Radio_7978,28,1,1,3,1530

And desperate circumstances bring out the best and the worst in humans.   Some of the most frustrating and angering parts of being homeless is the loss of autonomy over your own life and the words with no actions. The way stigma informs services and funding_ as you have already seen. Often in really naive and useless ways that only make the trap worse.  Ask people what they need_ what they would like. That would have blown my mind. Especially when it comes to simple things like handouts of lotion and socks or whatever. I cried one time because I got some apples and it was just by chance they were in a box that was given to me. I had been really craving one_ but had no choices over the food that I ate.

For example_ Seattle and Portland are inundated with many homeless with drug issues because of the cities'  libertarian approach to drug possession.  Funding from the alliance can help finance more drug centers and safe places for them to gather_ rather than the streets and makeshift campgrounds.  In turn_ funding for economic distressed homeless in other areas of the country get help from the same alliance budget_ but addresses that specific problem.  Mental health services_ job programs_ affordable housing_ etc  all can be financed through this program.  Currently_ every city and region is left to its own devices and so solutions are piecemeal and inadequate.  It will take a combined effort to effectively tackle homelessness.

j5nrgk3,I don’t think that’s a smart plan. People in power need other people_ preferably a permanent underclass_ to do all the things they do not want to do. Rather than wittle down the population_ my theory is that people in power want as many people in prison/indentured servitude as possible. Remember_ when they “outlawed” slavery_ they left a loophole : it’s legal if it’s as punishment for a “crime”. It is no accident that so many things have become a “crime” ever since that happened. The people in power basically want slavery back_ so they’re making everything a crime and trying to incarcerate as many people as possible. That’s how they’re going to get their “permanent underclass” of people to do all the things they don’t want to do for the cheap.,xhighestxheightsx,logancrackdown,149,2,2,3,1530

And even if there were a bunch of people just taking advantage of the help_ why would you take resources from those who ARE struggling in order to stop them from doing so?

j5imdrh,I'm going to be straight up and blunt here_ please read this as feedback for you: Disabilaty isn't an excuse_ never has been never will be. Reality check is that you made a choice that seems like it was a mistake and now you're facing issues.  An animal may be considered a service animal under certain circumstances_ you do NOT need a doctor to sign off on this if you're in a situation such as now.  Does your animal help you emotionally such as calm you down or help when you are having a sensory overload issue? Do you have a physical issue such as getting up and down and is suppor5ed by your animal?  If yes to either of these then you can get into a shelter with the animal because legally it asists with a medical condition that is helped by the animal and is not emotional such as depression. However the legality of the animal is that if it's a dog or not. There is no such thing as a service cat or bird or lizard or whatever other animal you pick. Miniature Horses are the only other legally accepted animal.  Back to Disability_ just because you or I have an issue doesn't give you an excuse to lean on your condition.  I have 2 bad vertebrae in my neck and an Unspecified nerve disorder that causes lockups.  I push myself daily and strive to be the best I am capable of being. I don't let my issues get in my way and when they do I just push on.     You can't let your issues control your life or get in your way.  You want to use your Disability as a crutch and that's obvious_ you allow it to get in your way and fail to use what you have at your disposal to your advantage.  Your Disability should give you priority and certain protections within reasonable scope of the law and laws. Using your Disability as an excuse is bullshit. I use mine as the truth as to why I can't always do things_ there's no excuse there only fact.  Movie recomendation: Fundamentals of Caring This might help give you a new look on things.    As people have said and attmpted to get you to understand you absolutely need to call the number listed and see about getting into a shelter.

j5k4fee,"I don't agree that the OP was being ungrateful. Based on what the OP stated_ i think his friends were playing a psychological game on him. Because if they wanted rent to begin with_ they would have asked for it upfront (in the form of a contract) - not wait 12 months later to ""evict"" him and claiming that he didn't pay rent for 12 months...  So_ his friends either wanted to appear as though they are doing him a favor or maybe they do care but they realize they have made an overcommitment (12 months is pretty generous).  But they ""evicted"" him because he wasn't able to use his ""gift"" that his friends gave him (a plane ticket as a gift???). And it's not a coincidence that the friend they were sending him to cancelled on him. We see that the OP didn't pick up the subliminal message initially (his friends wanted him out)_ however_ it is not difficult to simply communicate that you want someone out of your place. No need for the mind games.  I think a written agreement should have been established_ from the beginning_ to better protect OP. Although_ we can agree that we don't know the extent of his situation_ i don't think it's okay to dismiss the fact that people can_ indeed_ be shallow. It's possible that the OP could have done something to trigger them_ but either way_ we don't know for sure.

j5fj0js,As someone with cptsd sometimes people get tired of it. They probably thought it would change or go away but it’s not a cut. It’s a chronic condition that requires ongoing and continuous care. Even when you cannot get the care from a professional you must take care with your own mental state and the ways in which it taxes you.  Even paying rent it gets exhausting. I often keep many aspects to myself among friends for this reason. I don’t want to tire them out. Damned if I’m not constantly exhausted mentally and emotionally but I don’t want to tire them out too.   So I curse the internet instead! (Lol)  You stayed rent free for a year and froze getting on the plane. That can be a valid response however you need to understand that at this point your like a house guest who stayed months longer than they thought it would take.  $200.00 is a lot of money.   While they can’t legally evict you for the agreement had_ and while they cannot even sue you for a gift you never agreed to pay back in the first place_ it would be best to leave.   Interpersonal relationships can survive many things but they cannot survive contempt_ and it sounds like you are now in a contemptuous situation and relationship.   I’ve had people claim to have ptsd to me for there reason for not trying and I’ve never had a lick of patience for it.   You’ve made no headway as far as they are concerned.   I understand it’s easy to get lost in your own head but it looks like you had the opportunity to get on the plane and now you need to call 211 and find a shelter.   What things you have_ take them or find something to do with them.  Talk to them and let them know three days isn’t legal even for a legal eviction(a legal eviction is five days_ not three_ and a judge will laugh them out of the courtroom).   If you need this much support truly_ and have Medicaid etc_ you could also try to take yourself to a mental hospital but… speaking from what I know… that may make things worse rather than better depending on how that goes. However_ on the off chance you don’t get a shitty one they can even help with getting you assistance and even in a sixteen hour program etc.,ArtLadyCat,Friendfinder2020,36,23,1,3,1530

j5g9ntd,You do not owe them for the gift. They can evict you even if you were staying for free with their permission. Generally someone who doesn't pay rent_ like someone living with their parents_ are effectively considered a month to month tenant under the law. So whatever law in your area that apply to month to month tenants applies to you. They can decide to end you tenancy with proper notice even if it was agreed you stayed for free. But you owe them nothing for the gift. The law does not allow people to give gifts and then sue to get it back except under very limited circumstances.  I would need to know the location_ or city_ to know whether 3 days are sufficient. Probably not unless they are claiming a for cause eviction. But the thing is that they can't kick you out after 3 days. To legally kick you out they have to wait till the notice ends_ file an eviction with the court_ and then have the judge authorize a forceful eviction. I wouldn't push it so far as to get a court ordered eviction_ but it might be possible to buy more time than 3 days. With a location and exactly what the notice to vacate said I could probably say more.,mywan,Friendfinder2020,36,2,1,12,1488

j5fi3dh,Hey newly homeless friend. No worries_ you got this.  Free Caffeine: Grocery stores/gas stations/donut palace/mechanics/motels - any place that offers it generally won’t charge you for a black coffee if you bring your own mug & you display good manners & charm. Treat people well.  Places Where you need to be hanging around more: Churches/Temples/Worship/Any Addiction meetings_ followed next by Civic areas like courthouse/shelters/soup kitchens. These are places where folks will passively or actively help you. Be kind_ helpful_ and more involved in helping them out and they can move mountains for you.   When you need solitude & privacy ride the bus/subway. Underpasses_ highway areas_ be sure to sleep with insulation between you and the ground_ followed by quiet empty parks (careful though for Thieves_ Karens & Cops) Lastly shitty industrial areas (but only if you’re well supplied & street smart) are pretty deserted & no one cares if you’re not destructive.   These are three “safer” places to hang out when you’re homeless. People/cops are less likely to fuck with you around these areas. You can put together a few moments of peace here. Use it to strategize: 1. Work on securing a permanent address. Doesn’t matter if it’s your bf’s cousin or a gas station. If it can receive mail_ it will make everything easier. 2. Get set up with social services_ do NOT inadvertently disappear from the system_ because of your homelessness. 3. Keep trying_ keep pan-handling_ keep connecting to people_ don’t give up! If you have trouble connecting_ try a reporter or journalist. It’s important that the voiceless be given a platform. Your story is important.   Once you disappear from society…you may end up in the classic scene…found dead_ likely from exposure behind the S-Mart down the street_ forever silent & forgotten.

j5hgm71,"This is so unhealthy and not ideal. You need to find a place you can sleep where you won't get shooed. This can can easy if you are comfortable sleeping around others. Just find the local sleep spots where other homeless stay. There are also all sorts of incognito places that will be tucked away where you can at least sleep_ maybe while sitting_ for at least a while. You need to be creative and adventurous though. You need to find spots where other people almost never go. You can also do a rotation to try and find businesses that WON'T shoo you while you are sleeping. My mom works for the state and she told me her building had a homeless man sleeping in the doorway. He would come after the building closed and would leave before anyone came in the morning_ generally. People only saw him rarely and all the staff_ being social workers and welfare workers_ were very sympathetic to homeless people. A couple people left him stuff like food every once in a while.  You really need sleep. Sleep deprivation is insanely damaging to your body and mind. I'm not just talking about staying awake for days straight. Chronic sleep deprivation will make you vulnerable to infection_ it will worsen or trigger any mental health disorders you may or may not have_ and it will cause a lot of physical pain over time. I dealt with sleep deprivation even just sleeping in a shelter since they open so late and close so early. Warming centers_ if one exists in your city or town_ will generally allow sleeping during the day until they shut down. I'd recommend going to any shelter or other homeless outreach place(welfare offices and employment offices will often know_ many churches will as well) to ask people where you can find one.  Stimulants will work. If you are an addict and are already consuming drugs_ meth or another amphetamine will keep you awake and keep you warm if you get enough calories each day. If you don't eat enough it can hasten hypothermia and weight loss though. I had a meth problem for a long time and I could sweat in a blizzard while high. I'm pretty fat so I had the fuel to burn.   You really need sleep tho. Don't do drugs if ur not already an addict. If you are an addict_ try to go to treatment. It will give you a bed and a month and often housing resources. My local treatment center prided itself on ""almost never discharging a patient who literally had no place to go but the streets"". I don't know where you are so your mileage will vary.

j5gmfex,"Caffeine pills are quite cheap and each pill is normally 200mg of caffeine_ which is equal to about 3.5 cups of coffee. If you really want to stay awake without abusing illegal stuff_ figure out how long your sleep cycles are and how many you need each night - mine are two hours long and I need at least 4 - and you can split them up through the day. They call it polyphasic sleep. You do have to kinda nail down meal timing and stuff for it work as well as it could. Also_ make sure you hydrate as much as you can. Caffeine can be a diuretic and if you don't have enough water_ it won't work as well. Frankly_ you can also try Sudafed/pseudoephedrine with your coffee_ as it's an amphetamine derivative_ and yes_ it will work like that. Red bull and anything that has a bunch of B-vitamin derivatives will work in the very short term_ but don't rely on them - it's going to work much better if you just take B-vitamin supplements. Honestly_ if you can afford it_ hit up Grocery Outlet_ grab some caffeine pills and B0-vitamins and it should help keep you up.   Finally_ if you want to go the energy drink route_ there is one called ""Double Dragon"" if I remember the name right and it has some astronomically high amount of caffeine. Back before I knew how bad it was to mix caffeine with my meds_ I would hit a few of those when I wanted to stay up super late and shit_ and whoa. They also cost like a dollar.

j5qhxyw,"Don't buy anything quickly. Think about it. Don't listen to anyone telling you ""You need to buy this"" To be honest $11 is so little I think you shouldn't buy anything with it right now. For example_ don't buy a nalagne. You can use/reuse old plastic water bottles. You can get one later if you really need it. Save that $11 for something YOU need when you actually need it.  If you only have $11_ you'll quickly realize that food and water is much more important most important amenities. Are you covered for that at the shelter?  If you're buying stuff_ BUY IT USED. Don't buy new. Craigslist_ Facebook marketplace is your haven for now. I'm assuming you have alot more time than money. Also if you have a phone_ register for facebook marketplace. (Craiglist is dead) If you are not active on facebook or have never registered before; you'll need to get approved. It took me a couple days to get on it because I deleted my FB accounts years before. (Maybe consider a battery bank if you don't have one already.)  SCOUR marketplace for free things_ cheaps things. Be nice and courteous when messaging sellers; people are really nice if you are nice to them. You may be able to swing deals or even get free things.

But if you must live in your Honda I would suggest looking for videos on YouTube of people's setups that live out of their cars. Hybrid cars are better because the engine barely runs and people won't notice you as much. I would suggest staying at 24 hour gyms or places you feel comfortable. You'll need window covers. I would suggest weathertech_ they are custom made. Use Google maps and use the satellite view to scan potential parking areas. Your biggest challenge will be figuring out where to sleep at night. I stay at truck stops and 24 hour gyms and occasionally apartment complexes. Good luck!,Lazy-Perception-5818,ratcheer,8,2,1,3,1530

Free rent is like they’re paying you $500 a month_ and you need to earn it with sweat and thoughtfulness. And you have to act grateful about them letting you stay in exchange for you practically being their live-in maid.

October of last year_ I went to Denver briefly with the last bits of my money to stay with a friend_ got locked out because his roommate and I didn't exactly see eye to eye.  My first night sleeping on the streets was there.    I never understood how lack of sleep and exhaustion could be so taxing on your mental health until that night_ and the paranoia surrounding finding a relatively safe space to sleep can be when you are out there.  You never know who will turn up_ if they'll try to steal your belongings or what.  Recently got an opportunity to stay with family in Virginia_ who I never really got along with to begin with.  The same cycle has repeated.  And now I'm getting kicked out on my birthday at the end of the month :/.  The shelter near here doesn't seem too bad and someone is letting me keep my things in a storage facility_ so there's a bit of a silver lining at least.  I really hope you can find your silver lining and a better opportunity comes your way.  If you get the chance_ there's this audiobook I listened to recently called [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu4QwpQddtg&ab_channel=MzimaAudioLibrary) that really has been helpful.

j575zak,Natural fibers are far better at keeping warm while still being breathable. Polyester is like wearing a plastic bag_ it won't keep you as warm and it won't breath_ so sweat builds up. The obvious problem here is that natural fiber clothing is generally much more expensive.  If you are able to find anything wool as a base layer that should help wick the moisture away from your body so it won't cool you down. Avoid cotton_ it is cheaper than wool or linen_ but it doesn't wick moisture as well and will have the same problem re:sweat building up close to the body. Alternatively_ there are some synthetics that are made to wick moisture and keep you warm_ those are usually athletic wear made for hiking or something. Wool socks and hiking sock liners_ wool Longjohns/long underwear_ or any other wool base layer is what I'd look for first_ then moisture wicking synthetics as a second choice.,murder-waffle,thelink225,15,2,1,3,1530
j5bbrxu,Word!  I love animal fiber for insulation and thermoregulation_ but I rarely can wear next to skin because I find even merino to be itchy (high quality brands like Smartwool_ Icebreaker_ Karo Traa etc.)  My background is camping/backpacking_ which is not the same as sleeping on the street_ but there's some overlap.  My solution is to wear really thin REI silk long underwear or really thin Patagonia capeline.  I am sure there are cheaper brands that will do the same for less $ but I don't know them.  I've heard fleece Walmart Cuddl Dudds (sp?) Brand works for clean baselayers for sleeping overnight.  You might want to look into budget Ultralight backpacking/thru hiking (eg hiking straight from Mexico to Canada) gear bc these people are hardcore about carrying very few items that need to function in a variety of environments.    Anyhow_ for layers I have very thin silk/synthetic_ then on top of that Smartwool 250 or some similar layer.  A wool or cashmere sweater would work just fine.  At a thrift store go through sweaters & search for 100% cashmere or camel if you can find it_ or 100% wool.  I buy from resellers online and if there's some moth holes_ they will sell for really cheap.   Don't wear anything tight fitting_ your initial baselayer can hug your body_ but should NOT be tight (eg yoga pants and leggings are bad). Subsequent layers should also not be tight.  On top of sweater can be more sweaters_ or a big down puffy etc.  On top of your insulation should be a windproo layer_ and if raining_ a waterproof layer.    Just beware that anything waterproof or waterproof/breathable will NOT breathe that well_ and you'll probably start sweating in it if you are walking/moving.

What cash can you come up with?  Flying a sign_ calling people you've called before for one final request for anything.... $10 even.. selling any belongings that can add dollar bills to the pile.    Somewhere near you... and by ""near"" I mean in the same town_ county_ or district_ there is a vehicle to be had.  It is going to be cheap_ and it will run.  It might be down to only having one brake operating... or it might be missing a shock absorber (I've purchased both)... but it will run and it will be dirt cheap.  It will get you to a place where the weather will not kill you_ or it will get you closer to one at any rate.  It will provide you with shelter that you can turn into a home on wheels_ regardless of the size and your budget.  Old clothes stuffed into the footwells of the rear passenger section_ can level out that seat to be a much wider bed.  You don't need to purchase some inflatable mattress to do the same.  You can even be neat_ and keep folded clothes in nylon bags_ and use THOSE to fill the footwells and the widening of the base of your ""bed"".  Or pillow cases instead of bags.  Like... sandbags_ except that's where you keep your clothes.  When it isn't a bed_ you break the bags out to get at the clothes.  That is just looking at one person can do with a couple hundred dollars (It was $300 for the van with no brakes_ and $400 for the truck with three shocks).  Now... I \*do\* actually know how insurmountable even a couple hundred dollars can seem.  This is why_ if you really do feel you are at the end of your rope_ you should consider letting go of anything you've held on to_ if it can get you to the goal of purchasing some shit-box of a car.  This is why you consider talking to people you tapped out years ago_ for one final donation.  Tell them what it is for.  Tell them why... because it will keep you off the streets_ and it will help you find the place where you \*can\* get a foothold.  It doesn't matter if you have a license.  I know.... I know.  I'm not trying to tell you to become a criminal.  Today_ if you are mobile... you \*do\* have a greater chance of being told to ""find a place to park it and don't drive""_ as opposed to them actually towing the vehicle.  Especially_ if this is the first time they are seeing/stopping you.... and you aren't currently a notation on their paperwork already.  Which means if you are going from point A to point B... and point B is a new town or state where there are resources available for you in your situation_ getting stopped by a local or state cop WILL most likely result in them letting you go.  This of course_ does vary per state.... in Washington State_ a supreme court ruling in 2018 on the state's Homesteading Act essentially ruled that a vehicle with Washington plates is a home_ and thus cannot be taken away from someone who lives in it.  Even if the person living in it doesn't OWN the vehicle_ as was the case \*in\* the legal case which sparked this decision.  A guy in Seattle_ living in a friend's broken down truck_ got the truck towed.  It was parked outside of the allowed industrial area there where overnight parking is allowed.  He got the truck back_ no legal or impound fines.  Now_ streets in Olympia look like RV parks.  The point is... get mobile_ and get moving.  It is far easier to ""Go Jugging"" at a strange gas station_ begging a gallon at a time and occasionally meeting people who fill your tank_ than it is to remain landlocked into a location that you already know has nothing for you.  It would be cheaper to get a bus ticket somewhere... but that implies knowing a destination beforehand.  You need shelter now_ and a vehicle will provide that shelter.  By and large it will provide the most resistance to the elements_ while being durable enough to withstand the most punishing of weather.  And the point is to get you out of where you are_ and somewhere that is friendlier to you in the immediate.  And... if you are looking at living outside right now as your only option... your immediate landscape is finding better weather.  That requires mobility.  You can walk.  You can bike.  You can hitch (not recommended)_ you can hop (not recommended)... you can drive (eh... yeah_ I'm recommending it)... you can bus or train_ but that's a single expensive push_ that still leaves you exposed to the weather for some duration in the new setting.  By using a vehicle_ you at least have that shell as shelter in the new town/city/state.  UNTIL you can make use of whatever local resources are available there.  Think of it this way... $400 can get you a bus ticket and a short stay at a cheap motel_ or it could get you a vehicle that takes you there and houses you until you get into a shelter or better housing situation.  And potentially get you out of there if things don't work out_ and to another place entirely.  Where do you find these vehicles?  Start with welding shops_ boiler shops_ industrial areas... anywhere that manufactures and delivers locally whatever services they provide.  For example_ a boiler shop bought three HVAC vans at an auction (the HVAC company had gone out of business).  They bought them for the parts on the shelves inside of the vans (fittings_ pipes_ hoses).  Once they emptied the vans (since the parts were worth far more than what they paid for the vans)_ they stored them out behind their shop.  Two of the vans still ran.  One ran well enough to drive down the east coast_ from New England to Florida_ back to New England_ and back down to North Carolina.  For $300.  It might be a bakery that has their own delivery vans_ and they've got one out behind their store that isn't being used anymore.  Or like the printing company in Tallahassee that had a van they weren't using_ because there were entry and exit bullet holes in the windshield (entry) and about a foot behind the driver's head in the left side of the van (exit).  No one was in the van when it was shot.  Or the short bus at the bus maintenance garage in Aberdeen_ WA_ that wasn't being used because of superficial damage to the rear quarter that wasn't cost effective to repair.    It will require leg work to find these... because you are looking for something that some business doesn't care about selling_ which is why it will be so cheap_ and sitting on some property unused.  But this is a common ""thing"" among smaller businesses of these types.  Vehicles get retired and written off that are still usable_ and you taking it off their hands saves them the trouble of transporting it to scrap for the $250.  Which brings up another place to beg for a car... Pick n Pull lots_ auto-graveyards_ car junk yards.  Often_ they will get cars that still run_ and they paid $200-$250 for them... or they got paid to tow them away.  They can also be a source of cheap cars that will give you $500 worth of performance_ likely more.  And... when you get a foothold where you end up_ you can junk it for that same $200-$250 as seed money.  ...  If you already have a car.  Get into it.  Dump what won't fit_ with you living in it.  Get somewhere with better weather.  Scour the area for available resources as you already are well acquainted with doing.  Or Get into the car_ and find a library.  Connect online_ and search nearby states for what resources are available... you can look up local PIT counts for how many homeless shelter beds are available versus the number of homeless in that city/town/county.  Find a place with high bed counts_ or low numbers of homeless closer to the number of available beds_ and there will be shorter wait times to get into shelters_ and likely other programs like transitional housing to keep the local numbers down.  Just remember_ you are fighting against the weather as much as anything else.  Warmer climates during the winter are better than colder_ when homeless.",bongart,Friendfinder2020,9,2,1,8,1024

Instead of hoisting guilt on you_ it is just as likely that their personal guilt will increase. And their health will then reflect that.

Some people experience enough trauma within just a few months of homelessness that will affect them for the rest of their lives. There is a very real chance that homelessness will compound the issues that you already have into an incapacity that is beyond what you have already experienced.

Next thing i would do is try and secure a car for $500-$1000.  this you can use to sleep in etc.  store all your clothes etc.  next_ i would post up near a planet fitness.  first you gotta get a planet fitness membership which is $10 a month.  posting up near a planet fitness you can use this gym to shower whenever you wanna shower and shit and get cleaned up.  other then that dude i would maybe look into building a home in the woods maybe somewhere inbetween the car and the planet fitness and maybe a 711 lol.  in the woods if i were you i would have a fuck ton of peanut butter and i would build a home with fuckin cellophane.  have you ever seen how you can take a like industrial role of cellophane and just wrap that bitch around a tall structure you build with logs or branches or some shit.  its doable.  i have a lot more ideas too homie if you need em,atkrighteous,anono_mr,7,2,3,3,1530

Also see if there are shelters or food banks or a library or any kind of outreach thing in your area that can help you fill out the paperwork for an EBT card. Just having someone there while you fill in all the little boxes and cross your t's and dot your i's really makes a difference.

Apply online right now if you’re able (I was called the next day when I first moved to IL from MI as a very low income disabled person who did have housing and they had me food stamps in days basically). Though I guess you have the issue of needing an address for them to mail the EBT card to. I’m in a different state at the moment but know when I applied for benefits here I was able to mark myself as homeless and use another address so if you have a friend or someone’s address you can use. Or go to a Department of Human Services office in person and see if they can help.   I know shelters and such will often let you use their address or there’s something where you can have your mail held at the post office.   Basically I would try to work out some way to get EBT because IL is one of more generous states there and you could have money to buy food in a matter of days.,Tzipity,alredy_takn,15,1,1,3,1530

Often it’s our own guests so that’s whatever_ they’ve been here before.  But they’ll try to discharge psych patients who are not med compliant and not well enough to be in a shelter environment_ and also_ we are not a facility!  It’s an overnight emergency shelter - we don’t have the capabilities of handling complex physical or mental needs_ and our staff end up as punching bags (literally sometimes) because they’re not nurses_ trained counselors_ etc.  But they will just discharge people without them having a place to go (they also often just say they’re coming to my job even if they don’t tell the patient that’s what they’re putting down).  They will just try to push them out_ too.  This one hospital was trying to discharge a client of mine naked.  Would not give him clothes (he’d soiled them during some episode) and I had to drive over an hour to bring him new clothes.

j4y9vxs,"That's THE worst_ I feel your pain.      My fiance held all my shit hostage when we broke up a handful of times. By ""Held my shit hostage"" I mean EVERYTHING.      A few times all I had was 2 tshirts_ a hoodie_ a pair of socks_ 2 pairs of leggings_ and a ponytail holder. That's it. No place to stay at all_ no food_ no phone (or any way to communicate with ppl)_ No drugs (I was/still am fighting a severe addiction so it was ROUGH going without)_ and NO SHOES.   It rlly was the fucking worst thing ever.       I didn't even have to deal with the cold like you but I did have to deal with nonstop rain & 100 degree temps. My feet stayed wet 24/7 and we're torn to shreds from walking around in only socks for weeks.      It got to the point where I had a really bad infection of some sort on the tops of both of my feet (I imagine from the constant wetness). One of them was so SO bad. My foot - & eventually my leg - started randomly cramping up & giving out when I'd try to walk. I finally got my bike back & I couldn't even ride it.       My feet were sunburned too because at some point I had to get rid of the socks (too many holes). My dad bought me a piat of flip flops & some sweatpants since it was all they had at Walmart on clearance. He only had 11 bucks to his & no place to stay himself.   Thank God for my dad.      The flip flops made it worse though! I got cuts that were so deep/hurt so bad (where the little plastic piece goes between your toes) that i couldn't even stand up for 3 days! I also had to stay in a bedbug infested house & in a tent in the woods where 100s of mesquitos - yes I mean literally hundreds of them - would swarm me  the second I walked near my campsite.       So_ I ended up with bed bug bites that I had scratched huge holes in_ tons of mesquito bites (even on the soles of my feet)_ + many cuts_ scrapes_ & blisters. And a fucking TICK that was in between my toes. I was too lethargic/sick/scared to pull it out so I left it in for 5 days.   My feet literally looked like zombie feet (lol). They sure as hell didn't look like they belonged on anyone who was alive to say the least.   I still have scars & pain from that and it was back in June 2022.

One of my coworkers started talking shit about some of the homeless people that hang out near our building that are outside our door sometimes. Some of them do have obvious drug problems (we see them doing it) but most of them are just like me. I had to work real hard to keep my mouth civil when he started saying something because not only am I living on the brink but *we have coworkers on our team who are homeless right now and have a full time job* because we are in one of the most overpriced and unhelpful cities in the country (Seattle). I skew older (I'm a Xennial) but there are so many fucking people now_ in real life and social media_ who just. Don't. Get it. They don't get how much built in privilege you have to have just to literally not starve nowadays. My father and his wife ruined my finances_ my education_ my social life and I have a host of my own struggles besides; I have barely been able to pick up the pieces_ and I'm *lucky*. These idiots on social media especially_ where there are no consequences for shit spewing to an audience because no one can heckle you - I'm not going to say kids_ because I'm not lumping you in like that_ OP - have reached this point where they are simply so insulated from the realities of the world we live in now in America that those of us that aren't like them are not only invisible_ but we're living proof that their whole reality is founded on lies_ money_ privilege and exploitation and so they hate and fear us.,pnwerewolf,ealb6834,32,4,1,3,1530

They try to find reasons to justify your situation and convince themselves you deserve it because of your own doing.

Others can fade into it from things pulled out of a bottle. That is booze and prescription drugs.  Then they're some whom fall into it from too much debt that becomes overwhelming.   Point is they will always be people who want to b*tch about something. In this case_ it's about homelessness. I can turn on the news sometimes and some city is going to have to vacate_ move and clean out a homeless camp_ folks have set up because the well-to-dos are fussing at Commissioners about it stinking up their property values or whatever.  This is just the way life is these days. You always going to have certain ones griping at others about something.  You just have to grow a thick skin to ignore them and deal with it. Hey_ it works too. It states in the good book_ ""let him without sin cast the first stone_ and don't  judge others lest ye be judged.""  Nobody is better than anyone else! Those that think they're better than you have to put on the same big boy pants you wear. Why you let them anger or tempt you? In reality_ you just might be in better financial shape than their current situation.   Learn to adapt and overcome what bothers you. Learning to control both emotions and thoughts crosses out negativity. Nothing good comes from harnessing bad thoughts and negative actions.  Now my understanding from the Holy book is that Jesus was homeless too! I know what I read out of it says nothing about him having gold and silver with a nice concrete slab mansion on another side of a river.

Speaking from experience - this woman will NOT be satisfied until she destroys you. Being spiritually dead is worse than being physically dead imo and this is what she is doing.   Get your place sorted out as soon as you can_ and crash at family/friends houses in the meantime if you can. But leave that ungrateful *woman* alone.   Then find you a nice woman deserving of your goodness. Stop playing step daddy role as well man. Not trying to be disrespectful.

j4u4xjr,"I'll be honest - pets adjust. That's a hard truth. I have lived with my roommate since August and he has a *very fucked up dog* that we love to death. I am a dog person and since I moved in_ the dog has now become incredibly attached to both of us. 90% of the time_ one or the other of us is home and he is always with one of us - or both. We also have mental health issues (mine are pretty severe) and I don't socialize much anymore_ which adds to the dog attachment. He was alone for 15 minutes the other day between when my roommate left and when I got home from getting some dinner_ and the dog literally crawled into my sweatshirt because he missed me so much (he is a 90 lbs German Shepherd mix; I am a 195lbs 6'3"" man_ but my clothes are only so big).  My roommate does travel sometimes_ though_ and when he is gone_ I have to leave the dog alone during the day while I'm at work. And he is okay. It normally takes him a day to adjust_ but then he learns to self-soothe. And while he is definitely by my side the whole time that I am home (he was very badly abused for the first two years of his life_ and we suspect he may have been involved in dog fighting or something that involved another dog attacking him constantly_ so he gets incredibly attached to people as his caregivers)_ he also learns quickly to cope without having me around all the time. Animals *aren't* people. They aren't. They don't have metacognition_ not really_ they don't think like we do. They get attached to us_ but they don't understand what we *are.* Your cats are the same. They are very attached to you_ but they are more attached to survival. If your cats have a good home to go to_ there will be an adjustment period for them_ but they will survive and thrive_ especially if you trust the person that will foster them and you continue to visit them.   Also_ from the way you have phrased your post_ it sounds like your cats have never actually had to be away from you_ so you don't know how they will react - and because animals don't think like us_ you have to change how you think about their behavior. Our animals don't see us as ""human family."" They see us as companions that are a *way for them to survive.* Dogs are domesticated. Cats are commensal. Domestic cats specifically have evolved to approximately mimic the cry of a human baby to keep your attention in that way and to stimulate that part of the human animal brain. In that way_ they co-opt our own deeply rooted biological behaviors to survive. Your cat wants your attention because it has evolved to want it and you have evolved to prioritize it because of how it sounds. Our pets have also evolved to stimulate the release of oxytocin in our brains_ which is why we look at our pets and go ""omg I have to just SQUISH HIM UNTIL HE BECOMES A PART OF MY BODY HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY"". I do that literally every day. I look at the dog over and over and my brain just goes ""look at this cute thing I need to have it I want to carry it around with me everywhere and take care of it."" He has literally evolved to do that to me. Both dogs and cats also offer humans other benefits besides_ but that is tangential here. Both dogs and cats are programmed biologically to highjack our brains to ensure we care for them_ and cats especially stimulate the parts of human brains that make us care for them kind of like babies. This is also why cats and dogs learn tricks so fast_ including attention seeking tricks - they just know that the more we lavish them with attention_ the longer they will be taken care of and survive. We give in to that normally and reward them for being cute with more attention and love and pets and food_ and the cycle repeats.  But all this happens because our pets are animals and they want to survive.   Like any living thing_ your cats will definitely have an adjustment period. They *will* experience distress because they will be in a new environment where they have to learn how to seek out care and feeding and how to get it_ but assuming your friend who is fostering them similarly likes and cares for cats_ they will adapt. Your friend will need to take care with the avoidant cat_ of course_ but it will come around. The best thing you can do for them is to ensure that they are properly cared for in a way that is similar to how you care for them now_ but you have to trust in the resilience of your animals becuase that is what they are and why we have them around_ too - it's not just to comfort us_ but it demonstrates resilience_ too.   Finally_ and it's important to stress this - pets *aren't* human people. This doesn't mean that they are robots or something_ and they are people_ of a sort but they *aren't* human people. They do not have the same kinds of thoughts and feelings we do and very importantly_ they do not experience trauma in the same way that we do. They definitely *DO* experience trauma_ but they simply don't process it in the way that we do and they don't become traumatized by things the way that we do. As long as your pet is getting its physical needs met - food_ water_ shelter_ medicine_ safety_ etc. - that is paramount_ and they will likely adapt. I know that sounds weird to think about_ but our pets don't lie awake at night wondering about why we suddenly ""don't seem to love them anymore_ as they don't understand that we love them - they only understand that we demonstrate that love through care and physical affection. They *will* fixate on why we stopped feeding them, or if suddenly we react differently to one of their behaviors, but they don't think about it that way. They have an inner life but it is constrained by their limited grasp of the world, which itself is constrained by how their memories work, and they have no proper theory of mind. They *will* miss *you* specifically - but again, as long as you minimize the changes in how they are treated and interacted with, they will do okay.   Don't take your cats with you. Please don't. I have had a few friends fall into that trap out of the belief that it will be too hard on their pet because they will miss me too much"" and every time_ the pet dies. Every. Time. A plan that minimizes the changes to ease the transition would be something along the lines of ensuring that they have the same litter boxes and the same kind of cat litter_ that feeding happens at the same time each day if you do it that way_ that you don't change their cat food_ that they have access to their same kind of toys_ things like that. Ensuring that physical care remains as close to what you give them now is the absolute best thing you can do.",pnwerewolf,pomkombucha,25,14,1,3,1530

I’ve seen warehouses hire same day/next day_ and the pay is decent to where you’ll probably have enough to rent a room (Facebook marketplace has many listings for single rooms for rent_ very affordable and as long as you have a job you’re usually good_ and also very little money down needed).  In the meantime_ a 24/7 gym (planet fitness) membership will secure you showers and bathrooms that are always accessible. It’s might be around $25 a month though. But it’s a nice place to charge devices_ shower_ use the bathroom_ and ofc work out_ but also parking in the parking lot for sleeping as long as you’re discreet. Also_ you can go to public libraries_ fast food restaurants_ gas stations (with seats inside)_ and just relax freely away from the cold/rain and whatever.

j4otb3q,Los Angeles is huge but I'm mostly between downtown and the Westside.  * If you don't have a job_ it's boring. There's only so much to do on your laptop or phone besides apply to jobs and look at feeds. Reading_ writing_ and drawing are essentially free hobbies though. So is walking.  * Fast food is stupidly cheap if you do it right. I can get entire meals for $2. Grocery stores are getting absurdly expensive (except Trader Joe's).   * A car is safety and security. Shelters are not. Shelters may protect you from the elements but they also push into groups of people who are not as mentally stable as you.   * Public transportation is amazingly affordable and convenient. Metro Bike Share is underutilized by most of the population even though it's the best form of transportation in downtown.   * Rent is a leash. I'm saving $25_000/year by not having an apartment. I will actually be able to save up more money than a lot of other people in the city *because* I can't afford an apartment_ and by working half as many hours.  * Nothing helps more than a good friend. They can offer a couch_ a cup of coffee_ a shower_ a floor_ or even just quality time. Distractions are essential_ which is one reason I think alcohol and drug use is so high. We need an escape_ and vices are quick and easy.  * Anyone who has never spent a night on the street has no idea the destruction it does to a person's psyche. It exponentially destroys a person's mental health. If we passed a law that required every person to spend 1 night on the street when they turn 18_ everyone would vote against it as inhumane_ but we don't seem to mind letting the most vulnerable people in society suffer it daily.  * You wouldn't recognize a lot of homeless people because they hide it very well. The obvious ones become the stereotype.,405freeway,averagepyroviewr,1,6,1,3,1530

j4kiw76,I’ve never slept in a car but make sure to note where all public toilets are and public showers.   If you’re a woman (nobody talks about this much!) take whatever tissues_ napkins toilet paper rolls etc you can find for free to use as pads for your period.   I’d say make sure your doors are locked and if you don’t put any valuables in sight most people will not bother you I hope. Blanket’s definitely draw suspicion.   And look for anything you can to for some quick money. Uber eats is a good one I’ve heard_ selling things you can make_ or anything really.   Good luck!

You can also try:   [https://www.211colorado.org/](https://www.211colorado.org/)  I just double checked that because I tried to get some assistance back when things were really bad for me this summer and had to reach out to them. I learned that you can dial 211 from basically any phone_ even your cell_ and it will connect you to a local services line that can then send you on to things like housing_ food and transportation services of all sorts_ depending of course on what is available in your area.   One thing to remember_ dialing 211 will connect you *based on the area code of the phone number from which you are dialing_ not the area code where you are physically located*. My phone number is for Portland_ OR and so it connected me to the Portland 211 number. When I explained my situation_ they then were able to give me the right contact info for the Seattle/King County line. Because you want to get back to San Antonio_ if you have a San Antonio area code_ you could probably dial 211 and get in touch with them directly and they may even be able to connect you with grant programs there to get you home.,pnwerewolf,Groundbreaking-Buy86,12,3,2,3,1530

Though it raises_ its own question.

j4iegxb,Yes_ the school system is based on capitalism. It’s not meant to teach us survival skills or how to thrive in society_ it’s exists to make rich people richer. It teaches kids to be obedient workers and become part of the system. Consumers.   You’d be caught living off the land in Canada though. Even in BC and Ontario/Quebec where there’s land for days they have helicopters doing sweeps. I think you can legally set up camp on crown land for 3 weeks (21 days). I’ve camped that long in the Rockies and didn’t have any trouble from the Rangers that came by to check on things. But if you were to make a go of it for food and shelter (as a lifestyle) you’d get caught. Even in Canada.  You can’t grow anything that quick and hunting would be noticed eventually.

I'm no longer under the illusion that most of the people around me are good-natured_ kind-hearted people.  I learned that if I'm really struggling_ most people would treat me worse than a stray dog.  And it's been liberating for me to come to terms with that_ and know that I have nobody to rely on but myself.  I'll never again wonder if people don't want to help me because I'm a bad person.

j4mlun1,"I think you would feel even better attempting change where you can since God will do his will regardless. What about asking to share something at church and when you get the turn to speak you just say ""I just want to remind everyone that Jesus was a homeless man.""  But then do it every single Sunday. Hobophobia is so wide spread that your church is bound to have some in it's congregations. This would be a good way to elicit small change. Maybe also add proverbs about what you do to the those to the least you do to God. I forget the actual quote but you could say after that ignoring them when they speak to you or discriminating against them in public or as part of your job is no different than doing the same to Jesus himself.  If you made your statement every week it may only enrage the secret hobophobes but it will stick with their children and they will start calling out their parents.",AngelicDevilz,RomeosBlueStar,228,2,5,3,1530
j4f7r93,People are often labeled and judged by appearance. No one gets to know anyone. It is sad really. I was homeless and living on the streets for 2 years in freezing cold temperatures. I remember hiding from a police officer because I thought I’d be arrested for loitering because I was wrapped in a blanket in an empty park. I don’t trust anyone and rely on no one but myself. It took 9 years to get back on my feet and I can truly say that I did it by myself with limited support from so called family and friends. I am not ashamed to cut people off. They were not ashamed to do the same to me so I just return the favor. The feeling is mutual. Do not be angry at doing for yourself. Do not let others selfishness eat at your happiness and peace. Those 9 years were long_ but I stayed grateful and humble and now I take nothing for granted. I am glad that you are back on your feet. You go through the worst trauma to become better and it does make you much better for it. Peace my friend.,gam3r0wn3d_2015,RomeosBlueStar,228,11,1,3,1530

I will never forget people throwing money at me and forgetting about me. I will never forget people caring more about my dog's well-being than mine. I will never forget being trapped with no options by the people in power and the multitudes who support them. It will inform my interaction with everyone from here going forward. It will inform how I process all the information I'm given. It will inform my stance toward the order of things as it exists_ and my support for things which undermine or ultimately destroy that order.  However_ on the flip side_ it will also motivate me to try my damnedest not to be like them. Even though I have very little_ it will motivate me to be more generous_ more helpful to others in need_ and to do what I can to make others feel less alone_ even if they have issues. It motivates me to at least try and swim against that current.,thelink225,RomeosBlueStar,228,11,1,3,1530

j4j6ef9,"I was heartbroken_ crying_ and feeling the emotions while reading OP and this comment.   Same thing happened to me when I lived in my SUV for 341 days (Jan 21_ 2022 - Dec 28_ 2022) after a breakup with an abusive alcoholic broke into someone else's apt while drunk_ resulting in both of us getting evicted (of course he didn't display any red flags before I moved in with him!) and then struggled working for many small businesses that left me stressed out and tired all the time_ gaining weight and hating myself the most for getting so low— even suffering COVID during the summer heat and then being let go from a job because the neurotic female owner was scared of getting COVID herself.   The worse feeling was being neglected by my local church and community group that I attended. The few people who I was completely vulnerable with about my situation were always shocked_ since my suv is a MB_ the previous year I was making good money_ and I always dress well. When it first happened_ I cried to my pastor on what to do or if there are any families able and willing to take me in as I look for work_ but the best he could tell me was to sell my suv_ get into an affordable apt_ and ride the bus. But at the time I was relying on my suv for earning quick money by delivering for UberEats.   I remember having days of joy_ gratitude_ drive_ and motivation... then [more] days of anger_ sadness_ self-pity and self-loathing. Anger at the people who say they believe in being like Jesus_ but then anger at myself that I got to the point of making others so uncomfortable to do so.   Although I haven't attended church since then_ I've kept the faith and im serious when I say only God has been able to provide the miracles that allowed me to get out of that situation and a bad job into a live-in caregiver job. That suv broke down the weekend before Dec 12_ 2022 when was fired from my secretary job at an investment firm because they were uncomfortable with my living situation (I had to be honest with them since they wondered why I was in the office on designated work from home days...) and they chalked it up to me ""not being a cultural fit.""   My anger towards their rejection of me motivated me to really scour Craigslist for room shares which is where I found a ""$0 live-in caregiver"" opportunity that I knew only God could provide. I still did the work by meeting the person in need of care_ and making a good impression to be accepted. The owner of the auto repair shop where my suv went to die (since I didn't have the money for a whole new engine!) felt so bad for me that he freaking bought me a used Honda Odyssey that one of his employees had for sale for $1k.   I share my own personal mini novel because as much as I empathize with the pain of the trauma and stress it is to be homeless: I promised God that I will only get better_ not bitter. That I will not become hard-hearted. That I will show compassion and be vulnerable sharing the truth of my situation because although some people reject me out of their own fear or bias: there are others who are compassionate and generous who will take the initiative to help when they become aware. I'm so grateful to both the fearful/selfish and the loving/giving because it brought me to today.   I remind myself_ ""forgive them_ they know not what they do."" And that this little chip I now have on my shoulder from this last year motivates me to ""live like no one else now (make sacrifices to live well beneath my means)_ so that later on I can live AND GIVE like no one else!""  Some people are sedated by worldly comforts that it's numbed them of empathy and compassion. I still wouldn't wish them to experience homelessness_ especially in isolation. I wish you and everyone here nothing but love and mercy and hope. ❤️‍🩹🥺💛",jessitabonita,RomeosBlueStar,228,4,1,3,1530

j4gido8,In America you are on your own. Everyone else is only looking out for themselves and family. The systems that are in place to help are only there because of Socialist push back. In upstate NY if it's not 32 Degrees or below you are sleeping in a ditch somewhere that night. If it's that cold you are sleeping on the floor of a community center not knowing if you might die once you close your eyes. We are treated as unpersons and you fall into a cycle of chronic homelessness I will always remember this experience and it will help shape the rest of my life when I get back on my feet I will try to be a voice for the unpersons they need it. It is alright not to forgive society because fuck them I am completely on your side_ this experiences show us how people really operate is disgusting and sadly make us sour.,Maleficent_Ad8881,RomeosBlueStar,228,5,1,3,1530
j4hi642,"Being homeless scarred me for life. I was treated like some kind of plague victim and people were straight cruel at times. All the judgemental people I ran into all the ""fake"" people that offered help but never made good on any offers and my family who ditched me when I needed help the most and showed me how they really felt about me. I did run into good people at times but in general_ I won't forget being mistreated and seeing even worse treatment at times done unto others. You are nothing in society if you are homeless and only a tiny percentage of the populous even cares slightly about you. I saw things that I never thought I would ever see and was traumatized by it.  The US government and state governments hate homeless people as well. Seeing all the anti-homeless measures taken by the city to prevent you from even sitting down disgusts me to my core. Instead of improving overall conditions of life for citizens that have trouble providing they would rather just bar us from all kinds of places so they don't have to ""see"" us. Even though I'm not homeless now I'm starting to get a lot of anxiety just from typing up my experiences being homeless. The worst place of all though?

j4hi1wq,Wouldn’t even need to add on the extra months. I’d love nothing more for people to really grasp (because shit I think most of us didn’t grasp it either even as we were watching our situations fall apart) how once you’re homeless it all gets way harder than you’d ever think to turn it around. Like the point to truly help a homeless person and make the biggest difference in life is before they become homeless in the first place. The irony is it would probably be a lot more cost effective and keep people able to be functioning and contributing members of society without all the mental and physical health shit that hits fast and hard once you’re homeless.   I know I knew I was about to become homeless and I foolishly believed it would just take me a few months_ maybe 6_ to get back on my feet. Yeeeah. I had no freaking idea how bad it was going to get or how much everything about homelessness only compounds and keeps you down. It’s really hard if not impossible to put into words and really make someone understand without experiencing it. There’s always people (I see discussions like this all the time over in the poverty finance sub and want to shout “If it’s so easy why are you subscribed here?”) who talk this big game about how anyone can just bootstrap their way out of anything. I wanna ask those people have you tried doing it while disabled? While your teeth are rotting and you can hardly think straight from the pain but can’t afford dental care. When you haven’t had a place to lay head in weeks? When they tell you there’s a six month wait to even get a bed at the local shelter and you’re all out of places to turn? And on and on and on it spirals. Even if you luck into a vaguely decent social service org or your name comes up after freaking years on an affordable housing list there’s so many near impossible hoops you have to jump through even then.   If anything I’m continuously impressed by every success story I ever hear on this sub. It feels downright miraculous that anyone ever makes it back out of homelessness.,Tzipity,RomeosBlueStar,228,7,2,3,1530

Like the ""omg it could happen to me"" threat is neutralized and they can remain safely existing in their personal ""all is fine_ things can go back to normal"" safety bubble since it's not facing the threat of being popped any more.   I sure hope you're not giving them much or any of your time. They turned their back on you when you needed them the most and now think it's all fine and dandy now that you're off the streets?

It was such a mix of feelings…a lot of it resentment at being put in a place where something like that makes me cry.  But I made myself stop_ and change my perspective.

And that made me rise up higher than they could ever be with just some money.  Anyway_ I try to change my perspective a lot_ it really does help.

Hell we aren't even allowed to bathe or drink from rivers and streams because they've either been fenced off_ diverted into pipes_ or polluted by for-profit industries.  Squirrels and deer and other animals still can... they can eat and drink anything they see outdoors_ and can sleep anywhere they want. But not humans. Humans have been purposefully limited/imprisoned in their world.  Considering we are being actively and purposefully limited/imprisoned in our own world_ those who are responsible for our status must provide us with alternative sources of food. If they do not_ then this is tantamount to cruelty or torture.  It's like keeping a hamster locked up in a cage.. or a cat locked up in your house. once you take responsibility for this animal by locking them up and away from their natural food source_ you BECOME RESPONSIBLE for feeding them.

Rather_ the fear of losing housing is used by the wealthy (employers_ landlords_ ect)_ to extract your time and labor.   At the same time_ the homeless are not spared from this oppression. They aren't free to create their own housing_ nor are they free to own a home of their liking. They are forced to survive without shelter_ and they are shamed for it. Society seeks to end their existence_ by depriving them of basic human needs. Survival is an all consuming job that provides no pay check for betterment. Not to mention_ many homeless do have jobs_ but those jobs don't have a livable wage. And yes_ many of those jobs would be considered an actual form of slavery. Ultimately_ the hard work of the homeless is done while being oppressed by cops_ and society at large. Often by vulnerable groups of people (PoC_ disabled_ victims of violence_ elderly_ pregnant individuals_ ect). The suffering and death of the homeless is used to keep housed workers obedient_ lest they endure the same.   We need to get rid of the mentality of ""It could've been worse!"" cause it doesn't do anything to improve our lives. Chuck it out_ and replace it with_ ""It could be better_ cause shit needs to get better.
10bu8u9,,j4kg0f2,The problem is that we live in a society. People have to get very uncomfortable to make the rest of society comfortable, people have to risk their lives to save others. No one can just rest and do nothing at all, we all have to contribute. I wouldn't mind doing stuff but it's just the over high pace of things and the unrealistic expectations workplaces have from their employers. I don't know if there can be a better society or what we have now is the best of all possible worlds. Either way, I hope there would be a right to die for people like us, so we could refuse the social contract.
10bu8u9,,j4naqns,I so relate to u. I would sign up for MAID because I can’t handle most work environments. I definitely don’t want to die but I can’t cope with the way things are set up. I feel like life is mostly a daily nightmare and I’d leave if I could. That would be a relief and tragic but I’ve lived long enough at 45.
10bs50o,j4cyxti,,That's crazy praying that all of you get some shelter from the cold
10bs50o,,j4eyr88,I'm thankful that when I was homeless, I had a spot in a shelter during the time it was cold. Others weren't so lucky- that first Christmas, there was a Christmas Eve church service i attended, and part of it was remembering the homeless that had died in the past year. I don't remember any causes being mentioned, but some may have been due to the weather (hot or cold).  A lot of groups/people did offer cans of Sterno to those sleeping outside (or maybe inside, but without proper heating), and I imagine that helped at least a little
10bs50o,j4c3cbe,,They shut down our tent city just in time for the shit weather.   Freezing  us out. It’s -8 here today.  No shelter from 730 am to 730 pm.  Library’s only open 4 hours.   And my shit is still wet from yesterdays storm.  Fuuuuck

I complained about it and the staff said that’s just what she does and offered me a roll of paper towels. I do think some people are so mentally ill, so damaged, so hurt they purposely make everything dirty. I couldn’t handle poop all over my stuff and bed and I had to go home. Still trying to get out but don’t want to be homeless again.
10bredl,,j4gd53j,God what a nightmare :/ Can't get much worse than poop. Yeah sometimes the end goal is to hurt someone but it's a mental illness issue, people can be really traumatized and angry or it's a compulsion or something.

j49aqeh,A major one that is missed in a lot of packages is medication - things like pain relief_ UTI medications_ antibiotic cremes_ bandaids_ etc. Many of them come in bulk single packs. Depending on your location heat/cold packs (reusable or one-time use_ I use to let people warm up/freeze theirs when I ran a gas station).   Fleece can be okay depending on where you are_ but cheap fleece ones can get really damp and moldy in the wrong climate_ or frustratingly warm in others. Also depends on if they’re going to someone with a camp or are in the open. Someone with a camp or access to temporary housing can maintain blankets that soak water/stay wet longer much easier. I personally prefer to make and use dual sided with a soft wool on one side and a water resistant material on the other. Great because you can have the resistant on the outside if you’re sitting_ or facing down as a buffer from the ground cold/damp if you’re lying. Reinforced stitching and leaving one side unsewn was great because I could use them as a sleeping bag or cover_ stuff it with pillows_ or use it to carry other items. Blankets are always good though_ so don’t let any of that deter you if fleece is where it’s at for you! Just information from my experience.,godddamnit,ghzstbzstzrs,13,3,1,3,1530

j49ggnz,The staff was stealing meds at the shelter I was at too. One guy even stole someone's new bank card when it arrived in the mail_ activated it and helped himself to all of her money. He got caught and she got her money back but it was like REALLY?  They would also steal anything valuable that they could going through the scanners. One woman lost her gold chains. Another had her laptop stolen right in front of her by a guard who took it saying it wasn't allowed. (It was.)   I had mine but I literally locked my bag so they couldn't take it when it went through the scanner and I kept it under my pillow at night_ locked to the bed. Took my backpack with me even to the bathroom.   The director of the first shelter I was at left right after I left. Word has it_ fired. I'm not surprised. That woman would literally take bags of candy that was brought for residents to enjoy at the holidays and stuff them in her big carry all right in front of us. She'd take it all home with her. She'd give us like one piece and abscond with the rest of it she was so cheap.   Meds vanished nearly every day. A lot of the staff that worked there were ex-homeless or were there working while on probation. They paid them so little that they felt the stealing was justifiable.   The food thing_ half rations_ and expired food being given to us_ that was what really bothered me. I am convinced that the now former director was pocketing money meant for the residents food because when I got to the second shelter the food wasn't much better but there was WAY more of it and we were allowed to eat a lot more_ especially at breakfast.   At the first shelter you'd be lucky to get some eggs and one little breakfast sausage OR a little bowl of cereal and maybe a half rotted banana. In the second shelter we got full eggs and 3 sausages_ 2 cereal bowls_ as many pieces of fruit as we wanted_ and there would be waffles or pancakes too a lot of the time.   The first time I saw the breakfast buffet I was like OMG because it was a positive feast compared to what I was used to at the first shelter. Other meals too. You could take 2 meals if you wanted. The food was still rotten for lunch and dinner_ same providers_ but you could just take extra cereal or waffles or whatever and not starve because you couldn't eat lunch or dinner.   They didn't have a clothes closet there because by then we were actually in hotels but I will bet you that back at the actual shelter they were outfitting people not selling off clothes to resellers. I did lose a pair of boots that came in the mail there though. They just up and vanished and never made it into my hands and the mailman did confirm that someone downstairs did receive them.   I was rather ticked but the person on desk duty that day just denied ever having a package for me that day. I had to let it go but I did rather hope she got horrible blisters and those boots made her absolutely miserable. 👅  In my mind you have to be pretty low to steal from homeless people in a shelter. Or to half starve them and give them potentially dangerous food that's out of date and that you have re-tagged as fresh when it's not. To limit old people who need diapers to one or two a day. To steal personal belongings and medications from people who have practically nothing.   It happens though_ all the time.,mtempissmith,Charleswmcc,80,6,2,9,1231

j4sqicb,"As someone who comes from a family that can't understand that their hoarding is what causes them to lead terrible lives_ the answer lies in that they have no concept of what their stuff is actually worth.     They hold onto mountains of formerly expensive furniture and clothing thinking its worth big dollars because that's what they paid for it_ when the reality is that unless that item is new_ in-demand_ and on a store shelf_ its worthless. They hold onto chandeliers_ dresses_ appliances like blenders and toasters_ chairs with a leg missing_ thinking that they are still worth the 300$ something dollars they paid for each of these items when they were new. But once they have to downsize/move_ all of sudden they realize that no one wants to buy their 20 year old prom dress second hand_ or that chair with the broken leg they still own_ as all of these items can be acquired at the local thrift store with better convenience for the buyer and at single digit dollar amounts that pale in comparison to the original purchase price. And when the thrift store tells them that their stuff isn't donatable due to age/damage_ they refuse to believe it_ as that would put them at a near 600$ loss for what they originally paid for these now worthless items.     Their solution? Give it away to ""someone who'll appreciate it"". I.e. dump this problem on someone else so I don't have to pay for a dumpster. As according to them_ ""this stuff is still worth at least half of what I paid for it. Look at it_ its practically still new!"" As they show you that 20 year old prom dress with the stains on it. Unable to comprehend that not even the homeless are going to want to lug around a stained_ or even new prom dress formerly worth 300$ (Because what would you even do with it if your homeless? You can't even attend interviews in it_ and it'll get ruined at the bottom of your pack. Its dead weight at that point for a population that mainly lives mobile).      Not to mention even new things of value_ like a car engines and fine oak dressers that they think are of value to the homeless to sell_ are also worthless to donate_ as no homeless person even has a place to store these things until they find a buyer_ so what is it to them other than more dead weight? (Especially when it comes to things like old couches and furniture. Yes_ your sofa only has a small tear on it and is perfectly good_ but whose going to buy and old couch from the 90's off your for 100$ when Ikea will sell you one new for 200$ minus the hassle of bartering? Hell_ how's a homeless person supposed to sell a couch?)   And so the charity center then begrudgingly either takes their offer or tosses it for them. The hoarder/Donater then walks away feeling stellar with themselves as they've given away what they view as a 1000$ dollar deal for free to their local homeless_ who can obviously make fantastic use out of it. When then reality is not even the homeless want your old suit with a missing collar piece or old wedding dress with wine sunk into it_ as although these items are expensive to acquire_ for what it will cost to restore them (150$ something dollar alterations)_ nobody shopping at the local homeless shelter could ever afford to_ or has the resources to re-store/repair them.

If you're reasonably prudent about your personal safety (i.e. not passing out drunk in an alleyway)_ most people aren't going to want to start a physical altercation just to steal your pack.  Another solution is to do what a normal_ housed person might do: get a safety deposit box.

As you are in your car 90% of the day_ you aren't out interacting with other homeless people... you are instead in your car.  >I avoid people who are obviously dangerous or potentially threatening.  This makes up the leading edge of the homeless ""bubble"" in your area.  If you drive around_ and try to spot and notice all the homeless people... and you were able to keep an accurate count... you'd find that you are seeing about 1/4th to 1/5th of the total number of homeless people in that area.  The vast majority of homeless people stay out of the public eye_ or don't \*appear\* to be homeless.  It is a **minority** of the total number of homeless who are mentally ill or substance abusers_ and it is a minority of the total number of homeless who are dangerous or potentially threatening.  HOWEVER... if you are **only** talking about the homeless who regularly put themselves in positions of interacting with the general homed population... that 1/4th or 1/5th you see on the streets... then_ the number of predators_ dangerous individuals_ mentally ill and substances abusers becomes a majority.  Just to throw numbers at this.  If there's 1000 homeless in an area_ you'd probably see 200 of them around town in public (or public-ish) areas.  The other 800 would have their particular way of not being seen_ or not being seen as one of the homeless.  If 125 of those 200 were dangerous_ or substance abusers_ or mentally ill...  that would certainly give the impression that **most** of the homeless in that area were dangerous_ or substance abusers_ or mentally ill... even though it is an impression created by only 125 people out of 1000.  Yes_ it would be hypocritical if you were to avoid homeless people_ when you yourself were very aware of how people avoid you due to your homeless status.  However_ you aren't letting cold homeless people into your car to warm up either.  And... are you actually avoiding being this interactive in your homeless community because you are avoiding ""homeless"" people?  I don't think so.  And that's why I don't believe you are being a hypocrite.  You aren't avoiding people **because** they are homeless... you are avoiding predatory and dangerous people_ who also happen to be homeless.  And they just happen to be homeless... since the pool of people you have to choose from that you can be social with_ is limited by your own homeless status.  If everyone around you is covered in mud_ you can't blame being covered in mud for why one of them screws you over.  I'm not saying you are.

Switch to consistently telling em you have no plan_ and actively enjoy thinking about the possibilities in your future. It helps to smile a bunch and pretend to get along with the other patients.

There’s too many of us with stories like this. And if your abusive situation isn’t clear cut (like a spouse or partner versus other people in your life- think I saw from one of your comments that your situation was more complex. Mine too) or you’re already out of it you tend not qualify for any of domestic violence shelters or assistance.   Soul crushing is the perfect word for it and I get even more upset hearing other peoples stories and knowing I’m not unique in this.   I’m not the best at chatting up strangers but legit if you need to vent or want to chat hit me up. And either way- I hope you keep fighting and have some better luck soon. I know I am often flip-flopping between thinking “Damn it_ I fought hard and this long so I’m not giving up now” and just drowning in my despair and hopelessness.

j3wl0dh,736 homeless died in Phoenix Arizona in 2022. That number doesn’t include the 450 that were not categorized correctly. I was homeless in June and July here and had to stay at a shelter. There are so many programs for the homeless here but you have to follow rules or you get kicked out. It’s impossible for addicts to follow the rules so live in The Zone in tents and die from overdoses of fentanyl_ dehydration etc. It was horrible and scary in the shelter. I was sexually assaulted in my sleep by another woman. That wasn’t bad enough for her to get kicked out though. Our state makes billions of tax dollars off marijuana sales and I would like to see some of it help the addicts get into a safe place. Fentanyl abuse is so rampant here they even smoke it on train and bus. Most bud stops are just drug dens. It’s impossible to avoid in the areas of town with shelters.

j3u752e,As with any program that targets disabled_ it will depend upon personal finances_ resources_ and what the state/federal guidelines are. Simply being disabled doesn't mean you automatically get anything. The major difference between disabled and able bodied_ for me_ was that my state gives me a longer period of receiving food stamps without needing to reapply as often. I still have to report any income changes_ including rent changes. I still have to re-apply by my renewal date. I still can be denied for food stamps. I just don't have to re-apply every three months_ just once a year.  Other programs_ unless specifically for disabled or elderly_ are going to be just as likely to have program restrictions that may be only slightly looser than for able bodied. In fact_ some can be MORE restrictive for disabled/elderly_ because you may gain in one area_ but then lose in another. I gained 8.7% for a cost of living increase. That put me too high to continue to get free health care. Now_ I'll likely easily eat away the extra money by needing to pay co-pays and deductibles. I would have preferred to not have that extra 8.7%_ because my medical issues can cost me more in the long term.,unwillingvictim,ianzki23,5,3,1,3,1530

j3yj1xy,It’s awesome you’re working on what you are. My parents are much older than the norm (they were 46 and 51 when they had me!) so at this point they’re basically in their 80s and not doing well but even before that point weren’t supportive.   Really interesting point about the institutionalization thing. Because in many ways the reason I’m homeless was my refusal to go to a nursing home. My favorite part was a doctor who insisted I could not possibly continue to receive the life sustaining treatments while homeless. So she painted nursing home as the only option. Well_ she was wrong. I’m getting that treatment. But it also means I can’t stay in a regular shelter. It’s absolute rock and a hard place.   I also hopped states in this mess and am the top of the list suddenly for a supportive housing unit for disabled and homeless folks in the state im not currently in and they’re pushing me to get over there and sign paperwork and I’m not even sure I can and it’s all just ugggggggh. And I have long lived with that terror that if you don’t have family to care for you_ there really isn’t anything else. So part of me realizes even if I finally find my way out of the mess I’m in now that fear will never leave. I’ll always be half a step away from exactly what’s happened now.   Anyway. Totally rambling. It’s been so freaking hard though because it’s like what little disability assistance does exist or the options for homeless folks in general don’t really work for my needs. So I’m treading and spinning circles getting nowhere. It’s really gross that societally we’re happy to throw the most vulnerable amongst us to the wolves basically.,Tzipity,InfiniteClient4631,32,1,3,3,1530
j4f49ik,Appreciate it. It's definitely a struggle. The biggest thing that the accessible housing development comes down to is cost_ and that's hard to get around without more federal funding. That and time. It took us decades to get into this housing crisis (even before we were building with disabled folks in mind) and it will take us decades to get out of it most likely. I'm sorry to hear about your parents. Between them not doing well and not being supportive is tough. I'm very glad and fortunate my parents have been nothing but supportive.  Yes_ exactly! No young person with a disability wants to have to live in a nursing home. Not being ageist_ but being segregated from peers your age is devastating. It's one thing if it's multigenerational (which I think it should be_ because siloing away our elders is also bullshit)_ but if you're literally the only person below retirement age (or younger) that must be so isolating.  How come you can't stay in a shelter while doing this treatment? Or is it just not accessible enough?  I like the concept of universal design - that is_ making spaces usable to greatest extent possible by the most number of people as possible. I think we should apply this philosophy to all buildings so that we don't have to retroactively make shit accessible. Just do it from the beginning. It may be more expensive upfront_ but in the long run it will save time_ money_ and resources. To your point about being thrown to the wolves_ we don't do this because as a market society we're too focused on short term profits and gains. We used to make buildings that were built to last and carefully crafted to fit their community. Form followed function. Anyway_ thanks for coming to my TED Talk lol.  Ah I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through right now. I hope you can figure out something soon. I wish I could help somehow.

j3uaoig,If you have a therapist_ talk to them about getting Prissy documented as your ESA (Emotional Support Animal). ESA's can be any type of cat_ unlike the dogs and mini horses that are considered true support animals. ESA's have the same housing rights_ although hotels and motels are not required to allow them to stay. But you can't be denied housing due to an ESA_ and ESA's can't be charged as pets (no pet deposits_ no pet rent_ but you can be held responsible for any damage_ if caused by the ESA). They are considered medical equipment_ but don't have public access (can be denied entry into public buildings like theatres_ restaurants_ stores_ etc).  If you can get her documented_ then it makes it much easier to get her into an apartment. There are four exceptions to ESA housing_ but it's the same as for those with service animals as well. Your primary care doctor may agree to document her_ but therapists are preferred_ since they are EMOTIONAL support_ rather than physical support. Just talk to the therapist_ and explain how much better your quality of life is since you got her. My therapist saw that_ even without me directly talking about it_ and offered to document my cat before I could ask. The paperwork should just need to be on the doctors letterhead_ with the confirmation that you have a cat ESA_ and have the doctors contact information provided. It should be dated_ and my apartments have accepted it as long as it was less than a year old. They shouldn't need a new document for the time you stay at the apartment/house.,unwillingvictim,InfiniteClient4631,32,7,1,3,1530

Your grandma has a mental illness that is making her hoard.

j3ux95l,I'm sorry that your brother and dad are treating you unfairly. I used to be a case manager_ and I can try to help you look up resources. I have a few questions:  1) Do you mind sharing your age? There might be shelters in your area for homeless youth. Where I live_ these shelters accept people between the ages of 18-25.    2) Are you attending some school or educational program? This could be K-12_ community college_ university_ or technical programs. Your school might offer special services or grants to support you.     3) Do you have any friends that you can stay with for the time being? Even if they don't have room right now_ maybe they could offer you a safe place to park overnight? I'm glad that your boyfriend is offering to let you shower_ laundry_ etc. at his place_ even if you can't live with him for now.     4) Do you have any nearby relatives that can help you? I saved this for last because it could be tricky depending on their relationships with your dad and/or brother.  It might be helpful to ask if you can stay with a friend or a relative for a specific amount of time (like 2 weeks_ 2 months_ etc) until you can find a job and a place to live.  5) There might be a resource hotline in your county or state that provides referrals to community programs_ like shelters for homeless people_ domestic violence survivors_ LGBT_ etc. Even if these shelters don't have space right now_ they might be able to offer cash assistance or motel vouchers so you can stay in a motel for a couple nights for free.   I'm sorry again for what you're going through. You deserve to be treated with respect by your brother. Regardless of you and your brother's age_ your father is still your parent and should act like one in difficult situations like this. I'm taking a guess that your dad is passive or tends to bend to your brother's will_ which is unacceptable. Especially when it gets to this point where you're leaving your house... He defend your brother_ but you are also his child and worthy of respect and healthy boundaries.   To end on a positive note_ I am happy to hear that your boyfriend is trying his best to be supportive. His parents might not let you live with them now_ but they might change their mind in the future. I'm glad that you are trying to better your life and leave your toxic home environment. Not everyone has the courage and support to leave a negative situation. Best of luck_ and my DMs are open.  *Quick update*: Sorry_ I misread your post and thought you had a car. I think it might be more urgent to call the resource line or domestic violence shelters near you. I'm guessing from your avatar that you may be a woman (my apologies if I'm incorrect). Many DV shelters accept women_ and some accept people of all genders (but unfortunately_ it's not as common). I recommend DV shelters because you might be moved to a small house or apartment complex_ instead of a general homeless shelter than could be more dangerous and filled with more people. I think this is an emergency_ so I really hope the shelter hotline can find a bed for you tonight - honestly_ I think they might give you a motel voucher because most shelters are impacted (at full capacity).,ribbitfrog,LeaChan,22,1,1,3,1530

j3s0z6g,Any coast has major storms and even the middle of the country isn't immune. My Mom's family my great grandfather built a big farmhouse in Kansas City and it stood for nearly a hundred years but one bad tornado and it was history.   The tornado literally flattened the house and everything in it was gone. The only reason my Grandmother on that side survived was because she went into the cellar.   Everything was smashed except oddly this porcelain egg that was kind of a family heirloom. I still have that now even though a tree fell on my house and destroyed it. It's remarkable that it's made it through two natural disasters that egg.   Mama Nature can get you wherever you live. If it's not storms then it's earthquakes or floods or fires or volcanos. Nobody is ever completely  safe from a potential natural disaster really.   One guy I knew he bought a house with his wife and it turned out the house was built on a huge snake nest. All Winter they were fine_ just digging their new house but come Spring they had freaking snakes everywhere_ including a bunch of cooperheads.   They had to move out and they sued the former owner for non disclosure. 250K house and they couldn't live in it without it crawling with snakes when it was warm.   Stuff happens. It's just life. Look at what's happening out in California right now. Even rich people like Oprah are having to vacate their homes because of major flooding. A few months ago it was forest fires.

That said_ as a (well_ homeless) woman myself_ I kinda see that he might have just been awkward with what he asked you and meant no harm_ but living how I do_ I've met/know plenty of homeless_ and sadly a lot of them panhandle due to drugs but aren't above doing whatever to get money_ I really wish people weren't so stereotypical as I myself only panhandle_ I ask for shit I don't take.   You've done your part_ you need to take care of yourselves_ I think if you can find a tactful way to either ask him to leave or have someone else do it that would be best.

j4asv1p,I’m sorry_ but you are being way too nice_ and this man is clearly taking advantage and getting off on your naivety_ and testing how far he can push you.  You shouldn’t have gotten him a coffee after he did that_ there is no excuse— if he’s savvy enough to know to be polite then slowly start asking questions about your home and parents_ he’s not insane_ he’s a fucking danger.  I get that it might feel bad at first_ but you’re very young and should know this: sometimes as a woman you have to be a bitch to get your point across to someone who is taking advantage. And if you can’t be assertive here_ you need to get a big/ strong/ tall/ intimidating male friend or family member to physically demand that he leaves and never comes back.   You aren’t his guardian Angel_ and he clearly doesn’t give a shit about you or your sense of safety or dignity. Stand up for yourself and realize he isn’t a lost kitten_ he’s a manipulative pervert who happens to be experiencing homelessness.   And mind you I am only talking about this specific man—I think in general it is great to be kind_ but you have to know to set boundaries when people show you who they are.

Cops may not be able to do much the first time_ but after if you have to call again it will be on record and he won't be able to bypass trespassing twice.   If you get lucky he may even have warrants.   This guy sounds dangerous. All your doing now is pissing him off.,AngelicDevilz,clockthecasba,83,3,1,3,1530

And if the intruder doesnt have a gun themselves_ usually they'll run at the first sight of one. Except they cant run cause you'll have a big ass dog 😆  As far as your neighborhood_ 99% of people outside will leave you alone and would greatly appreciate your assistance_ but if you're worried about the 1% (and I dont mean that sarcastically) then I would invest in some mace and/or a CCW. If the one guy in particular is bothering you_ just be direct without being disrespectful and ask him nicely to  go to a shelter. You could even offer to take him there. But I would say its not safe to let a stranger who's asking invasive questions and knows all of your schedules to stay literally at your back porch. Plus 3/4 of you are women? Yeah nah fuck that.

j3orulx,> today he asked if we had any dogs in the house (we don’t) and he said “What_ no guardians?”.  Oh_ jeez...  I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt here and assume this guy is just clueless when it comes to interacting with people. So I'd probably try use that as a way to start a longer conversation with him. Like_ walk by his camp with at least one of your other roommates and try to catch his attention_ then bring it up and tell him how saying things like that comes across to a young woman. After that_ keep the conversation going and really try to figure out what kind of person he is. He may be a very good guy_ in which case it can be a benefit to have him staying there if your place is a thoroughfare. That may even be what he was hoping to say with the guardian comment_ however badly it came out.  If you keep getting bad vibes_ though_ then you just have to ask him to leave. Personally_ I never call the cops under any circumstances_ but I get it if you feel you need to. But maybe consider going down as a group (all four of you that live there) and asking him about it. Try to think of this as mutual support for each other_ not a way to intimidate him. And try to remember that no one's all bad (or all good)_ we're just complicated.  Good luck and stay safe.

I think you and your roommates should nicely talk to him of his intentions. Then I think you should tell him almost exactly what you shared here.  That it's sorta a pass through spot. And that they like it that way_ so they can help others as well. but I would be honest and tell him it's about time to start thinking about moving on.  If you get a lot of kickback. Then I would mention how his comment about guardians has everyone uneasy_ that your not assuming anything but ask him to put himself in ur shoes. Lots of homeless are really empathic_ good_ kind_ accepting people.  I think that's how some of them simply survive by being agreeable.  Lots of opinions_ and their like assholes.

j3j06mj,Agreed. Also_ this might sound fluffy and silly but it isn’t: People need connection and friendship. Unsheltered people_ especially those who have substance use disorders_ have burnt many if not all of their bridges_ and surviving on the street is hard_ there are not many people who are out to help or who won’t harm them even. So striking up a real_ non transactional friendship with somebody can help you discover how to really help that person. Of course_ you can’t do that with every person you encounter on the street_ but certainly with one or two. Try it!  I’ve done this through my work in this field and have found it such a beautiful learning experience.,princesalacruel,Ill_Impress_1570,19,4,1,3,1530
j3ht14m,I'n not discouraging you from doing something more_ by all means_ any help is beneficial_ but imo if you want a personal touch_ talk to them. Have an actual conversation. Ask them what they need. Pick the amount of money you're giving them based on what they tell you.      If they say they need $100 to make it through to the end of the month_ and you then give them that $100 (or more if you're feeling generous)_ it doesn't get much more personal than that. You're likely to make someone cry of happiness_ depending on how hard their situation is at the time. You may literally be saving their life.,Soulegion,Ill_Impress_1570,19,9,2,3,1530

j3kduf6,Yeah. Even if I ever got anything like $20 or more the majority wasn't going to substances at all. Of course I'm nowhere near where others are in terms of drugs or alcohol. $5 is a gram of weed or a tall can of alcohol. $15 is food and whatever immediate item I need the most. Socks_ lighter_ clothing from the thrift store_ toiletries_ coffee so I can sit inside when it rains. I'd never blow $20 just to get high if somebody gave that to me. It's a waste and it's short lived. If I really want to party I'll go do some temp labor and even then I'm not spending all my money on garbage.

Their disregard for keeping the community clean is just as irksome to other homeless people as it is to everyone else_ but the problem gets blamed on ""the homeless"". Even illegal dumping from housed people gets lumped in with ""the homeless.""  I guarantee_ nobody in that tent encampment has a blue velvet couch or a bunch of used sheetrock.

Also? Not every homeless person is a drug addict. There are plenty of people in houses throwing their drug-relates trash and needles out in inappropriate places_ too.

After Jean Valjean robs the bishop of all of his silverware_ is captured by the police_ and is returned to face the bishop_ Myriel understands completely that theft is merely a means of survival for those who have nothing.

j3jvedn,You have to remember that religion is a big motivator for people to aid homeless people.  As much as people think of the church as a bunch of hypocrites_ the data shows that many religious people do care about the homeless and strive to be compassionate and help in an individual level.  Maybe not money but in other ways. You’ll see churches provide alot of services too. However I’d be willing to bet many of the college kids that help homeless are either liberal or don’t know anything at all about politics. In fact_ I can’t help but feel politics doesn’t play in to the decision too much when a person is face to face with someone suffering. I’d like to think for the most part_ it’s the person’s character that would weigh more than politics.,Fit-Success-3006,veryberryblue,43,3,2,3,1530

j3g00ac,Any truck stop (not gas stations) especially chains will most of the time have showers. Just walk it and tell them you would like to purchase a shower. Once you've paid for the shower_ they will give you a ticket with a number that tells you when it is ready.   It's usually around 12 to 15 dollars_ the truck stop I worked at included soap_ a towel_ and a wash rag. You got a spacious warm private bathroom with a sink_ shower_ and toilet. I don't remember us timing anyone so you could shower and relax.   I don't remember if the one with the bathtub was extra or not_ I doubt it was extra. We would clean and sanitize after every person as truckers expect them to be spotless for what they're paying (showers are free for truckers if they get a certain amount of diesel but still.)  The only bad thing about truck stop showering is sometimes they can be a royal pain in the ass to get to and from one with how they're usually on a highway. Though they often need help and you could probably get a job at one and shower at the next closest one and they're usually relatively close to one another.  You could try googling *truck stop shower nearby* and call them and ask if they have showers at the location before making the trip out there. Maybe there is one closer than you realized.

I don’t know why_ but it bothers me when a term like “criminal” is used as a stand in for bad or dangerous person.

They hung out off and on for a week til I moved my camp because I don't like anyone knowing where I sleep outside.   Another time I tried to treat a methhead like a human being and they tried to rob me at knifepoint I had to pull a Dundee maneuver with my 15-inch kukri and he luckily wasn't desperate enough to want to take it any further and left me in peace.   I know everyone's experiences are different but I've only met a couple shitty power-hungry cops in all my travels.

j3gds5o,I have done what you're doing now. A couple of pointers_ if you don't mind. Perhaps they're redundant_ but I'll throw them out there_ in case something can help. Always have at least two sources of light. You can get a decent flashlight from Walmart for 99 cents. Always_always_always have some fresh water. You cannot have too many socks. Never_ ever set your campsite near the road. Move back into the woods a good ways to a fairly isolated spot. This will help protect you from both thieves and cops. Make sure to note landmarks_ so you can find your way back to your camp. (This is Critical!) Never leave anything in your camp that you can't afford to lose. Pack out all electronics_ all documentation_ and a change of clothes every single time you leave. Go to the local Social Services_ or apply on line for EBT/SNAP benefits. This will guarantee a food supply regardless of actual money. Don't trash your campsite. Haul out your garbage each day when you head out. This may sound vanilla_ but trashy disgusting littered sites do a lot to foster prejudice against the homeless. Be the exception_ not the stereotype.  In wintertime_ (like_ now) set up your sleeping bag so it is above the ground. This can be done with bowers_ an air mattress_ (pain in the ass. You need a pump to inflate it. But_ still worth it.) or pallets (the most efficient and economic.) The winter ground will suck the heat out of you faster than anything but freezing water. Avoid direct contact if possible. Keep enough money saved to replace your tent_ sleeping bags_ and some clothes in case you get robbed. As you wander_ always scope out alternate places to set up camp. Take the time when you can to explore them. Keep a mental list of places you could relocate to if needed. Trust your instincts. If things seem off somehow_ if people are getting too close to your camp_ or if things nearby are getting hairy_ don't hesitate to move. We have a natural territoriality that you must resist. You have no territory. The world is your home. You must camp where the tranquility is_ and avoid conflict. Move when necessary_ and do  not delay. Your life does actually depend on it.  Don't tell anyone you're homeless. Other than social workers. Homelessness instantly changes the way people view you. And not in good way. Is it fair_ or just? No. But it is the reality of your situation_ and you must accept it_ or suffer.  Did I mention fresh water? And socks? Anyway_ I hope this didn't seem preachy or pedantic. Just trying to help. Good luck to you. I hope everything works out well in the end. Feel free to pm me if needed.,xX_Ogre_Xx,magellan1522,19,3,1,9,1231

j3gaie9,I keep a backpack primed and ready after I aged out of foster care and had to figure out on my own how to make it.   I spent my 20s traveling the USA as a nomad. It was terrifyingly enlightening_ and then I learned what tools make life simpler.   Anymore I work off and on as necessary only to pay for the luxuries i want. I spent so much time outside it's like a second home. Being homeless is more an inconvenience than a terrifying situation anymore. Working hard doesn't get you again anymore sadly.   In the right places_ you can live pretty comfortably outdoors once you get used to not having all the luxury of constant electricity_ running water_ and a toilet.   I recommend scouting out a few places no less than 100 yards from anything else. Keep an eye out for branches that could fall on you. If there is any trash or anything it's a no go. People go there.   Get you a Silcock key_ it will give you access to water spigots on the outside of businesses so you can rinse off and get hose-quality water to fill your water bottle. Make sure to relock and tightly shut back off so you're not drawing unnecessary attention.    3 or more ways to make fire. BIC lighter_ tiki torch_ denatured alcohol_ practice how to make a Dakota fire hole_ fire starters_ matches_ fatwood. when it gets down to deadly Temps your fingers don't work right and the fire seems to refuse to take on a life of it's own.   Clear plastic drop cloth works better to cover a shelter better than a tarp it keep water from dripping thru. Emergency blanket-styled sleeping bag. 3 feet or more of leaves is needed for insulation.  I prefer to make a primitive shelter and then dig a fox hold under it with a pocket in a corners filled with small rocks for any water that runs in to collect. It takes time but tossing rocks on fhe bottom keeps things cleaner as you don't have to worry about mud so much. The dirt I get from the hole goes on top mixed with leaves to add insulation and make it look like a rough hill. I've carved a bench/chair and a mini fireplace.  Hygiene is a huge deal_ it can cost you your job and your life. Keep a gallon jug of water for washing off. A cheap bar of laundry soap is useful for keeping clothes clean in a stream so you don't have to lug clothes to the laundry mat and spend money there. Clean boxers and socks shouldn't be a luxury. Wash your hands and face every chance you get. It's surprising how quickly dirt can collect and make you look dirty. Baby wipes are wonderful for this.   Dumpster diving is a way to get meat in colder months.   You can bury a ice chest so when the lid is placed the chest is just below flush with the ground with dirt on top. Fill with ice regularly and you can keep some food and not have to live on less desirable food.   With some rope and a bag you can fill it and submerge it 3 feet or more into a a body of water and it will keep meat and milk good for days. Cereal is something I enjoy sometimes and where there's a will there's a way.   I know loads of tricks to make living outside very comfortable if anyone has specific questions feel free to ask.   Temp agencies are a life saver as well. They can offer day labor without the sketchiness. So you can make some cash.   I will say don't get busted digging on_ or sleep in a hole on someone else's land. It will get you arrested. It's just how I was able to make it places that got minus double digits in the winter and moderately high crime rates.,kaosmoker,magellan1522,19,3,1,12,1488

This generally means cleaning up after yourself and other people and giving people a lot of space when they aren’t in the mood to interact or talk.  It’s still a really rough feeling living and feeling like that.

j3b5uzc,It’s true_ keep the place clean. Always clean up after yourself but if you go the extra mile by cleaning after the host_ vacuuming_ scrubbing the toilets basically make yourself a live in maid then you won’t burden them.

It’s good for the host to think that they are helping u but if you are not being proactive about working or trying to get off their sofa then it could really hurt your friendship. I have let 3 people stay on my sofa and 1 was great_ 1 was terrible nightmare and the other is currently staying with me now…she’s okay… I’m happy to help her out but she sleeps in every day_ works only a few hours but cleans after herself. A lot of her income goes to her car so if she doesn’t step up to full time idk if she will be on my sofa a year from now… I want her to want to get on her own feet…  which I’m sure your host wishes for u,bat2ghost,Suspicious_Sound_854,12,14,1,3,1530
j3ax5au,"heya. i'm sorry you're going through this shit rn.  For the address: In my experience_ some shelters will offer to take your mail so you can go pick it up there. When i was homeless and looking for jobs_ I used either the shelter's address on my resume or an old address if i was worried they'd look up the address and see that it was a shelter. i've never had any prospective employer mail me anything but_ well. if i were you_ i would call around to some places in your area to see if they offer the mail thing if that's what you need it for.  As for the safe place to sleep: that's really dependent on your area and i'm hesitant to tell you exactly where to go. i would start out by calling shelters right when they open and asking if they have spaces. you could knock out seeing if they do mail_ too. there is [211.org](https://211.org) for seeing what's around you. i always got really frustrated trying to navigate the front page for some reason_ so you might be better off just googling ""211 homeless resources"". it's true that not all shelters are created alike_ but it could be worth a shot_ at least just to see what's around you and what you've got to work with.  During the day i hung out in either the library at the community college or in panera with their ultimate sip club thing. gave me space to think_ which was what i really needed.  some of these places will also help you get hooked up with things like a social security card_ medicaid_ food stamps_ etc if you need any of that. i guess i'm mostly just passing the advice i was given to you... I know there aren't really any ""good"" options here_ but i'm glad you're trying to survive this.",MeanwhileOnPluto,Suspicious_Sound_854,12,4,1,3,1530

j3bp63i,"I've had a couple of surgeries while homeless_ and while it definitely isn't fun_ there are options out there for you.  Like other folks have said_ you're gonna wanna ask the hospital you'd be having surgery at to talk with a social worker or patient advocate_ in order to formulate a discharge plan that will ensure you're going to be able to take care of yourself afterwards_ and get to any follow-up appointments.   I will say this though - when I see people sat that they've been told they need back surgery_ I always suggest that they get a second opinion_ and avoid any surgical centers that are run by your doctor for procedures like this_ or places like the incredibly shady spinal surgery centers that used to have commercials all over advertising their ""free"" MRI reviews. The vast majority of the procedures pushed by places like that? Are completely unnecessary_ with incredibly low rates of success_ and if you'd like some brand new nightmare fuel to keep you up at night? Check out failed back surgery syndrome.   I'd also be making real sure that everything will actually be covered. Just because you have Medicaid? Doesn't mean it will be_ and you're gonna want to confirm that with that actual billing department of where you'd be having this procedure. Anyone else? Isn't qualified to tell you what is and what is not covered_ nor whether you'd have co-pays_ or other limitations on care.  ***I'll add that any reputable doctor who was trying to schedule a much-needed back surgery for a homeless patient would be working with you to help make sure you have a discharge plan afterwards that includes a place to recover and the ability to get back and forth to follow-up appointments. If they don't make an effort to try and help you out with that? Then they're not really concerned with your health and well-being_ so much as they are with scheduling a procedure they can profit off of_ and therefore not the doctor for you.",Complaint-Expensive,hunkachunkapbfudg,34,2,1,3,1530

j346ckc,I'm an introvert who has learned to act like an extrovert sometimes but panhandling I was just never able to bring myself to do it. It just felt so wrong for me. So I just found other ways to make a little money while homeless.  I would offer to help clean up at pizza shops for pizza slices or make earrings to sell off a blanket. A couple of times I made some art prints and sold those in the parks because it's allowed here sans permit_ unlike jewelry which sold in the wrong place could get me busted.  I also flipped a few things I found thrifting online once I was in a shelter and had an address. I even tried to do one of those tee platform stores_ Red Bubble. I made a few bucks that way but never that much. By and large though I found if I was offering something tangible some people would buy it and help me out and I could avoid panhandling entirely.  I came out of a background in retail management and sales. So selling to me came a lot easier than just asking people for money. I actually don't like direct sales very much even if I am good at it and I'm a crafty type so I mostly just made stuff and put it out there and dickered if need be.  Just sitting on a tourist pier or on a blanket in a major park making crafty things usually had people coming over to see what I was doing out of sheer curiosity. Most days I'd sell enough for quick dinner at least.  If people offered me money I took it and thanked them but I never actually went over to them and solicited it.

j38dmsv,I have been living in my car for about a year by choice. Just make sure you have income and are able to stay warm and have dry cloths and you will be ok. Always have a plan and work on it every day. And remember to take care of yourself mentally and physically. So take a break_ eat healthy and ya know. Look for a good laundry mat and get a gym membership if you have income. Hotels are really expensive so only get one in a emergency. There are lots of van life and car life videos on YouTube that can give you some tips. But if your goal is to get a place I would focus on your credit score and save up money. Don't trust anyone you meet on the street. Even if they seems nice they may rob you of everything.,FederalDatabase178,loveramloser,48,1,1,3,1530

j34p6s5,If I’m understanding you correctly you are able to essentially visit friends and round robin . I in the past have left a containers/crates/backpacks at friends places_ that way everywhere i stay has necessities clothes/hygiene/chargers. That way if friend A had something come up then its still ok.   I would recommend not taking tattered-clothes or stuff you dont wear (for whatever reason) that stuff takes up space and mental bandwidth.  Be practical but also don’t ignore sentimental items. Allow yourself to keep a few items that maybe mean something to you_ having that stuff sometimes helps when things are difficult.  Depending on where you live there might be resources for homeless people.,ashen_raye,Specialist-Ad634,14,2,1,8,1024
j2ylux6,Where do you live? Are you anywhere near a national park? If so_ buy a cheap tent and find a good place to post up. The law is technically like 15 days is the limit_ but A.) Rangers don't usually bother reinforcing it_ and B.) If they do_ the law says you can literally move your tent to a new spot and the 15 days starts over. But you won't have to. Just bring books or go use public wifi to download shows_ because it will get boring. Get a portable charger for your phone_ they're not that expensive. I bought a recurve bow and some arrows from a sporting goods store_ and that kept me entertained for a while. There are some areas in national parks where camping isn't allowed_ but they're limited. Just look up the back country camping/no back country camping sign and look for it. You can also just look up BLM (bureau of land management) land near you_ as not all of them are national parks.   A lot of truck stops have showers_ and the most I've ever paid for one was 15 bucks for like an hour. They usually provide soap_ shampoo_ and towels. If you don't have a job_ get one as close to your campsite as possible so you don't spend too much on gas. I used to drive 45 miles one way from my campsite to work_ and it was expensive. But_ you won't be paying for rent or utilities_ so your money will stack until you're comfortable getting a place.   If that route isn't an option for you_ you'll want to look for 24 hour stores_ neighborhoods where street parking is allowed (it'll be obvious)_ churches_ and truck stops. Rest stops tend to have a two hour or so limit. Walmart either does or doesn't allow overnight parking_ depending on the store. They almost always have signs up in the parking lot letting you know if it's not allowed_ but if you aren't sure_ just go in_ say you're traveling_ and ask if you're allowed to park over night. No harm in asking. Also_ if you're parked somewhere you're not supposed to be_ the worst that will happen is you'll get woken up by a cop tapping on your window_ telling you to move. Don't go to the same place over and over again. If this is what you have to do_ then use your days off to go out to a national park and camp there_ if only to get a break from the city.   And finally_ I just wanna say that I lived this way for about 8 months_ split between two areas. I've also lived this way with a girlfriend who was down for it. Those were_ by far_ the happiest months of my life. I didn't rely on anyone_ the only bills I had to worry about were my phone bill and gas for my car. I got to camp in some truly beautiful places_ and bathe in beautiful (albeit very cold) rivers. It's gotten me out of some living situations that were making me miserable. I felt free_ and I kinda wish I could do it now.  Anyway_ good luck OP.,NeverNude-Ned,Large-Organization-4,3,3,1,3,1530
j2zexe5,I may not have any advice directly for your situation but given that you are very young_ there is something to consider.   While you are working_ gain a skill or if you already have skills_ work on improving those skills significantly.    The reason why I say this is because rent and inflation has been through the roof over the past two now going on three years.   That way when you get a place of your own_ you would have skills or even certificates that will land you higher paying jobs_ that will better support you.   Never put all of your eggs into one basket because the way things have been going_ it should teach us that having more skills and specializations will significantly benefit you in the long-run. That way you will always have a leverage and never become a victim of the stratified systems that currently work against us.

Example maybe: could park in a college area on the street and blend in.

j2yk7xt,They won't file the actual eviction with the court until you have violated a posted 3-day vacate notice.  This is good to know because usually a complex has to pay a fee to file an eviction (it's +/- $200 here in Utah). So you can extend this buffer period if you need to by telling them that you are working on getting rent from family_ Etc.   An eviction on your record makes it difficult to rent in the future. If there is an option for not getting one_ you should seek it out. Sometimes the process can be played a bit_ because complexes often don't want to pay to evict you.,INFOborg,Divine623,8,3,2,3,1530

I didn't think about that until I saw that other comment above. It does remind me now of a girl I was at  the shelter with a few years ago_that would get food delivered from people online_ usually pizza or Chinese and she would share it_ it was great.

102nom2,,j2v89z3,Thiiiiis. Most people aren't going to check your credit for a room. Check craigslist. I've found a place to live for 6 months to a year, a couple of times.
102nom2,j2u86mh,,Oh man. Listen, you can find second chance apartments or a private landlord or a room to rent until your credit improves. Get the free credit builders cred.ai, seedfi, and grow. A secured card with discover or cap 1. You can do this. Worst case a too expensive by the week or month motel, but it won't be forever
102nom2,j2vgohd,,You have a job and some pocket money, I think you might find someone who will rent out a room to you. Maybe find a situation where you work for room and board would be ideal. Live off top ramen, eggs and bread til you can buy a used car. You got this!  P.s. I currently have $13 to my name and no car but doing the best I can. Get paid this Friday and can’t wait to buy some food.
102nom2,j2ull8p,,I understand how you feel I've been there.  My credit is jacked, I was homeless and if I would have had a quick and easy way, like a gun while I was going through it I would not be here right now.    you may have tried or thought  of some of these already but some suggestions:    Is there anyone friend, family or someone that you could stay with that you could offer to give some money too each week?  Until you can figure some things out.    You could try maybe looking for a room to rent, if you're comfortable with that rather then an apartment. There might not be so much emphasis on the credit.    Contact local homeless services, your local DHS etc... see what assistance they offer. Even if you don't think you'll be eligible still try. At the very least they may be able to get you into a shelter if they're openings.    I know how tough it is to be in this situation and how hopeless it feels. I'm really sorry you're going through this.
102nom2,j2u81ic,,You can dramatically improve your credit by getting a secured credit card and being obsessive about paying it off every month.  The only downside is that you will not be able to access the money held to secure it for about a year.

102nom2,j2uq1o3,,You other option starts with breathing out slowly and inhaling, then making the conscious decision to live…not just for yourself, but eventually for others.  I think changing your perspective, your mind on certain things are key…once while visiting a Coffee shop, I over heard an older man say to a woman accompanying him, “you need to change your thinking on that.”  Initially, I was taken aback thinking it being rude, but it actually wasn’t.  That has stuck with me since and I sometimes bring it into question, especially when I’m frustrated due to not getting anywhere on a particular issue.  I had to decide to give up on something today, but in doing so, I’ll benefit later by not further dreading the decision and optimizing what funds will be saved  now in making the decision early.  OP, try to look at things in a light that helps to balance things out for you.
102nom2,j2vhyr5,,Can you stay in an AirBnB? In my area room in an AirBnB is only a little more than a regular room for rent.  Killing yourself when you have a job and cash is many things not good, but, most, relevant, is short-sighted. You are necessary to the world. Use thr cash in thr bank to find a motel room or roomshare for the next 3-7 days. Then it will be easier to problem solve the housing situation.
102nom2,j2xbss5,,Lots of good suggestions here, but I’d also recommend taking a look at transitional housing programs. For homeless people in specific job fields they sometimes have private dorm rooms for you to stay in for several months. Gives you a chance to improve your credit while having a roof over your head. I’d say to call 211 in the city or township you’re in and inquire to speak to a social worker. Good luck! You got this. I believe in you.
102nom2,j2xdj2a,,You got to rent a room. If you find some people who are renting an apartment and who will rent you a room ask them if you can have a utility bill in your name and pay it on time every month to improve your credit. I also do this for housemates in a house I own if they want (I give them the money to pay the bills and they get the credit bump).  You can of course also use credit cards and any other form borrowing that you pay off without incurring debt to improve your credit so that one day you'll be able to rent an apartment if that's what you choose to do.

102l4e1,,j2u3hse,I agree with this. It is correct.  You must learn to rely on yourself, and only have faith in yourself. Trying to rely on others to survive will always leave you in the lurch, and under their thumb.   You must strive to find yourself a better job. Being able to pay for a room gives you more power and freedom. But it will never just be handed to you. You must work to make it happen.  If you continue to place your trust and believe in other people, you will learn the hard way that it is better to be alone than to be betrayed.
102l4e1,,j35ph0i,Thanks this one actually is nice and true. I agree with the last bit completely also
102jm3a,j2tte0q,,RVs aren't amazing on gas but would make living at campgrounds much more comfortable and house like, you can buy state park passes and stuff and that would basically be your only rent as long as the pass lasts, letting you camp pretty much anywhere for certain amounts of time. You can save alot of money that way, you just have to hop around whatever campsites are around forever which could get draining I'd imagine, but I rolled with some people doing that and you can literally run it all flying a sign for a few hours a day, so if you had a job you could stack cash pretty quick and maybe be able to just buy land or a house in the future. I'm planning on doing that myself and know some that are much farther along than me, I live in a minivan rn.  The bonus is also you can just travel literally anywhere and there's your house right along with you, state park pass, boom now you live there. Sleep at walmart for work in town, dissappear into the forest on the weekends. Figure out where has the lowest cost of living with the nicest environment and just go there, and work until you got a decent living situation like land or a house or something. The possibilities really open up when you get something like that cause you can shower and eat actual home cooked meals and shit in your own toilet, *stand up and walk*, lay down flat in a your own proper bed, watch tv, if you have a dog or cat it'll be extatic to just be in a house, so you end up feeling alot better about everything. I sure did when I lived in one briefly on a few separate occasions, they weren't mine tho.
102jm3a,,j2wlzkk,Are RVs expensive to maintain? I always wondered how someone would fix a mechanical issue if they are out in the middle of Utah with a giant RV they can’t move.
102jm3a,,j2wobih,A maintenence regimen is a good practice, frequently checking everything and getting the problem before its a real issue helps a bit. Parts for RVs can be pretty expensive depending on what you have, some rvs are built on popular vehicles, like the Ford and Chevrolet ones are just built on E-350 vans, so parts would be a little easier to come by. You gotta be selective with buying rvs, but if you get the right one from the right dude it'll last you quite awhile. Like try to find an old man who used it once or twice in the 90s and wants it out of his yard now or something, there's a few of those kinds of people around usually and they offer a shocking price for what it is sometimes. My homies almost got a legit, 100%, airstream from the 70s in near perfect condition, for less than 10 grand, those go for literally hundreds of thousands. My homies got fucked in the end cause he played takebacksies and gave it to his daughter, which kinda sucked.   Buying a truck and pulling a trailer is also a solution, or buying a truck and a camper that sits in the bed, the truck bed camper can be cramped at times but then you'd just have to worry about the truck going wrong and not just the whole house
102jm3a,j2tywgm,,I got out of 5 years of homelessness through sections 8.
102jm3a,,j3fy2rh,How did you do that,? I'm diagnosed with multiple mental illness and can't get on disability due to the wait time and that no one will believe me. I feel so done with everything. I'm exhausted and tired.
102jm3a,,j3g8ypg,I got approved for SSI from social security sending me for a neuropsychology exam. I got section 8 before the SSI. I had my doctor write a letter saying I am disabled and how long I been homeless for and that fast tracked my section 8 approval.
102jm3a,j2u8nq7,,I did it. Took me over 5 years but I did it. This woman I knew she told me early on that this was but a season of my life and that like a season it would pass. Seemed like the longest season ever but it did. Didn't happen for me until I went into the system and started working with it.
102jm3a,j2u8lyw,,Consider coolworks.com. There are a lot of jobs that provide housing and food.
102jm3a,,j2ugwpi,I'll check it out, thank you!
102jm3a,j2vuble,,It's very possible. I've done it many times over the last 15 years. I travel around nomadically every three months or so. I aged out of foster care and had no roots or anyone to turn to so I just started moving around. I figured out if you camp someplace far away from anyone else so you can get good rest so can hold a job. Go to a temp agency and tell them you'll take anything that ways well. It's never failed me in any city. I work for three months and spend the bare minimum strictly on food. It's kinda miserable but after three months of saving alone, I've gotten myself off the street many times and into a nice apartment.    Recently I was lucky enough to find two people who wanted a house so I asked if they wanted to split it three ways and get a house and just work as a team. It's been a year and a few months and it's working out great. We all make our own money and work as a village. We went in on a 2 bedroom house to rent. It's way cheaper and more spacious than an apartment.    We split all the bills, and share one vehicle carpooling to work different days. We share problems while being considerate to not make unnecessary problems. I cook most of the meals and grocery shop for the house from a list we make. We sit down and have a weekly dnd game at our 6-foot dining table, it's a fold-up plastic table but hell it's a clean table and I'm happy about having it.   My point is you can make it. Don't give up. Have a goal in mind and be flexible because it might change for the better. I was planning to be an island beach bum by now. I was gonna hitch a ride on a boat to Puerto Rico and figure it out from there. Fishing and relaxing in a Hammock.   The biggest thing to remember is this is part of your journey.  It may suck but the worse it seems now the more you'll be able to laugh at how crazy things were when you look back.   For example, I've had my hand shoved in a lawn mower, half my face burned off, lost my legs for a year after getting stuck under a semi (physical therapy is truly magic I'm telling you, i swear some of them are sadists tho), I've been stabbed 5 times, my head split open, and shoes melted so bad I had to cut them off my feet, fought off five junkies with a 15-inch kukri on the outskirts of a town by campfire light and lived to talk about it, hit by a truck on a gravel road and launched 15 feet into a ditch and woke up sometime later all gimpy. *AND I still don't qualify for disability.* lmfao   I'm hard-headed and used to be pretty reckless but some of us take a rough path while others can learn from their mistakes early on. I hope you learn faster than me.   Life can throw a lot at you but you can make it. Everyone has their shit they have to experience some more some less. Just know that if you want things to change they can just plan and stay flexible. Find that razor-edged balance between reckless and overly cautious. You have to take calculated risks to make changes.   No matter what happens every day find a little thing to make you smile. So long as you can take pleasure in the little things everything will work out in the end. Besides, it's about the journey and the memories you make on the way to your goal.
102jm3a,j2tw05e,,I would suggest getting an rv that would be your cheapest option.Its like having your own home on wheels 😜.
102jm3a,j2ujeve,,It's extremely difficult and I'd say damn near impossible for some people.  It all depends on the situation.  I know that if my mom didn't have a HCV then we would be completely fucked with no chance of ever affording a place.  When I was working full time in medical field I didn't even make enough to live on my own. I lived with my cousin/her bf  and we all split things 3 ways.  At one point me and cousin who both had full time jobs me in a doctor's office and her in medical billing were looking for a place for us and her daughter who was a baby at the time so we would have needed  a two bedroom.  We couldn't find anything that we could afford even searching in the worst places and that was about 5-6 years ago.     Things today are the worst I've ever seen. I barely made it out of homelessness my mom's HCV was going to expire Oct. 3rd. I found an apartment at the end of August. After 8 months of searching and 3 months of being homeless which lasted another month before we could move.  The price of rent is absolutely insane plus the extreme and ridiculous requirements like making 3x the amount of rent and near perfect credit scores.  The waiting lists for section 8 where I live is about 10 years. I really don't know how other low/no income people survive, it's usually by living with family members. For those who can afford rent, it's what most of their paycheck goes towards. That's why there are so many people with full time jobs who are still homeless.   For those that are homeless due to addiction/severe mental illness the support needed to help them needs to be comprehensive involving medical/psych treatment, financial assistance, living assistance depending on their condition.  Which just isn't there for them. Especially since most assistance denies anyone who has a drug addiction or criminal record. It's really bad out here for a lot of people and it's so easy for those who don't have to deal with it to just brush it off and separate themselves from it because it doesn't effect them or because they see the homeless as different then themselves.
102jm3a,,j2yldvl,It’s also that what might be needed to help homeless addicts, mentally ill,   and/or those with a criminal record is so overwhelming and astronomically expensive that many people just give up even worrying about it. It seems impossible, and may be impossible. I’m a former heroin addict and I met my husband at a long term residential rehab where the worst cases often get sent. We are of the very, very few that made it out. Even after two years of treatment, the majority ran right back out to get high and so many of the people we knew are dead that I’ve lost count. No one can afford to financially support an active addict and if they don’t put the work in to get themselves together then there’s nothing you can do. It really does seem hopeless and insurmountable.
102jm3a,j2xtjjf,,You guys both need to work as much as possible and get as much money saved as you can. Keep bills to a minimum. Ditch expensive habits smoking and 420 will also impact any housing search. ...you might rehome the pet since you are homeless and you have a better chance of finding housing pet free. There are also fosters and non profits that might temp take in the pet.   Check craigslist or FB marketplace and see if anyone maybe has a casita..again the pet maybe a problem...hotels are way too expensive and are not sustainable so avou the hotel route they will just take your money
102jm3a,j2tknnd,,Keep working hard and you'll find your way back.  A van can be good because no rent but also can have its own problems because of parking, zoning, limited space and amenities, etc.  Rent is a treadmill that many never graduate from to home ownership.  The only way to get ahead in a capitalist society is to find ways to make your money work for you. When you do this, they're called assets and they tend to be protected from inflation, unlike wages.
102jm3a,,j2tt8sk,Thanks for the encouragement. I really appreciate it. It's hard being positive all the time.

102jm3a,,j2vfdjy,You can find seasonal jobs on coolworks.com and they usually provide housing and often meals.
102jm3a,j2uz6sa,,Check out the website affordablehousing.com. Apply for all the affordable housing you can. If you need help with the fees, move-in, & deposits, ask around to churches. Decide your own goals. If living room in an RV is really what you want, then do that. Living with other people is very difficult. I would rather be camping. I would speak with a financial counselor or social worker. Maybe someone can give you some suggestions. Some of the churches will help you with this. You can also apply at job training that provides housing. TeenChallenge and Delancey Street both offer job training and free housing.  There can be a lot of pressure to conform. You don’t need to be like everybody else. I don’t know if you or your fiancé have done any time in jail (I hope not), but there are some “reentry” programs that offer housing and job training.  I would also go to the unemployment office and ask them. Sometimes they have classes on how to do a job search. You can take a personality test to find out what kind of work you might like. There is an excellent book “What Color is Your Parachute”.  And the local library can be a resource. Librarians can help you with a bizillion things.  Check with your parks & rec department for free classes. There is a big demand for people to be electricians, stone masons, and other construction jobs. They will also offer training.  Let us know how you are doing. You won’t be homeless forever.

It comes with other problems but it’s often a good goal if you can afford it. Check out sites like cheaprvliving.com that show how to do it. Stay away from most of the vanlife videos where people spend thousands building the perfect setup and end up moving back in with their parents. If you look a little, there are plenty of people living in cars and vans and doing great.
102jm3a,j2whqaf,,As I write from time to time, homelessness is a complete breakdown of basic humanity, the entire system from your mother to the United Nations having failed you, and you failing the system. The older one gets the less likely to rebuild humanity, plain and simple. Not to mention the ongoing massacre of the middle class, which means that even if you rebuild some of the soft tissue of your life and somehow learn to live with your uncle or your friend or whatever, it will be a life of minimal space and poverty. Anyway, enough with the good news :)   Unless a miracle happens, most people that will come out of homelessness will do so with subsidised housing, with all the waiting, heartbreak and uncertainty that will bring. But I wanted to mention the elephant in the room, home ownership. For me and others who don't have severe mental or physical problems, our housing fate had something to do with little interest or investment in home ownership. Yeah, I know I sound like a madman, people don't have $1000 for the rent and I'm talking about hundreds of thousands, but it's home ownership that keeps billions from homelessness, and it is the closest to subsidised housing one can get just by saving money with a life partner and focusing on affordability and sustainability.  Sure, affordability is an issue in general terms, but not so much if you're going to fight for your modest home and mortgage tooth and nail.  I won't lie, once you've spent a month or two without paying rent the idea of tightening a $200K noose around your neck is very unappealing, but it's also part of rebuilding our humanity, having a couch or a garage for the next fellow human being in need, renting out a room when help with the mortgage is needed. Get hitched, get a mortgage, live grumpy ever after!
102jm3a,,j2yk4f3,It is true, if you can just save up the minimal amount needed for an FHA mortgage or first time home buyer program or something then homeownership is the best way to go.  I know that’s easier said then done, but for those that can, try to avoid renting.

102jm3a,j2w0wn1,,You can escape homelessness with dedication, self-discipline, and a little help from social service agencies, family, friends, and good luck. If you aren't completely mentally or physically ill or lost, you have a good chance. The permanent homeless seem to be those who gave up and accepted their lifestyle, chose it, or are too damaged or incapable of doing what is necessary to get out of their situation.
102jm3a,,j30lvsy,There is also the in between. Been unofficially homeless/couch surfing for two years. Been officially homeless for 10 months. SSI takes time to develop. Section 8, there is a waiting list. Welfare might be on hold if you have to recertify, or for whatever reason etc.. If you want to do something fun, you can't. You lose energy, and your soul and spirit is broken, to attend social events. You don't have the money either, and have to be at the shelter before 7 etc. You can't donate Plasma, if you don't have a lease/residency proof, and prove you're not a desultory person, you are sometimes banned from their facilities if you use a charity address. You feel you are out of options.  Then I feel, at 31 years of age, (I'll be 32 on the 16th lol) I made it this long, aside from ocassional cigarettes, and very light liquor use, I am drug, and ill gotten criminal activity free. But it's hard for people not to be tempted I guess. No money, no help, so they turn to drugs, and negativity, and toxicity. Which is not an excuse, don't get me wrong. But still.  I feel, I get what you're saying, but it came across like we aren't trying. My welfare was shut off until March,, unless I get my disability wavers signed, which is an adventure. I was not selected for a section 8 voucher. I'm waiting to hear back from social security, as I'm autistic. I'm Black and gay, with no money, and no boyfriend.

I got to keep my cat because I rented from a private landlord and even though it said no pets after she met my kids and I she changed her mind. I also got to keep my cat at the shelter because I was in a shelter apartment. I did have to give up my other cats but one was adopted right away the other 3 went into a rescue who had no actual shelter they just used foster homes. 2 were adopted together. While at the shelter I found a 6 month old kitten who i tried to hide but he walked out right in front of my case worker. I found him a home on this site.   https://rehome.adoptapet.com/   On adopt a pet you put in pictures and a bio about the animals and people who want to meet them email you. You pick out their family. Make sure to meet in a public place and have someone with you. I got my kitten adopted in 1 day. I miss him a lot.   If you are keeping them this organization in Nevada helps homeless people and their pets all over U.S. and parts of Canada. If you go on their website you can put in your city or zip code and you can find free pet food. They also have resources on their website. They also pay for crates and vet care but for those you have to call them. From Boston I would call my time 1-3pm EST  they are open M-F 9-3pm   here is the the site     http://petsofthehomeless.org/    Good luck I wish the best for you and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask or dm me.

j2tv9h1,I don’t suggest saving up for a van because I have a feeling it’s goin to get tougher for people in cars_ vans_ and rv’s in the coming years. There’s a few reasons for this. The ruling people are trying to get people to drive much less and no longer be able to afford or own your own vehicle. They are making it hard and expensive to repair your vehicle. They will continue to increase cost of gas. U might have trouble finding parts for older cars on purpose. The only way to get out of this situation is through God. I mean it would help to find a church u can stand going to and start making connections there. The government won’t help u. You need people who are compassionate and genuinely can offer assistance. You also need to have faith that God will create opportunities that will help u get out of homelessness. U can’t let the seemingly impossible circumstances make u feel like it’s hopeless. God intended for him to be our sufficiency_ not the state_ other people_ etc.,Difficult_Ad_9392,abyssal_dreams,64,-6,1,3,1530

I’d call now before you're 18 though to see if you can get access to somewhere right away.   Please be careful of any ‘offers’ for help you get. I’m not trying to scare you_ but you’re a prime target not just for abuse_ but for trafficking so try to stick with youth shelters or local shelters and not resort to sleeping bags or a tent. You’re going to have to be vigilant about your safety. Contact as many resources in the government and shelters as you can to ask for help.   If your friend can house you now see if your school will let you finish remotely. We just had a pandemic and everyone did online school.

j2r3xln,Try to stay clean_ substance wise_ as much as possible. You have a better chance avoiding getting taken advantage of if you're sober.  You will be targeted in a shelter_ so establish a connection to school resources ASAP. Your education councilors need to know about your living circumstances the first time you meet them so that they can help you avail yourself to services and resources you qualify for. Hopefully this will include contacts for affordable student housing and student health insurance/clinic services.  Also_ contact your local YWCA to ask about shelter options for victims of domestic abuse.,INFOborg,kiraikisu,25,2,1,3,1530

j2ryxzw,You can quickly and easily get into a room for rent within 3 week.   Facebook Marketplace -> Rentals -> rooms for rent  Prices range from $400 - $900 a month depending on where you live. Many places have furnished rooms included. To move in_ it usually costs first months rent and a security deposit (usually around $50-$200_ some don’t require it). You sign onto the lease and get to have a cheap room for 3-6 months guaranteed_ sometimes a year contract. There’s plenty of young women roomating_ and because you are a young woman still in school_ you’ll be priority (meaning you’ll likely be first choice for many people renting out a room in their home). Many people are very nice and don’t care about a great credit score. As long as you can pay the rent every month_ you’re good.    This option is much cheaper and quicker than trying to rent an apartment. And because your dealing with people instead of a rental company_ they’ll be understanding and willing to negotiate. Also_ utilities_ wifi_ and everything is usually included in the advertised monthly rent_ and you won’t need to worry about buying appliances_ furniture for the whole house_ and setting up wifi etc. You share the living space_ kitchen_ and bathrooms with the other house mates (You can easily find one that has all females).    I would say_ save up to get a used car (Facebook marketplace is a great option to buy a used car_ it’s where I got mine). If not_ Uber or taking the bus. Or_ if you work close enough and school is close enough_ get a bike to ride around on. Or even a scooter (like a moped)_ you don’t need a license and you’ll be able to ride on the street_ but not the highway. If you don’t want to go to school physically_ speak with one of your school counselors to see if you can do online school (to get around having to find transportation). They should be able to give you options and tell you how it’ll work. Also_ your counselor may be able to provide other useful resources for you if you explain your situation.,cherribumm,kiraikisu,25,1,1,3,1530

I have a lot to get done in the 9-3 [a trip to the pharmacy can take all day with public transportation]. If I were brave enough to panhandle_ I would only be able to eat one meal.

j2q76dn,"Homelessness has a lot of different looks. I only told a small number of friends about my situation and a few were shocked that I consider myself homeless because I'm crashing in my dad's guest room. I'm lucky as shit_ no doubt about it_ but I'm here illegally. Once the neighbors catch on that I'm here I'll have to spend chunks of the week in my car so I maintain guest status vs illegal tenant status. Counting my blessings_ but it's still not having the safety of *knowing* where I'll be tonight and I can't get regular custody of my son unless there's a place to stay. I think my friends don't want to think of someone they know_ someone they relate to and who is as smart and educated as them be homeless because it really makes them confront how few barriers are standing in between *them* and homelessness. So I'm just calling it couch surfing and hiding in plain sight to make everyone comfortable. But it's not like ""hashtag van life"" was my choice_ and I'm so scared and stressed and lonely.

Not having to be somewhere_ to cook it all_  to clean_ to answer to anyone_ to have to deal with the seemingly inevitable  drama_ it's good.   Don't get me wrong_ eventually I know I'm going to have to work harder on making some friends and getting more of a life but right now I'm still mentally decompressing from years of drama and overwork and I'm just enjoying not having it be like that.

j2ole9u,i usually give a person i just meet a few chances to reciprocate if i am nice/giving towards them to see how they act or react towards it. friendship isn't a given thing to me_ it's being calculated with what you do and say_ not knowing the other person's intentions. of course there will be times when you are lonely. i've tried inviting people into my life and had them not appreciate what i was trying to do or simply not care. some people just don't want close intimate relationships for fear of being hurt. oh well. as long as you do you_ you're gonna find people that ARE for you and AREN'T. every friendship starts out as two strangers communicating so don't get to frustrated if you don't know what to say at first. you seem smart enough to strike a conversation with a random person on the public transportation. don't be to giving is all i can say. best of luck_ from Missouri,StopSlouchingPlease,veryberryblue,21,1,1,3,1530

You could do a charter high school like I mentioned [all students were teens in my school or early 20s_ I was homeless at the time and my school helped me find a place to stay in]_ you could take high school classes in a community college_ you could do an adult school_ or you could take the GED. Most ""youth shelters"" [basically a homeless shelter exclusively for people in their teens or early 20s] have some kind of education program_ where they help you prepare for your GED. So you'll be in a small class with other teens preparing for your GED. Not sure what option works best for you.

j2k7flq,The McKinney-Vento homeless assistance act passed in i believe 2005 or so--made it federal law--you cannot deny a homeless minor access to a public education due to lacking vaccination_ birth certificate documents_ residency etc due to homelessness.

j2k3t4a,well it depends. as someone who was also homeless through high school the answer varies on your situation. are you under the age of 18 and if so who’s supposed to be taking care of you? are you over 18 and just looking to finish your education? basically if you’re under 18 and still living with an adult you can go to school while homeless but you better not tell anyone that or come to school actually “looking” homeless or i can guarantee that an adult somehow will catch on and call CPS to get you put in custody which if you’re actually homeless and under 18 i think is a fantastic opportunity because CPS has access to grants and financial aid that can really help you achieve goals like getting your own car and house thus making you no longer homeless. but of course situations tend to be more complicated than that & also if you happen to be over 18 i would suggest getting into a GED program,XaddyXanny,NotWapata,5,2,1,3,1530

j2inc7j,"Does seem like a ""you"" problem to be honest. I think a lot of people in this world are selfish and self-absorbed_ but other people genuinely care about others and don't mind hearing their problems or their venting. I am one of those people. I've fed_ prayed for_ and given money to homeless or complete strangers. I do care about their suffering and life story. Though I think this world emphasizes selfishness and getting ahead by screwing over people_ but I think it has more exposure than seeing random acts of kindness or volunteer work with hurting people.   Just seems like you don't care or can show empathy because of your own dislike of sharing your own personal problems_ so yes_ it's self-projecting that you're doing. I wouldn't say it's bad or good_ that's just a decision you decided and are ok with. I'm not the one to judge what someone likes or dislikes.   As for me personally_ I got an awesome therapist to talk with about my own issues. No way would I just spill all the beans and tell very personal things to complete strangers. That is_ non professional people_ that studied for years and know strategies to help with my issues. I mean sometimes I can empathize or sympathize with others if they struggle with similar things I've faced_ so therefore I try to give advice or encouragement to them. Though it's not the right place to start talking about your problems_ if that makes sense.   Just like drug addicts teaching others about quitting or how they escaped that life style_ but that doesn't mean they will start telling their life story or all their problems. Just have to understand the difference_ and when it's the correct time to overshare. Meanwhile_ others are perfectly ok sharing their issues with a best friend they completely trust_ others won't even trust or talk to a therapist.  I honestly don't know why some people care or don't care_ maybe it's upbringing and never having opportunities to help others or even give a damn? Such as rich people that don't care at all about the homeless or poor people_ it has never crossed their mind nor have they been exposed to it. I guess when people suffer and go through very real and similar issues as those around them_ they grow kind and compassionate? Especially to those that are going through similar things.

My resolution this year is to feel contempt for things outside my control. Like_ feel and act as if other people and their opinions are none of my business and of no concern to me. In the last few years_ I’ve found it harder and harder to live among so many clearly selfish and self-indulgent people. Best to remember it’s got nothing to do with me.   I think I kind of understand where you’re coming from. I go to a clinic where it’s just a fact that every client there has had a tough ride and could list a hundred reasons to feel sorry for them. People don’t act like that_ tho. If I went there and started crying about how hard my life is_ yes_ I would assume something is wrong with me — major social faux pas. But_ doesn’t mean I haven’t let myself grieve and vent and talk as much as I want with a therapist or case worker or a supportive friend who also vents to me sometimes. Everyone deserves empathy.

j2odo4d,"One thing to realize about people experiencing homelessness is that all of them are traumatized.  There is a huge difference in resources/ability between people who live in a home and people who don't.   People who can plug in an alarm clock (for their cell phone)_ for instance_ have an instant advantage in being able to show up for a work interview. Such an accommodation is a prestigious amenity for those who experience homelessness_ and is far from common.  Next is the quality of sleep that you get when you are able to lock the entrance door of your home. People experiencing homelessness do not sleep like that. The experience of homelessness means that you are in fight or flight mode 24 hours a day.  The neurophysiologists would point out that this means adrenaline and cortisol all the time. They would point out that your body and your mind are not able to heal from trauma at the same rate as those who have a sound place to sleep in a home_ because the states of body equilibrium required for homeostasis (the process that heals you) is not possible without a home.  Since there is no healing on the street_ there is no comparison to make between people who are housed and people who are not. The ability and resources available to these two groups with regards to finding_ acquiring_ and maintaining a job is so far from equal that it is preposterous to assume that people experiencing homelessness ""don't want to work"".  That said_ many do work. They sleep in their cars_ or other accommodations_ and are able to maintain their jobs through a Herculean effort. They should have the respect of everyone.  Those that do not have a job often have to use tactics to survive that are frowned upon in the housed community. Sometimes it involves black markets_ sex work_ and theft. A constant element in all of those tactics is violence_ and the threat of violence is ever present.  Nevertheless_ when you speak to people who have experienced homelessness you will find that trauma is not the only thing left.   The part of them that wants peace_ that wants to heal_ that wants a home_ is still there. The desire to belong to a community_ and have authentic relationships is still there.   Even people who appear to be ""living weapons"" still have the ability to be part of a good community_ when given enough chances. But it is not easy.  I like the giving nature of Housing First_ but I think there should be more training for people entering a subsidized apartment. Life training_ survival skills that pertain to housing_ and discussions of healthy boundaries with others should be part of the housing first process_ but they are not.   What people need to understand most about those who experience homelessness is that theft and criminal activity does not erase an individuals humanity_ and their need for belonging.

j2g0qub,Hey_  I’m sorry you are having issues with your mother. I know how that feels and my mother has her own issues to the point where I do not want to hold a conversation with her anymore.  I’ve lived in campgrounds and at rest stops in my car. While living at these places I can suggest to you what you may need. First and foremost is to pray to God. Reflect on how you got yourself in the situation in the first place. Ask for forgiveness in anything you may have done wrong. You will begin to see your life open up more with some optimism.  For supplies it’s really crucial that you utilize food pantries and to make sure you have plenty of clothing at least for 7 days. Socks get lost easy so please account for that. It’s good you have a gym membership. The workouts alone can make you feel somewhat normal again and the rewarding showers take advantage of.  All in all you are not alone. This is a really good time to reflect on yourself as a person and set measurable obtainable goals to get out of your situation. Maybe it’s further education or the military or whatever. Point being is that in order to not dive your mind into the bad stuff you gotta redirect focus onto the good. Get proactive in something that is going to build you up.   This is the rock bottom for sure but just know that everything in life is temporary and not the end for you. The biggest advice I could prob give is practicing self care and taking care of yourself physically and mentally. It can get lonely at times so if you ever need a listening ear please feel free to DM.  Happy Holidays to you and I’m look forwarding to seeing your progression!   Godspeed. 🙏🏽,Long-Translator1602,thebigboohoo,41,6,1,8,1024

j2fxa55,when i was on the streets i always referred to myself as a Vagabond - as I always had a full time income stream coming in but due to felonies and poor credit/evictions in the past just couldn't rent a mainstream apartment--and didn't have the mental fortitude to get along with roommates so I just kinda went my own way for a long time camping in hidden spots at churches and parks--showering and storing duffel bag at the local rec center till I could save up for a camping van. But never was addicted to drugs or alcohol or had severe mental illness--just a string of unfortunate poor judgement--and reaped what I sewed.

I can wake up_ start a small fire make myself some coffee_ wash up with a wet rag or baby wipes and head to a temp agency for day to day labor to get some money in my pocket. Holidays I'd just putter around my campsite breaking down wood for fire needs_ making my camp more comfortable_ I'd fish (string stick and a hook) as I usually set up on a water edge_ when I wanna just relax I would watch movies I downloaded onto my phone last time I was near good wifi.   Sometimes I'd dumpster dive at grocery store for things that were still good but expired to cook up and share with other people in similar situations as myself. We'd go to a park and use the grill to cook up steaks frequently as it was common the expensive steaks at this one store never got purchased and would be tossed out package and all. Perfect condition just dated so it couldn't be sold. So on cooler days they would still be good by the time we could sneak back there and digg for them.   I've made many homeless banquets on a wood fired park grill and a couple sticks to flip and serve.   Some resources are less obvious and less desirable but you can really live well if you're willing to go the lengths. Or maybe I'm just glorifying making the best of a shitty situation.

j2dyho7,I wrote and published a poem called Right to Die. I definitely believe in it_ and plan to go out on my own terms. I find it annoying that some doctors may require proof of “terminal illness” but I suppose I understand why. When people’s basic needs such as shelter_ safety and food needs are not met than of course more likeliness to suffer from mental illness/ depression but in my case I feel like I’ve been dehumanized and lack a sense of belonging. My family has always been dysfunctional_ and my friends are mostly fair weather friends. I also was born premature and things that come easy to most people do not come easy to me. It’s been too hard for me to keep up with the rat race and other than some traveling I want to do_ life is generally pretty lonely and unfulfilling for me. I look forward to eternal sleep and leaving the stress of survival behind. There’s these sacro pods in Switzerland that make it painless_ and ideally that’s how I’d like to go out but I live in the USA so I’ll take what I can get. 😏,bat2ghost,Savonarola1452,51,11,2,3,1530

j2md8ko,Despite having depression_ or CPTSD/PTSD_ if a person can hold fair reason and judgment over themselves and the view of life_ then they should be able to make choices on their own. A person suffering sever depression doesn't think like those without_ they have what some considered a warped view of life and death. I think despite serve depression or any other mental illness akin to this_ we should not offer suicide so quickly. We should strive to help people live their lives to the fullest despite their disadvantages and not doing so casts a clear lack of unimportance on human life. We shouldn't take it off the table_ because then we suggest that a person doesn't have a right to life or death despite their shortcomings_ but we also should discourage it. People live with depression for years_ decades_ it never really goes away in most cases_ and yet people can try and many have strive for a fulfilled life_ they can rely on others not to give them any easy way out_ but to know it's there_ and lift them up from that.   The biggest difference is the different way of thinking about this type of suicide: easy/hard way or a safe/dangerous way out. Many_ many people who want to die don't really want to die_ they want the pain to stop and see killing themselves as the only way out. Those who want to clock out see death as a kind of endless sleep_ the next step_ not a solution but a choice.  Those who see it as an escape should have massive support and help_ and once they can rationalize death as something that doesn't take the pain away_ they should be considered a person who isn't at risk of regretting.,ElevenOneTwo,Savonarola1452,51,1,3,8,1024
j2egvkk,I'd do it if it were available. If I ended myself on my own_ they'd no doubt blame my diagnosis like they did my friend_ funny how a diagnosis is enough to justify a suicide_ so people can shrug it off saying well couldn't be helped.

j2gaay2,I believe it will be used in the near future as a budget-saving measure by killing people off that are too costly to care for.  The reason for this_ is because like everything else in our societies_ the way it will be regulated and developed_ it will be decided by the top. Not by the majority.  Just like how the best advanced treatments for cancer and other diseases are reserved for the rich.  I believe the masses will be steered into it_ just like the majority of humans have been steered into barren childless lifestyles for the past 30 years.  The middle and working class elderly will be left with fewer and fewer resources_ savings_ and quality of life_ until they will eventually be pressured or encouraged to take their own lives_ because it will be the only affordable option.  Euthanasia will become the standard. Living into older age will be reserved for the rich and others few elites deemed deserving.,tuggyforme,Savonarola1452,51,3,1,3,1530

j2dsnkp,I agree and I see why it would have benefits. I’m not against it being legalised but I find it worrying. When I said some people can’t decide I was meant cases like psychosis which does impact your judgement and can be temporary. There are so many opportunities for it to cause harm or be abused_ there are so many difficult questions and I don’t know if it’s up to other individuals to decide_ like should there be an age limit? It’s like how the death penalty is bad because innocent people might be tried guilty. If you accidentally kill someone who you shouldn’t have_ you can’t undo it. That risk makes me worry because the desire to end one’s life due to mental illness is much more common than untreatable cases of mental illness. Anyway I’m not against it and I definitely see how it might help some people,daypanay,Savonarola1452,51,2,2,3,1530
j2fl6yh,No. The sufferer has a right to end their own life. Euthanasia is a govt program based on Eugenics designed to remove undesirables from their populations. Govts have no right to say who may/not die_ when_ and how. Except for maps and rapists.,Clobhairchaun,Savonarola1452,51,1,4,3,1530
j2dfvbz,Why do you need the government to euthanize you? It's easy enough to do it on your own if you really want to. And aren't mentally ill people not in their right minds anyway? So how can they make a sound decision legally or does their doctor decide for them?,smoked0g,Savonarola1452,51,-3,1,3,1530
j2di3ho,I'm involved in another forum where this is brought up. Basically do it yourself methods are scary and violent and not guaranteed to succeed potentially leaving you in a worse position. For instance we have people that have lived through shooting themselves in the head and now are still alive but with brain damage. We have people who jump off Bridges which is a terrifying act and they still survive. I have a friend who's rehearsed committing suicide and wanted to do it many times but just can't bring himself to do it. He's fantasized about having a big jar of pills where most of them are benign but one of them is the pill so every day he takes a pill and goes about his life and one day his troubles will be over.    So the debate isn't about legalizing suicide because it's already available the debate is about making it so that our society and medical profession is allowed to help you do it without so much fear and uncertainty and pain.  As to your question about mental illness_ most mental illnesses do not render you incapable of making such choices. Sure some people are so far gone they don't even have a sense of where they are or have ability to make decisions and also people with things like mania aren't necessarily in the right mind to make a decision. But for things like depression schizophrenia when managed bipolar when they're not in the middle of a manic episode dissociative identity disorder and a whole host of others the person is by and large here with us and aware of their condition and aware of how much pain they are in.  For those that are so mentally gone that they cannot make and informed decision_ as far as I know we are not discussing coerced euthanasia yet which generally would be understood to be murder.,PurpleDancer,Savonarola1452,51,7,3,3,1530
j2erucr,For most mental illness I'm not an advocate. Mental illness can be treated. It's not like having terminal cancer or some kind of disease where you waste away to the point where you're locked inside your own body and can't move.   I have issues with chronic depression_ C-PTSD and anxiety. I was abused by my alcoholic  parents and bullied to the point of misery as a kid by other kids. Suicide has always been a constant thought in the back of my brain since I was like 5. I was homeless for 5 years plus which did not help at all with that.   While I was homeless I thought about it all the time. I felt subhuman and I was in so much pain physically and mentally I honestly wanted to just close my eyes and die. I was technically in therapy at the time but the therapists I had did nothing to help.   Flash foward and I'm housed and doing much better. I have gone whole weeks without dark thoughts. Being housed and stable_ having an income that pays my major bills that helped me a lot. So did not having to take care of or answer to anyone for the first time in my life. I finally terminated any relationship with my toxic bunch of half siblings too.  Not allowing anyone in my life who is toxic and who might disrupt me mentally or who might bully me. Finally learning to say NO to people who just want to use me or abuse me for whatever reason that's been a majorly positive thing for me. First time ever that I put me first and you know what? I'm truly content with that and genuinely happy for the first time in my whole life.   It's still not easy sometimes. I have a couple of autoimmune diseases and major back issues. I have bad chronic pain issues and arthritis to the point where I am just in agony some days. I still get cranky and think dark thoughts when I'm really hurting but thoughts of suicide are few and far between these days because I like my life and who I am now.   I've been through hell and back several times this past decade. I lost almost everything and I had to basically claw my way back to sanity and stability. I'm proud of myself that I did that. I'm still working on getting a life and dealing with major pain and illness but it's BETTER and when the dark thoughts intrude I can put them on the backburner and not dwell on them constantly.   If I had a terminal wasting disease or was going to die horribly from some major cancer then I most certainly would head to someplace like Canada where I could terminate my life when I was ready. I'm not a masochist and I'm not traditionally religious.   I don't believe in suffering for the sake of it. I have my limits in terms of how much physical pain I am willing to endure. I don't particularly relish the thought of a truly painful death. But killing myself for mental reasons? Nah. That I can deal with_ live with.   I'd have to be very ill physically to consider it. I do believe in death with dignity and that it's my right to decide for myself what to do in extreme circumstances. I will never judge anyone else for their choice even if I don't agree with it. But for me mental illness just isn't a reason for euthanasia.,mtempissmith,Savonarola1452,51,1,1,9,1231
j2ftpza,Everyone should have the right_ if they are of sound mind and not under duress_ to end their life if they freely choose to do so. It's their life_ and they should be able to do as they wish with it. However_ being trapped in poverty and isolated from social support by the society around you is clearly a form of duress. These are not decisions being made freely by Free people — these are people acting under duress to escape the torment being placed on them by ending their lives. It's an absolutely disgusting situation.  And I was go as far as to call it murder. It is murder through physical_ mental_ social_ and financial abuse to the point that a person's survival mechanisms completely fail. It is no different than psychologically abusing someone until they commit suicide — except that you're throwing in an entire system of societal abuse along with it. If we lived in a just society_ then those implementing and performing this euthanasia_ as well as those who have driven these people to make that choice_ would be held accountable for murder with all that entails. The fact that we have reached such a disgusting point is proof that our society is inherently unjust_ and its existence is no longer justifiable. These are gross human rights violations_ and we must find a way to hold those responsible for accountable_ otherwise it's only going to get worse.,thelink225,Savonarola1452,51,1,1,3,1530

How do you establish that someone with a severe enough mental illness to request this_ is in a stable state of mind to choose death? That does not compute.  For most mental health issues_ a LOT can be resolved through proper support_ including lifestyle changes_ therapy_ and medication. It is extremely rare to have a truly medication resistant condition.  Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem_ as they say. I think it should only be self-administered_ if at all... to allow the person complete freedom to back out at any moment. I don't think any government or healthcare official should be given this power. It goes completely against the most important tenant of medicine_ the Hippocratic Oath_ ""First_ do no harm.""  The mentally ill population is so underserved. This can't possibly be the best solution that a government could come up with. The current state of access to a proper diagnosis_ therapy_ medication_ support groups_ emergency services... is abysmal.

j2pi1pv,Yes. I think some might have been misdiagnosed. Others might be romantically challenged. In the Netherlands people on disability who received services from an escort reported being much less depressed. People also mainly use suicide as a way to get attention. Most survivors instantly regret their decisions. Maybe if I was exposed to 20 grays of radiation I might not want to suffer through that. But people who have treatable conditions or just need to get laid shouldn't be getting a pass for suicide. Doctors aren't perfect and our system can give someone the run around for years with a misdiagnosis. A lot of people have been given only months to live and survived another few decades.

That's money you're using instead of putting it towards the rent for the apartment.  If you have free time_ volunteer at the food banks.

j2a3vn2,I am sorry to hear that. You cannot let your mom bring you down or have you end up homeless again. If she is not going to treat her mental illness or help manage it there is not much you can do. She can figure out her own housing.  Craigslist and [roomies.com](https://roomies.com) have alot of ads for roommates or call an apt locator service.

j2a8upt,Sounds like you and I are battling with the same issue. Having a parent who fails to address their own mental health issues can be detrimental to your own health. Just make sure to take care of yourself before you can help anyone else. It’s good that you have a high paying CNA job where you are clearing around $2400 a month.   I think everyone on here is in agreement that the apartment is prob your best source right now. Hotels are extremely expensive and not worth it. Being homeless in your car is not fun as I’ve experienced that as well as living at a campground.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to pray. Pray to God and thank him for all you have now including that job and try to look at the situation with the glass half full. Joining a gym and working out can also help you to take showers and to give you those much needed endorphins.   Just remember everything in life is temporary. Good or Bad. You are being tested and depending on your attitude will ultimately determine how far you will go.   Good luck to you and your Mom and please DM if you need a listening ear. Most people don’t really need advice and already know what they need to do and some do and others don’t.   Godspeed.🙏🏽,Long-Translator1602,Secure_West1643,27,3,1,8,1024

j2bt638,I agree with most commenters that the apartment is better than the hotel. $300/wk for four weeks a month means that living in the hotel would be like paying $1200 per month in rent_ which I would assume is unaffordable. I agree with the poster who suggested asking around work or putting up a poster to see if coworkers would like to get help with their gas money by driving you to work. That would be a good deal for both parties and something totally reasonable that many people would be willing to do.  &#x200B;  For long-term income for your mom_ I suggest reaching out to an SSI/SSDI Outreach_ Access_ and Recovery (SOAR) provider in your state. (You can find the contact info for your area here: [https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/state-directory](https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/state-directory) ) It's a program designed for people who are experiencing homeless/at risk of homelessness and have a serious mental health condition (like your mom's schizophrenia). If your mom agrees_ they would do all the work to submit an application for federal disability benefits (SSI/SSDI) for her. Even if she's applied before and been denied_ she has a much MUCH better chance of being approved for SSI/SSDI with SOAR help than without. I'm currently doing the training to provide SOAR help to people in my state and the training says that the approval rate on initial application for people with SOAR help is 68%_ versus a 30% general approval rate in 2019.,SparkyDinosaur,Secure_West1643,27,2,1,3,1530

I think family is what keeps you from being homeless. How did she manage to keep you housed and fed for 21 years and all of a sudden she’s jobless and penniless? We’re missing the full story_ but I believe in sticking with family_ with the exception of physical and sexual abuse and major drug abuse. Schizophrenia is a beast_ but it is truly a mental health condition that can be helped with professional help and medication. Living alone in a sketchy area is probably more dangerous than with a family member.   Other people have made great suggestions already.

It is much more affordable than a regular rental_ and there is still a contract and everything so you are protected if anything happens. You can move in a place as soon as the same week_ depending ofc. But there’s usually plenty of options and all you need to have is first months rent and maybe a security deposit.

Get in contact with homeless services to find out where the food banks are_ and access them. Find out if there are any local churches who give food to people in your situation.  It is better to have four walls_ a locked door_ and a bathroom then to have food and be exposed to the trauma of the street.

Sometimes there is a lttle padding  So most cars lose lots of heat through the roof.  People insulate the windows because it is obvious_ but often they forget about the roof.  Look for sheet styrofoam.  About 3/4 inch thickness is best.  ( The best source of free sheet syrofoam is the dumpster behind a new furniture store )  Place a sheet of it against the roof.  With a sharp knife and a little patience_ you can make it fit.

The water will retain heat from the sun for hours after dark.      Get a prius_ they have a very efficient heat pump and the car can be made so that it turns itself on every now and then just long enough to recharge the batteries then shuts the car off again.     Get serious about your layers. Wool under layers are amazing. Gloves_ hats_ wool socks_ etc. You put enough clothes on and you'll be fine as long as you are out of the wind and rain like in a car.     Get a heated mug. If all your liquid intake is nice and hot that will make it much easier to stay warm_ while also keeping you hydrated.     Get a cover for your car_ put a big blanket under the cover even.     Find an outlet you can park next to and run a small discreet extension cable into the car to power a space heater.     Get a generator and mount it on the back hitch.

You will succeed. Then this will be a cloudy dream from the past that will serve as a reminder that you can and will always do the right thing to succeed.  You will grow to believe and be proud of yourself_ and that is priceless.  Then others will come into your life_ and you will be at a place where you can embrace that as well.  I am praying for you.

j24rqz6,Yes…This World will drive/push honest and caring people over the edge.  What I found most concerning in my Healthcare is that…after leaving one Physician for “pill pushing” I came across other nurses who worked not under that same Doctor_ but another…And were Very Aware of This.   After having experienced the pains and still suffering from lingering side effects of being prescribed medications that were no doubt unnecessary and causing harm…later backed by a Specialist’s medical opinion_ I am in aww at all the health_ time and energy I lost.   It was so much stress. It still is.  Trauma dump…that’s a neat term and hey_ it wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t a need for it.   Look at things this way…I’m 38_ worked for 17 years at the same place_ did military service and deployment_ obtained a Bachelor’s in Education (after like a decade).  Other stories I’ve read…Attorneys_ RN’s and others in healthcare_ many others across different fields in the US….We Are All Having Similar Struggles With The Healthcare System. Why?  I can’t imagine what it’s like going at it from 18 years old_ heck even 25…and trust me 25 is hopefully a lot better!  The hardest thing to do…is learn how to be diplomatic_ if you will.  With Psychiatry…I started reading up on History and Structure…current Director and Past Directors of the National Institute of Mental Health.  Picked up Dr. Thomas Insel’s Audio book_ “Healing_ Our Path From Mental Illness to Mental Health”.  It was enlightening to say the least.  Also_ brushed up on current State lawsuits against select pharmacies.   So_ guess what responses I got from those who where members of my medical in Psychiatry when I asked basic questions relating to what I learned on these points?.  Not talking front desk…I’m talking who’s writing me scripts.  They didn’t know…were not aware of any lawsuits with any pharmaceutical companies_ had no clue who the current director of the NIMH is_ nor any past directors.  I spoke with clinical management…same thing.  This is my experience with the current state of healthcare in the US…it does not appear to be getting better and I am saddened to hear similar stories from many others.  Pro tip: when you’re asked if you have any questions…seems they aren’t happy if you actually have questions…why is that?  Anyhow_ you have to keep things all written down…especially with how the medications you’re prescribed will effect you. It will help greatly to have a consistent person with you at medical appointments and have their notes too.  If an issue comes up…take care of it right away and use what documentation you have to advocate.  You Will Not Be Liked By Staff and The Facility for Doing So_ but…that’s just part of it.  Sometimes_ it comes to a point where you have to seek care from another facility_ find the new one first ( over lap) make sure it’s a good fit_ then discontinue services from previous one.,missfire23,Suspicious_Sound_854,21,2,2,3,1530

j233nud,You should any legal questions you have in r/legaladvice  Why not try to get an overnight custodian (or even daytime if you are okay with that) job for now_ but there are other decent jobs as well that require little social interaction:  https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/jobs-where-you-dont-have-to-deal-with-people  You could try data entry as well_ which doesn’t require a lot of social interaction.   I know it is probably stressful right now and you are junking about a million things at once. I don’t know if you have extreme anxiety or your mental health background_ however YouTube videos and Tiktok videos will help tremendously on those.  You should also try to go to a state where minimum wage is high_ but a town inside of the state where cost of living is low. Washington state is a good choice because it has a high minimum wage and there are some good towns with low cost of living. Check out some of the towns on Areavibes:  https://www.areavibes.com/best-places/washington/cost-of-living/  This website will help you compare different towns based on a lot of different metrics.

j2d3wmk,For RVs_ one simple bathroom convenience. A compost toilet is super simple. One that works as well as any 500 plus model is super easy to make. Look up tiny house compost toilet on youtube or blogs and you'll find both commercial and homemade units_ and a plethora of info. Screw dealing with blackwater waste.  Buddy heaters are what everyone recommends. I do too. Little Buddy's I don't recommend as they're more temperamental than the standard build Buddy heaters.  For lighting_ the oddest thing is that I've used a BALDR 330 watt power pack. I got lucky to get it for 99 dollars at ebay last year. If you use it only as a light_ in a small area like a 8 x 8 room or a van_ will last weeks upon weeks. I've never fully discharged it using light only. So in a small space_ if you only use it for phone or tablet_ and a light you almost need nothing else. For a laptop_ I'd recommend a steady discharge like a Jackery. Laptops should have their own power station. You can go old fashioned and have a small gas generator_ use it once a week to charge two to four marine batteries_ attached cigarette lighter inverters and adapters will power your devices. I did that for a while. You can likely use the single solar to charge small mppt devices like a BALDR or a Jackery. Even stand alone charge controllers are being made with mppt tech these days_ but the power stations have them built in_ and they're fairly cheap. Solar specific wiring and connections are available_ often in kits.  I'd recommend using those to keep your devices a little safer.  Also doesn't hurt to have one or more of [these](https://www.amazon.com/UCO-Original-Lantern-Candles-Yellow/dp/B000F6NNP8?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1)_ with plenty of candle refills. A hurricane style candle seems much safer than a lantern. Both will contribute to heating in small spaces.  If you don't have electricity to operate the water pump_ you retrofit a plunger style on your water tank. if you're lazy like me_ just remove the fresh water tank_ store 5 gallon jugs and use [these.](https://www.ebay.com/itm/132589729106?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110018%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.COMPLISTINGS%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20220920135752%26meid%3De537c4ddfc7d4f07bc94e7f572d72edf%26pid%3D101198%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D12%26sd%3D155292602531%26itm%3D132589729106%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3DItemStripV101HighAdFee%26brand%3DUnbranded&_trksid=p2047675.c101198.m1985&amdata=cksum%3A132589729106e537c4ddfc7d4f07bc94e7f572d72edf%7Cenc%3AAQAHAAABAC6VSE2uGkOxRbBlxpADtEt%252B6nrFsn6dL412bSwepwACVTVX%252BoTQ57irbgQIon20WcHpHd46x5CrmGN6RvXQPvNUOagVuGbdlVBhR643Q6nHpROcfciOybALDUmVrnYxytFmRSfWoqRCxkw9lxHBsmcPIUXmeG0bDhLPF2uZiqVYeNaVUlUExEdtFXDuTPM0GBSfq7eTGpQ0oDxtvsyjaITEzCMK%252F1vl%252BxGji3NodCzf4U07f6xLRBu5AFfuRPgK2jvMoiHYbTKnsxpAyCLXQK9iWIOo0pZzhmD8HPyjvF6iUYd5HqiVodF1DApL8gYiqf%252B6cS%252F2uaGv5BWt%252BIvgWJg%253D%7Campid%3APL_CLK%7Cclp%3A2047675),monos_muertos,Sickologyy,5,3,1,9,1231

I didn't care I went and got my bag anywhere in law and behold realized that some of my stuff was missing.    Another time around Thanksgiving I was at a shelter and they were serving you know basically crappy turkey and it was spoiled and anyone who tried to say anything they threatened with kicking out.   I was at another shelter where they let the police in and these guys were nothing but unprofessional savages waking us all up demanding IDs and basically treating us like crap.  Another shelter I was in The men were made to go into this basement which basically they told us to sleep on the floor and the women were kept upstairs on nice cots and bunk beds later on we found out some of the male staff were exchanging sexual favors so the women can get better treatment.,johnfro5829,Visual-Cream2734,6,5,1,3,1530

I heard someone say once_ ""Every person you see on the street_ they only got there after every single person they knew had failed them.""  As it turns out_ this happens a lot.  Most people choose selfishness.  I had the same thing happen to me with several friends.  I put them up in my homes for months_ or paid their rent_ or spent a year supporting them every week through some difficult life event (divorce_ etc).  When I became homeless_ when I had life difficulties_ they all turned their backs on me.  Most painful revelation in my life by far.  If I have any advice_ it would be to assume most of your friends will respond this way_ and it could be easier to simply avoid them until you're no longer in a state of active need.  That sounds terrible_ I know_ but it may be better than finding out it's more than just this one woman.

One of the illusions of outcome produced by many homeless charities is that they help people prone to vice to shift their inclinations from chemicals to God. The only thing wrong is that 12 steppers often become self righteous and annoying in their new obsession. That's why evangelical churches foster them as potential members and love them when they're doing well. They can be highly intelligent_ but are followers by nature_ incapable of understanding agency on the most abstract level. Followers are vacuums of empathy when they need it but incapable of reciprocating when a once ""source"" or benefactor suffers need. It's something to look out for in the future when those around you try to exploit your empathy again. If you have to discomfort yourself for their comfort_ if you're sacrificing your needs for their wants_ they are parasites_ even if they're family. they need to be the ones cut off.

j1w9e6g,"Honestly it's a tough lesson to learn. Be glad you won't repeat that again. I also had problems with my sister over this_ albeit not homelessness or anything severe. Basically_ I always called her if she wanted food_ or if she wanted anything from the grocery stores. I always think about her or my family_ and what I can buy them or gift them. Now imagine_ I been asking her to buy me some crackers when she's out_ because they are my favorite.   Then_ she gets mad at me for even asking her to buy me things.  Come to find out_ she's been buying those specific crackers and had 2-3 boxes hoarded in her room without my knowledge. I know this isn't as extreme as helping someone repair their life_ but it's still a similar lesson on a smaller scale.   I guess I learned that when you help someone and are generous_ don't expect that they will repeat the favor. It seems obvious and common sense for someone to repay you the same as you've done to them_ but we live in a very selfish world. People have different personalities_ priorities_ beliefs_ and goals that are entirely different from ours.   One thing I would confess on_ is that she sounds like a terrible person to ask for help. I'm a Christian as well_ but that doesn't mean I'll go telling someone ""Your not surrendering something to God_ your not supposed to be comfortable"". I've been on homeless outreaches with the church_ feeding_ praying_ and handing out bibles to people.

Are you on disability or trying to get disability or are you trying to get a job? Finding a job in a rural area is a lot harder than the city.

Have you talked about expectations?  Made it very clear that you have no interest in an exchange that is of adult nature?    If you have their phone number or their name I would definitely do a background check. There are some free background checks where you can get very minimal information about the person for free.  Or even just a Google search for that person's name in that area.

Not because they will provide for me or give me things but to let them know I’m alive and if I seriously need help they can somewhat save me.

As far as food lasting since your in the Philippines_I'm not sure what the weather_but/animal/theiving situation is but you could always ask vendors at the the end of the day if they have anything they couldn't sell they might be getting rid of. Talk to store owners and ask if they maybe need someone for od jobs. Explain your situation and maybe so eine will show some conpassion.

Well_ I started with no skills at all_ I learned everything on the job_ including welding and steel fitting.

I asked a ton of questions when I was on the job.   Well_ I can give you some resources if you change your mind. Even if you can do a little stick welding you could probably get started near me around $30 an hour. It’s not for everyone but getting my foot in the door with shipyard work probably saved me. Personally_ I love it_ and some of them pay $50 an hour plus per diem. but there’s other stuff too. I hate when my company sends me to production jobs and things like that.

j1s4myn,I guess with internet connectivity and social media you're never really far away no matter where you are. I hear you on the robbery and unhinged lurkers at night looking for trouble. I sleep on the urban side_ but I have found a rooftop to sleep on that takes some athletic ability and some practice to get up on without falling to certain injury. Plus if anyone is coming up looking for trouble the whole roof rumbles when someone is climbing up. It would wake me with plenty of time to get the drop on someone. So I sleep okay at night. I'm the only one I know that takes the time to hide when sleeping_ everyone else just passes out wherever when tired and they invite problems IMHO.,snapwired,Liquidmemer,73,1,2,3,1530

j1khpvo,The way i see it_ anything that enables him to have food in his belly and a roof over his head is enabling him - to survive. Dead people don't recover_ and it's really hard to get clean when you're homeless and hungry.   I know it can be hard to know exactly where to draw the line. If he has EBT_ you may be best off paying his rent directly to the landlord and phone bill directly to the company (if you/your mother are so inclined. he's very lucky to have family that cares). If he has food and shelter and a phone_ he's in an excellent position to try and get himself together.,Suckmyflats,wren0in0doubt,11,3,1,8,1024
j1kvsm6,Honestly_ it does sound like you guys are enabling him. I don't personally have a family member that is homeless_ but I do know that homeless people can get free clothes/food from programs or even church outreaches and such. Seems whatever you give him is going towards drugs. STOP giving him money itself. There must come a breaking point where he gets tired and actually wants help. Some addicts just take time to hit that point. The best you can do is keep in contact and remind him how much you love him. You won't help him one ounce feeding his addiction_ he will get the money no matter what_ don't let him have a steady income from you guys.,Sky_hunter,wren0in0doubt,11,3,1,3,1530
j1kw69q,Yea.  Having a backpack pretty much makes you a mark for being homeless.  And yes a store manager WILL LIE TO YOUR MOTHER if that's what it takes to keep someone homeless out of their store.  I've seen and experienced worse.  The general public has no idea the shit we go through.  As a precaution I try to stay out of stores.  I use Amazon lockers & delivery services.,Grassyhobo,wren0in0doubt,11,3,3,11,964

Since I’m aware of the abhorrent level of discrimination in the Public especially “grocery stores across the US and into Canada”…and I’ve already at the least gone as far to share my story with a local shelter administrator.  Why not take it further? There’s an obvious need for a system of checks and balances in this area.  2.) Due to my experiences and such…I’m beginning to wonder if I am somewhat considered to still be a part of the general public?.  My mental health has certainly taken massive hits (continues) since being out of work and things aren’t looking good.,missfire23,wren0in0doubt,11,1,3,3,1530

j1jp8df,I think you can give him the money as long as he talks to you. Basically pay him to keep in touch. I also think that doing drugs is OK but shoplifting is wrong and you must make that clear to him. Doing drugs is no excuse for crime. Encourage him to get a job or go to school.,plidek,wren0in0doubt,11,1,1,11,964
j1kdti9,Tough_ tough spot and really feel a bit uncomfortable even commenting.  If you can afford it then it's at least like you're somewhat helping to keep him alive and going but anyone whose living that way isn't living right. If you can call being on the street living   More like surviving. Youre not going to convince your mom to stop being a mother and painful as it is_ yes I think cutting someone ( even loved one) off can be an only choice.  Take everything away_ they hit rock bottom and only have a couple hard choices left. Change_ get it over with or maybe do something really dumb/desperate and wind up incarcerated.  At least they'd have food_ shelter and a chance to change. You can't save someone from themselves. Think sometimes the issue has to be forced_ a person left w no other choice than do what they must_ either way.  Oops_ another edit. If/when they start making a real and sincere effort to get better. If you still have the energy and resources to want to help ... Cool. Let him know that too.,HauntingCarob6418,wren0in0doubt,11,1,1,3,1530

j1t3enh,It sounds like you may be looking for items to provide to an organization that serves homeless folks to give to people.  If that's the case_ asking the org what they need is best.  I worked with one and sometimes we needed men's underwear_ other times it was cold medicine_ it depended on what was in demand and what we already had.  We never needed socks_ because every school_ scout troop and church collected socks for the homeless.  We had over 2000 pairs of socks at one point_ and every year we'd end up with more than we started.  We handed out a lot of socks...we just got more than we gave out.    One of the most in demand things turned out to be meal bags with a variety of items_ all ready to eat along with plastic utensils and a plate and paper towels.  All bags had a main course item (pop-top beef ravioli_ Vienna sausages_ tuna/chicken kits with crackers)_ Slim Jims_ peanut butter packets_ candy and/or cookies and water and 100% juice boxes_ raisins or applesauce_ pudding cups.,adlpated,PaleRequirement79,5,2,1,3,1530
j1l0f8q,There was no judgement expressed in the OP_ they just said they didn’t want to give money. They never said they didn’t think homeless people could be trusted with cash and they didn’t say they were concerned that cash would be spent frivolously.   There are plenty of reasons why someone might want to give something other than cash. Some people just don’t like giving cash as a gift_ some people feel like it’s impersonal_ utilitarian.

I happily spent money on insulating my car and went that route for what I had anticipated would be 2 maybe 3 weeks. The deal fell through and it became months with no end in sight.

j1jcpst,"From what I noticed in the location I am in. The only time I see somewhat ""afforadble"" motels are when you go in towns/cities that not a plethora of individuals are locating too. The places that are not known for tourism_ or have a booming industry of some sort. But this comes off with a significant trade off because most of the times (from my experience and observations) these places lack sufficient opportuntites and resources because of a lack of individuals coming into these places.    It is somewhat of a no win situation in certain places.   Motels in these places are also rising over the past year alone. I had a coworker at a former job in May of this year who was living in a local motel who raised their prices from approximately $750ish per month_ to around $900ish I believe. It is insane because just several years ago_ you could have rented motels in my hometown for only $650ish a month.   For example_ if you live in a big city such as Seattle_ then the motel prices will be off the charts. But if you live somewhere like Mount Pleasant MI a place where not many people know of_ the motel prices would be significantly lower than in bigger cities_ however the lack of opportuntities there is possibly why people do not go to towns such as that.",Markie199711,cupcakiee,3,1,1,3,1530

j1i208y,I think the most helpful think you can do is to get to know one unhoused individual. Sit down with them where they are or invite them to meet you for lunch or coffee (if you’re a bit wary and want others around). Ask them what would be helpful - clothes? Shoes? A gas card? Help getting an ID? Or if you sense that they have untreated mental illness or addiction_ research places that can help and if they are willing_ help them jump through the administrative hoops to access those resources. If they are unwilling_ try to continue to develop a friendship with them. Be a support_ a person they can talk to_ and someone they can go to when they are ready to move forward. Definitely set boundaries (never give anyone cash)_ and be discerning as to who you give rides to. But I would say that one of the main causes of homelessness is isolation from healthy family_ friends and folks who can help - and we can all work to do something about that 🙂.,pppches,saprobic_saturn,9,4,1,11,964

j1kx27h,You’re on the right track and asking good questions.  I suppose it’s different for everyone: time_ schedule_ safety_ area_ what resources are available_ who’s with you etc.  I’m middle aged_ unhealthy_ small male. Still_ I’ve learned that it’s easy to cause someone to panic if you approach them…so I don’t do that anymore.   You just don’t know what someone has been through and in hindsight after being on here…enough…pretty sure the guy got his stuff stolen from him recently_ which would explain why he was carrying what little he had in his shirt.   Pretty much I just kinda let things unfold as natural as possible. I’ll give a warm greeting and what not and sometimes a conversation follows_ sometimes not.  If you end up talking_ you get a chance to ask what is needed and if you can bring it by or in some cases drop it safely.,missfire23,saprobic_saturn,9,2,1,3,1530
j1lqbdm,"Your heart is definitely in the right place_ particularly this being Christmas and all. When I (42 year old man with cerebral palsy) used to work for a homeless services organization_ I certainly could have been taken advantage of_ even as it was my city; an area I am all too familiar with. The fact that I wasn't meant two things to me: first_ that the homeless human beings that I encountered were appreciative of my assistance and 2: realize that had taken advantage of me_ they may not have been helped as they were.  I said all of that to say that homeless individuals do get a bad rap; most are just trying to get by_ like you and I. The difference being that the streets are tough: That's where the development of ""street smarts"" comes in.  Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen or something. And you might find out that a large contingent of that population hangs out at the local McDonald's or the local library at around this or that time. Maybe you bring your boyfriend along. So you go to the library and find a way to strategically Introduce yourself. I say it's strategically_ because you need to be safe and careful. But once you've got an ""in_ just talking about their experience is helpful. They want to be seen, just like everybody else. All of this is predicted on your own personal safety being paramount. If you don't feel safe, you might want to try a different approach.

ztz5x6,j1gut6s,,Good to know that's what people are looking for! Trying to make kits to hand out to people, rn 1 kit is 2 thermacare heat wrap packs (couldn't find hot hands), an emergency blanket, 2 packets of self heating camping food w utensils, 2 water bottles (to activate the food heating), and wool socks. Wondering if there's anything else good to add. Also trying to find the best places to hand stuff out, I feel like maybe good spots to check would be bus stations and in front of grocery stores as those are currently the only spots I've run into people who can use the kits... I dunno though. It sucks people are having to try to survive in this. I'm worried : (  Also. Props to you op!!!
ztz5x6,,j1i47go,It will be closed today and tomorrow (and maybe Monday), but public libraries are a good place to find us.
ztz5x6,j1gk1bc,,I hand out handwarmers doing outreach, and it's my most requested item. That and emergency blankets. People really need and appreciate them. I usually get several boxes either donated or I buy them in bulk every month, along with passing them out, I take a bunch to the local low income clinic, and two church's with free boxes outside their building.  I just wish there was more I could do, like advocate to the city to get more shelter options available, because up til recently, there were no shelters whatsoever here
ztz5x6,j1imgl1,,Good to know what homeless needs most.
ztz5x6,,j1kmigm,Socks. Don't get the cheapest ones, because they're thin and not at all durable. But don't go crazy and get really expensive ones, either; better six pairs of good-enough socks than one or two pairs of fancy ones.  Given the limits to how much stuff I can have, I often wear the same clothes for a few days. But I change my socks at least once a day.

I got lucky. I’m doing really good now. There are jobs in Phoenix. Employers are desperate for employees who will show up. It’s really nice in Phoenix.

zty42w,j1hggx1,,There are two gudjuwaras in Connecticut. They have phone numbers and it's likely they'd help you stay warm and fed, including getting there and parking up, because that's their thing. It's one avenue of help that you haven't mentioned yet, so...  Any non-leaking container that you can fill with hot water and wrap in a towel is a survival tool. Also, if you can get paper, crumple it up and shove it inside your shoes and clothes. Keep your head covered at all times. Wearing a mask will warm the air that you're breathing in, so you lose less. Keep hydrated. You need nearly as much water as if it was really hot - keep your urine straw-coloured, not too pale (or you'll go more often and lose more heat). You need that water to burn fat to stay warm. You also need any calories you can get.  Beg people for coffee, not money for coffee. Hot drinks will also help you keep alive. Ask for hot water too, to fill whatever you're using as a hot water bottle. You probably look like shit with the health problems and anxiety, so nobody is going to want to give cash the way they will if you look healthier, which is just the catch-22 you're stuck in.  However much you can move without collapsing entirely, move that much. If you start shivering and can't get under more cover/insulation you have, then you don't have long left to live and you can either die in your car or ditch it for the ER to not, you know, die. So get mentally ready for life getting even worse than it already did. Let's hope it doesn't.

zty42w,,j1g5kdv,Well at least you would have some warmth for a while.  Idk maybe you need to say different things.  I always ended up in the hospital after saying im gonna kill myself.  Maybe you need to cut yourself a little.   Sorry to say that. Its fucked up but hey you cant just freeze to death.
zty42w,,j1g68bm,Warmth while being locked with people who wanna rip your head off and forced to take meds you really don't need. If I cut myself they restrain me (handcuffs you name it all). No showers, you piss and crap on yourself they don't care. That won't work honestly
zty42w,,j1ijgyq,Don’t cut yourself wth. 🤦‍♀️ Hospitals by law have to take you in… go to the hospital for your health issues and while you’re there tell them you need resources ASAP so that you don’t freeze to death. They can likely find you some kind of alternative.

zty42w,j1vwnth,,This is capitalism. I just saw that many froze to death in Buffalo but, the msm is only counting deaths not saying how the narcissism and cruelty of this system is responsible.  They hide the deaths and real reasons for them.  Homeless are going to die enmasse as even the system supposedly to help the homeless is middlemen consultants and those scumbags peeling off much of the tiny available funds to enrich themselves.  This system is broken and killing its citizens while sending money for their war overseas and pretending to have done everything they can.  Pure Evil.    Im sorry we as a country are too narcissistic to do more than pray.  The lack of actual empathy mixed with apathy and the desperation of the rest too destroyed to even attempt to help anyone else is growing.   We normalized narcissism part is that we wont acknowledge problems until they hit us and then there is no one to help us. Even the narcissism of the masses is very much from being victimized by a predatory system of greed.  The narcissism begets more narcissism.   Weve failed as a country and have just begun the decent.

zty42w,,j1imz8a,I was very lucky to live in a place with a ton of homeless support. I once had my sleeping bag stolen, I left it for like a minute.

I will forever care about the homeless though. My friends are still on the street.

zty42w,j1hdhuz,,There's other forums on reddit for people who're straight up just asking for money, which is what this is.  You're getting to the point you're being openly hostile to any advice, and there's many solutions that will work, at least well enough to get you through the night.    &#x200B;  Also, you DO have to have some sense when you're homeless, you can't wait until you're in an extremely dangerous situation to be planning your move.  You should, barest minimum, have an appropriate sleeping bag, winter clothing, and blankets for the situation.    It sounds like you have a car so you should have been panhandling to get your ass either to Florida, South Arizona, or South Cali \*MONTHS AGO\*!  I'm aware that you're overdue on car payment and insurance payment, but still getting somewhere warm should take high priority over everything else.    &#x200B;  I've watched you go from indifferent reasons to why these ideas won't work, to hostile about why these ideas won't work, all the way to OPENLY hostile about why these ideas won't work and saying that money is the only the solution"".  You're begging.  And the general tone sounds a lot like begging to feed a severe drug addiction.  You think us people who've done time homeless haven't seen that before?  It's pretty obvious once you've seen it a few times.  Go to the crowdfund or assistance forums.  Be more polite and more grateful on them.  You go using this tone and no one will give you a damn thing because you're sounding like a crackhead who needs a rock.  &#x200B;  If you aren't begging for a fix_ I apologize for saying that_ but you can't wait until the deep cold to leave cold frozen winter states.  You should have got somewhere warm by early November.  Poor planning when you're homeless_ can and will_ result in death.  You're gonna have to be smarter about things.",GeekDE,saprobic_saturn,9,1,1,3,1530
j1hrp77,I second your opinion. OP's tone is just... something is off. The only time OP had anything nice to say was when they mentioned someone gave them money on r/mustang. Big red flag there. Seems like OP is getting frustrated that people are handing out advice instead of cash app. It's literally the first rule of this sub_ do not give ppl money here. I'm not sure about it being for drugs tho.  All that being said_ is this really how bad the services are in the US? I'm homeless in Canada. This is my 2nd month. I have a bed that's reserved for me as long as I show up by a certain time. There is at least 1 meal a day from the churches. The shelter usually does a light snack for breakfast. Donated clothes. Donated toiletries. I get a small stipend from the province. Housing in about 6 months. Applying for disability.  If this is the typical situation in the US_ I'm really sorry you have to go through that. Take care everyone.,Faketrees2223,KatieAdams2020,101,9,2,3,1530
j1hxmyg,It depends on where you are in the nation how good the service will be to the homeless.  In some areas (usually Republican controlled areas)_ help is virtually non existent.  Some areas have a fairly extensive help network_ which also results in attracting much more homeless in that region.  Though I don't know anywhere in the US that sounds quite as good as what you have.  I don't know of any \*safe\* (key word) shelters that just has a reserved bed every night ready to go.    &#x200B;  It sounds like OP is in a particularly bad area for government help for the homeless.  It also sounds to me like she has exhausted all her friends/relatives who will lend her money (people are always much more eager to help homeless women than men_ that's why you see far less homeless women).  So since she's not used to the hoops you have to jump through to get help from the government and charities_ she's just asking for money.  If she wants to be homeless_ for long_ she's gonna have to move somewhere warm where the government helps the homeless more.  South California is a popular choice.

j1izf46,“Go see if they really mean what they preach” this is the actual answer. Don’t call them_ show up. Find a church in your area_ go to Sunday service. Leave your pride at the door. A Unitarian service would be my choice…  Christmas falls on a Sunday this year_ so there’s a pretty good chance church’s will be serving a potluck lunch. You should be able to find this out by looking at the church’s calendar online. Humbly stand up in front of the congregation and explain to them your situation. Churches themselves may be low on funding_ but the entire body of the church is not.   The shame of not helping you in an open forum_ will overwhelm any reservations about not providing you assistance. Trust me this will work.

j1h43vd,It sounds like it's time to leave that place_ but to do that_  you need to stay alive and you need funds. Please seek out any public place you can to get out of the cold. The Red Cross has warming centers during really harsh times. But you need money too. If Doordash is out_ can you make content on your phone? Videos_ blogs_ a video journal on YouTube about your life and what you're going through? Enough subscribers could turn everything around for you.  Collect donations via PayPal? Could you get a Patreon account? Heck_ I might even do foot fetish videos if I really needed the money! When I was in my 20s I worked as a life drawing model at a community college to make ends meet and from there l got a lot of local artists as clients_ who paid cash each session. I won't say it was easy money_ but it's a venerable old job and I was rather proud to see some of the work that came from it. For that_ I literally just walked in and gave the woman who ran the art department my name and number. Best go through someone like that and stay safe- don't Craigslist it or anything like that! It's not for everyone_  but if you don't mind being nude for art_ it can keep you alive. Not sure if you can donate plasma or not_ but a number of folks on here do that to get fast cash. The key thing is finding strength from somewhere_ finding out what you can offer_  and not giving up. You never know what's next or how your life might change.

When I began to c homelessness in the near future because I was getting evicted_ it was too late to change.

I was in between jobs because of health issues(cancer) and was only receiving disability. My roommate had stopped paying the landlord for about 6 months before I found out. They had been hiding the eviction notices from me. Refused to pay me back the rent I paid to them. I couldn't afford anything else so I just sort of ended up loosing a lot of belongings because my aunt was negligent with stuff she promised to let me keep at her house(she dropped off with my estranged father who did God knows what with it). Lost all my belongings a couple times just from visiting the hospital. Once I had a medical emergency on the train and the transit police didn't give my belongings to the paramedics that took me to the hospital. For some reason the cops emptied my pockets and backpack while I was unconscious.

j1k66pr,My wife left me_ and I lost the will to live. Without her_ there is no beauty in the world. Food has no taste and music is just noise. My live truly has no meaning or purpose. I am broken beyond what words can describe.  The day she had the divorce papers served_ I was working from home. It was a Friday. I finished up my call_ closed my laptop_ and never signed in again. My whole world collapsed.  I was an IT consultant. I made over $100k per year. I’m not bragging_ I’m just giving the facts. I traveled Monday through Thursday to various parts of the US every week for work. And I gave it all up without a second thought.  I lived in my car for a while. Drove around the country. For some people_ that would have been exciting_ but for me_ I was just driving. I hardly remember any of it. I was just driving each day_ and sleeping in the trunk of my car each night_ hoping for a miracle. But that miracle never came.  I lived in my car for awhile. Then_ after a month of freezing my ass of in Minnesota_ I stayed in hotel rooms for a couple of months (using the “hotel points” that I had accumulated working as a traveling consultant). Eventually_ I got an apartment and spent a year sleeping on a yoga mat and living life through my phone. And when my money began to run out_ I became homeless.  I’m currently living in a small bivvy tent just outside Tulsa_ Oklahoma. I have enough money to eat_ but that won’t last forever.  I have nowhere to turn for help. My family is extremely toxic and devoid of love. My friends are either screwed up in their own ways_ or they have this own lives. I’m sure I could go to them if I had a plan_ but I don’t. I just want to do nothing_ forever.  I am exhausted beyond words. I just lay in my tent all day. Sometimes I walk to the nearest convenience store to get some food. Sometimes I’m too exhausted to even look at my phone. I just want to sleep forever. I don’t want to be here anymore.  I’m a good person. I don’t do drugs or drink. I don’t even drink caffeine (because it triggers my anxiety). I don’t steal. I’m not violent. I try to be kind to everyone I meet_ even when I’m hurting inside. I made mistakes in the past_ but years of introspection have helped me to understand the root cause of those bad behaviors so that I never repeat them again. I just want to be loved. I just want to be with my wife again.  Before you judge me to harshly_ please consider this: We all experience the emotion of love in different ways_ and we all experience loss in different ways. Some people will be sad for just a day or two_ some will be broken for a few months and then slowly recover_ and some - like me - will be utterly and completely broken.,Darkness_Deluxe,speedwaysghost,20,2,1,3,1530

Can also work as mittens in a pinch.  Used to get bulk packs and put 2 pair in a zip lock bag. People would turn down food_ but always took socks.,samtresler,Material-Ad-8289,2,2,1,3,1530

j1dxwzu,I live in Winnipeg so to me I’d be sleeping in shorts and a t shirt with a 5$ fleece blanket for 8-10/12 months a year if I was in Texas  We get to -20 for over a months worth of days every year. Last winter we had over half a month of days below -30   Wool Socks. Balaclava as it covers the one part exposed that usually isn’t: the face Thermal underwear  Mitts if things Gets below 0 to -5   Depending on weather and their situation  Emergency blanket_ another blanket or even a sleeping bag. Any are good  I’m summer we have to deal with keeping Hydrated to stay safe   In the winter it’s the opposite You don’t want to be dehydrated but you don’t sweat much/anything out and the more water in your system the more energy your body will use to keep your pee warm_ because water inside your body that isn’t heated would freeze people to death or give hypothermia pretty quickly in freezing temps. Inside or on the skin surface.   Again depending  On situation_ a heated blanket or a heater and extension cord if they have shore power.    Hot meals like Soup or something warm especially when warm liquid really feels nice on the insides.,FlyingTerrapin71,Material-Ad-8289,2,1,1,8,1024
j1f90uk,My homeless friend had shoes taped together with duct tape last time I saw him_ I took him and his gf to get new pairs and some warm socks. They say it’s what they go through the most with all the walking. They also said Sweaters_ windbreaking jackets and other wearables that can be layered for Christmas would be nice. Things that are easy to carry and light_ and that they can easily throw in their backpack or cart.,AnnaBear6,Material-Ad-8289,2,1,1,3,1530
j1c3kck,In the United States the resources available to homeless people vary a *lot* from state to state_ even from county to county_ or city to city. Some resources are provided by the government_ sometimes resources are available through non profit organizations. The eligibility for different resources varies too; sometimes you need to be referred in order to access certain resources.   The only thing that seems mostly universal that is available to *most* people in *most* states is EBT or food stamps. The amount you can get and how long you can get them varies a lot though. The fact that there isn’t a simple_ universal set of benefits that all homeless people can receive is one of the reasons it can be so hard trying to get help.   I have no idea how it compares to aid for immigrants_ I’m not at all familiar with that.,MrsDirtbag,oakstreetgirl,14,9,1,3,1530
j1jsanw,"Texas here: unless you are working 20hrs/wk or can prove you have a disability_ you only get 3mos of SNAP/foodstamps every THREE YEARS. Many homeless adults have psych or substance issues and they can't navigate the paperwork. To make it worse_ the Texas Department of Health and Human Services is running MONTHS behind. Those who should qualify for emergency benefits (within 24hrs) are left in the cracks. There is weird legislation with the pandemic but many programs are AVAILABLE but not funded. So_ I've seen a domestic violence shelter turning away families when they had space available. The Texas Attorney General messed up and put a garnishment on my disability benefits (not uncommon) for child support when my children have separate benefits through the federal government and it's been preventing me from qualifying for ""public housing"" because my monthly income is more than $0 but less than the SSI amount for indigent disabled. This is happening to veterans_ too. Working means losing medical benefits (Medicaid pays my Medicare co-pays and deductible and premiums) and my 20% would have been more than I can feasibly earn.   My suicide attempt would have been ~$80K for my portion. I wanted to die but I'm too valuable as a conduit of federal dollars to for-profit healthcare. They went to extremes to bring me back to life_ court order me to inpatient treatment and then release me to a homeless shelter. I wish I were kidding.",I_Want_A_New_Life_,oakstreetgirl,14,1,1,3,1530
j1e0dti,As someone that just started working in housing it is extremely confusing (for no good reason). I'll try to break this down without jargon: every region/city/state is responsible for setting up a non-profit that annually submits a single grant application on behalf of all homeless service providers in the area. This organization is also responsible for collecting data about individuals and families experiencing homelessness within their area_ which is submitted with that application to justify the funding requests. There are a lot of ways this approach fails the same people it is supposed to serve:  - Most of the providers are non profits_ not government agencies. This means that there's pretty low compliance with all parts of the process_ from collecting accurate data - through to actually delivering the services promised. And no one to really hold them accountable because...  - The lead agency is also a non profit_ not a government agency. Most are chronically ill equipped to enforce the stipulations of the grant funding.  - There's no formal way to create more providers in an area if they are deemed necessary. This means lots of places have patchy services_ often run by religious groups that use discriminatory practices.  To me (who's only been working for a lead agency for about 4 months) this feels super hands-off and ineffective for such a serious problem. On that note_ the federal government does provide a LOT of funding opportunities if the lead agency can get their shit together and keep providers in compliance. Most don't discriminate between citizens_ refugees_ or immigrants (legal or otherwise) when they offer services... but there are some specialized providers_ especially if there is a high need in the area.   Most places will have...  - domestic violence shelters for women and children (hopefully men too but it's less common) - veterans services (us armed forces only) - overnight emergency shelters for various populations - permanent supportive housing projects for individuals with disabilities - rapid rehousing projects to help place recently evicted folks into empty housing units - temporary housing projects with various types of social services built into the program to help folks achieve stability - outreach programs that run various kinds of drop in centers or travel around to do street outreach. - some places also have refugee resettlement agencies (mine has these_ including agencies that help folks who've been trafficked.)  If you want to learn more about these_ check out the HUD Exhange: https://www.hudexchange.info/. You're free to DM me too if you have more questions_ and I'll do my best to answer them.,the__mom_friend,oakstreetgirl,14,3,1,3,1530
j1e3804,In what country? Crossing what border? Here in Sweden you have to be drug free to get any help more or less_ but once you are you can get both shelter and apply for your own apartment eventually,artonion,oakstreetgirl,14,2,1,3,1530
j1etemq,I've been thinking of a homeless app on and off for years now. I may combine it with a fun charitable app I had in mind_ but will need more resources,Acceptable-Spot4705,oakstreetgirl,14,2,1,3,1530
j1g5uk3,There’s also a huge gap between what is or might be available and what folks are actually able to access. I consider myself a lot more aware than many of what resources exist (I’ve been disabled and impoverished for many years_ homeless the last 7 months.) and I’ve repeatedly been in situations where the social worker or case manager whose job it is to help me isn’t even aware of the programs I’m informing them exist.   It’s actually accessing those resources that’s the problem. I’ve had so dang many issues with all manner of problems and incompetence with the Department of Human Services. Like mistakes made on their end. At least with DHS you eventually get some level of response. I’ve found many places that offer aid don’t even return calls or do the things they say they will.   I’m well aware of things that exist that could help me tremendously. I just can never seem to actually access them. And just about any time I’ve ever managed to access any benefit- even including my social security disability- I figured it out entirely on my own and did it with no help. It’s wild how many times people whose job it is to help don’t manage to get me anywhere at all. And often_ good luck even accessing the case manager or benefits coordinator or whatever in the first place.   That’s what I see as the biggest problem of all. I can’t know for sure what it’s like for immigrants or refugees and such but it seems like there’s always so many people willing to help those folks navigate their options. I’ve seen a lot of local community and religious based organizations be allowed focused on immigrants while having no resources to help their own community members access similar services and help.,Tzipity,oakstreetgirl,14,2,1,3,1530

We said we needed toilet paper and water and …  we reported the animals_ the scorpions in there. There were scorpions_ ants_ ticks_ fleas and they would tell us that it was fine_ it was because of our own stink of being there 45 days.”  At least in most homeless shelters in the US_ you are not shoved in a cramped cell and forced to wallow in a layer of shit and insects.,Lapamasa,oakstreetgirl,14,1,5,9,1231

j1d2cyw,Well I guess we need a good sense of humor to read it then. My dad wrote a lot and some of his writing is as a character with his memories but the voice of this guy named Tony. He grew up poor in a family of 11 including his parents and joined the police department when he met my moms family who were all police. He did it for 20 years then went out on a mental disability. He started his own chimney sweeping business where he mostly did restaurants and some houses. He would wear a big black top hat like they did in the 1800-1900's. Sometimes would make me embarrassed. I would give anything now to see that ridiculous hat. There were so many people at his funeral and wake showed me how much of an impact he had.

j16xrd5,Would this be a for-profit or non-profit? Two really big differences. Each one has complications and a complex structure and making it actually happen. Do a lot of research on what kind of permits you would need as a for-profit and a non-profit. Look at other organizations that does something similar_ even if it's a non-profit. As a non-profit_ you would be required to have a board of directors that is one of the requirements for an official non-profit organization. For a non-profit it would open you up to grants and sponsorships. But the same can be true for for profit. But a for profit business organization cannot apply to a non-profit grant. And vice versa for the non-profit. I like the concept but make sure to do your research.,Antique_Radish8823,MillenialMatriarch,0,2,1,3,1530

j19ke6h,The issues you’re dealing with are exactly why a lot of us steer clear of shelters. Winter camping is certainly do-able as long as you have decent gear. One of the most important things that is often overlooked is to put some insulation or padding underneath you. The ground is the biggest thief of warmth. I always scrounged pieces of carpet from the dumpster of a flooring store and placed it under my tent as well as on the floor of the tent. On top of that put a mattress or sleeping pad. I always got nice mattresses from the curb in nice areas_ they’re a pain to haul but you only have to do it once.,MrsDirtbag,Faketrees2223,4,2,1,3,1530

j153qo4,I know your local shelter will have information on fostering while you stay at a shelter (I haven't been to many that allow animals). Fostering is just a temporary measure_ someone looks after your pets until you are able to secure housing. As for that_ look into your local resources through findhelp.org and calling 211. Not going to lie_ san Diego_  much like most of CA_  is running low on resources so be sure to call up your local churches as well.  Good luck!,ladyinatent,beokie,5,4,1,3,1530
j1ebprb,There are many SRO’s that you could afford as well as Independent Living Facilities. Contact PATH People Assisting The Homeless and get a caseworker. The number is online. There is a shelter downtown run by Alpha Project. It’s called a bridge shelter. Call them and see if they have beds. San Diego is also opening a hotel downtown and turning the rooms into a shelter for seniors. I believe it’s opening right after the new year. There is also a shelter on the grounds of the County Psychiatric Facility in the Midway District. There is a shelter in East County called East County Transitional Living. All of these accept pets. But you have to register your dog as an emotional support animal. If you call the shelter they will tell you what websites you can use. You are basically buying a fake certification but I think it’s for the shelters liability. Good luck. You can message me if you have any questions. Oh and of course apply for Cal Fresh and Medi Care by calling 211. They can get you approved on the spot.,Western-Cucumber9851,beokie,5,3,1,8,1024

j16suts,My friends good friend house went on fire. The Red Cross was supposed to help her with her Cat that she raised as a kitten and was rescued. They hadn't helped her or her tenant.  I went to the blessing of the animals in 2017 around the same time this happened. I meet a_ woman in a Shelter with two dogs. She said they live there with her in the Shelter. I looked for resources for shelters prior to meeting this woman. I could not find any shelter that allowed animals except Domestic Violence Victims.  If you get Service Animal Certified for your Dog_ and Emotional Support Animal for Your Cat_ by Law the Shelter cannot discrimate.. However in California_ I am told that there is a waiting list to get into a Shelter. Your best bet is to take out a_ loan and buy a easy towable tiny house. They are as low as $35_000 for an off grid and fully equipped with water caught system. They can be towed with most any car. Very low weight bearing. You can then buy a job. They have places that will take the first weeks pay as satisfaction for finding you a job. You can also do canning. Collecting cans and bottles and cashing them in. Set up you stand to sell interesting items you find_ of course after cleaning them up.  Remember without housing you really can't be effective. You can't work contribute to society_ or even help yourself. Incredible Tiny Homes have a product called an In-Cred-I Box. For sixteen feet_ you get a complete home. They even have financial information to help you buy the house.  Being homeless and a senor citizen is a bitter life. It means a very shorten life span. Aggravation_ and humiliation. Getting out of that situation means getting up and going ready for action before it is too late.,Internal-Ad-9390,beokie,5,1,1,3,1530

They also pay for vet care and kennels. They also have resources on their website and you can call them and speak to someone about any resources for you. They are open 9-5pm M-F and remember time difference from wherever you are.

There are normally a LOT of things you can get for free or greatly reduced_ but its hard to sniff out where you have to go to get them. A local shelter or community outreach center probably has a great masterlist of resources in your area :)  There's no shame in explaining your situation or using community resources_ they're literally there for YOU :),leftHandWheel,Dangerous_Ad_8909,9,1,2,3,1530

This will help a lot with saving money that could go towards finding a place/bills.   - Search up Restaurants_ maybe you could find a job being a dishwasher. They are always looking from what my friends say.   - Try to see if you can apply to Uber or Door-Dash on a bicycle if you can.   - Try maybe a Skateshop maybe someone wil take you in.   - I don’t know how recycling cans works in your country but you could recycle cans from hotspots around town or city with a full covered mask on to cover your identity.

j16q5r3,Start a Go Fund Me Page from the Go Fund Me App_ and get everyone who knows you involved with the App. Buy a Tiny House Trailer that can sleep a lot of people or else a small house that can sleep a lot of people. Also stop acting out. Don't make a bad situation worse. I was homeless as a child. I told my friends. They couldn't help me. When you are young there is hope However_ when you get in your middle years_ and older and become homeless it is a disaster. You can't recoup as well. Youth is on your side and hope. Older folks don't have that much hope after being homeless for decades. Getting housed is left to some_ who will work day in and out_ even a few hours a day to find resources. Go Fund Me is the last resort when all else fails.,Internal-Ad-9390,Dangerous_Ad_8909,9,1,1,3,1530

j15mdph,Unfortunately I think you are right but it’s not limited to sports it’s a nationwide issue that effects many interests and demographics. But yeah we are neighbours and some of that sounds similar to Canada. You avoid some of that right wing ignorant BS and it’s replaced with some non sensical Socialist views from a government who wants it run entirely through them to the point they gatekeeper peoples ideas so that it can’t pass and then they just do it themselves. Bureaucracy at its finest lol. It’s socialist but wants everything run through the government so it’s authoritarian.  That’s why so many Americans seem to like PP(Pierre polievre) the Conservative party leader  He’s not so ignorant right for the most part_ but condemns a lot of the left wing actions like the “woke movement” the mismanaging of funds and overpayments to liberal tied organizations and friends   He’s still got a few real ignorant way right views but to compare to the ignorant right views in the states he’s not far right at all. I’m voting Con this time around because I hate Trudeau and he’s done a poor job and Pierre is left enough for a right winger that I agree with a lot of his views being that I’m fairly central on the spectrum.   But yes greed is the main issue people in our spot face right now.

Maybe a gun pass or regal movie theater unlimited pass so he has a place to keep warm… you can watch movie after movie with the regal pass… 🤷🏻‍♀️  I’m currently letting my mother in law sleep in the car but unfortunately she isn’t greatful for the help and also won’t let me use my own car when I need it for work…very selfish but I am enabling her less and less… use to bring her cooked meals and we sent her resume to jobs for her and si she is working now. She is a lousy worker but the cold nights in the car is helping motivate her to work and become self sufficient.

One question. Is it possible to try to force him into conservatorship under your family so that you can have him put into a temporary mental health facility in hopes that he will learn that he must help himself?   As someone else suggested. Give him a tent_ blankets & also resources and let him hit rock bottom. Unfortunately do not allow him to stay with your family.

You will find out how disciplined he will become. Even with his thoughts and behavior. Holding on to someone and controlling them can make you sick and him sicker. At some point_ he will have to be the person who realizes he needs_ help and make_ his_ own discussion to help himself. Not owing anyone money_ looking out for himself and living his own life ends up being way better than folks hanging on to him.

j1280r2,No idea…I’ve wondered the same thing while both being the one shopping while parking in the far back amongst all the empty spaces and also sleeping…never fails…someone will pull right up next or right behind.  I’ve always had the habit of parking in the back like this. It’s always easier for me to load up my vehicle without worry of being blocked in on either side.,missfire23,Antique_Radish8823,3,3,1,3,1530
j113w7x,If could be an employee who has to park in the back of the lot. If it's a shopper_ it's probably someone who doesn't want their car to get nicked or dinged by other cars or shoppers_ who is trying to get more walking into their day_ or who wants to make a fast exit from the parking lot.

j0zx0ba,You can ask questions about food stamps in the sub for food stamps! Luckily there are people who work in that department on reddit. Some states require residency. To use tx as an example_ Google will say you have to be here for a year to be a resident_ but in the food stamps sub I was told that if a person arrives today with the intent to stay here_ that is sufficient for their purpose_ but warned me it might be better to get food stamps where you are and then transfer them. Because of differing rules from state to state. Tx doesn't let non disabled people have them for more than three months unless you work at least 20 hours or engage in workforce activity for 20 hours_ and we're not the only state with such rules.

j11cupw,Oh ok_ that makes sense. I got off the streets about 2 years ago as well but my apartment is in SJ so I’m still around. I have a lot of friends who are still on the street. Even just in those 2 years things have gotten a lot worse. There’s so many of us now and the normies are out of patience and sympathy. I feel like the non profits that are supposed to help us aren’t managing their resources very well. Plus the high cost of living here makes it almost impossible to get off the streets without government aid or subsidized housing. It’s not the worst place you could be_ but it’s far from easy mode.

j12lbs6,The Best Place to go to if you are homeless is New York City. Their is a limited supply of Middle Class people. The fight to keep people poor and on Welfare is a big Deal that no one talks about. Just find an intake Shelter and then after two weeks your are assigned a Shelter which has Case Managers.  New York does not supply much housing. They mostly have shelters. They call these shelters housing. Most folks don't take New York seriously for permanent housing. They boost about home ownership and reaching homeownership goals. Don't bet on it.  Consider it a temporary place until you get a foothold into a state that provides real housing opportunities. Beware of cliches about housing opportunities. It's all just talk.,Internal-Ad-9390,SnooWalruses762,9,1,1,3,1530

j13gw1q,He's using an old stone foundation as a backstop and put up a wind block opposite of the foundation. Fire goes in between the backstop and windbreak_ he sleeps between fire and backstop. Fire heats up the stone wall and radiates it back to him. He has a few tarps above backstop for rain shelter but it doesn't go far enough out from backstop to be over the fire. His site is in the woods along the river just outside of town and it's a short walk into the downtown area. Benefit of being around a small town_ but the big downside is complete lack of social services.  I've tried to help him get his shit together but he gets a place for awhile then fucks it up over stupid and petty shit and ends up back in the woods. I tried explaining he can have an apartment *and* still go camping if that's where he really wants to be most of the time. What worries me the most is he's *not* an outdoorsman_ hardly knows anything about bushcraft and refuses to read up on it or even watch YouTube videos to learn. His campsite was set up by another friend who was worried he'd freeze to death a few years ago and that site just sits there unused until he needs it again. If for whatever reason he was run off from that spot he wouldn't be able to build anything similar. I don't want to give up on him even if he seems to have given up on himself. Just can't get through to him and I'm just waiting for the local convenience store manager to text me she hasn't seen him in a few days as an indication something is seriously wrong.,BoneHugsHominy,Vagabond2805,33,2,2,3,1530

By next Wed it'll be back up to 60_ Thursday it'll be nearly 70_ and will remain about 70 day and night through the weekend. A couple more cold nights_ each a little warmer than the one before. Of course_ there's no such thing as a free ride_ and all that warm weather culminates into rain beginning Friday_ non stop to midday Sunday. But then again_ that's a week away.

j11gmum,In most states your own insurance covers the damage if the other driver had inadequate or no insurance (its called underinsured and noninsured coverage). Your insurance company will then sue the other driver. It is called subrogation...you are giving your right to sue him to your insurance company. When you call your insurance company_ give them his complete name and address_ any other information they need. Do not contact the guy. Do not go to see him_ even if he invited you. You have insurance agents that represent you and that is their job. You do nothing except report the incident to your insurer_ and take your car to the shop. Ask your insurance company if they will cover a rental vehicle for you. Mine did when my car was in the shop.  Edit: And I'm sorry this happened and you're not having good luck.

j0z7mtb,They really have no choice where to stay. There are States that do not tolerate immigrants even Asylum Seekers. Under federalism_ and the right of each state to police itself_ each state can make its own laws with regards to tolerance for illegal immigrants and Asylum Seekers. If an asylum Seeker is not granted immunity_ being returned to their country_ they can still find a way to live in a state that does not Deport them back to their country. Life is not always Fair_ the course may not Grant some people immunity from deportation under the same circumstances. By going to a state that does not Deport them_ they are guaranteed the ability to stay someplace safe.,Internal-Ad-9390,Maleficent_Ad8881,22,3,2,3,1530

j0vu2cq,Most of the these you don’t need to test for unless you’re having active symptoms like a fever or sore throat. To be proactive_ you could ask to check on your vaccinations. Shots for flu_ hep_ Covid_ plus all the other usual ones (measles_ etc.) could protect you in the future and maybe help you feel less worried about catching anything.  If you’re older or have particular concerns though_ talk to your doctor about what they recommend. For people in their 40s or older_ chronic diseases (like heart health_ diabetes_ etc.) are more likely to be a concern vs. infectious disease. Checking your blood pressure_ doing a glucose challenge test_ a CBC (complete blood count)_ and a cholesterol test would all be normal things to ask about if you’re above around 40 or have other risk factors.  I’d recommend though_ talking to your doctor about your living situation and ask what they’d recommend for tests or other advice.  They probably know what’s potentially circulating in your local area. Hang in there!,OutOfTheArchives,Known-Ad2272,11,8,1,6,521

j0sjo7n,My life improved when I stopped going to therapy altogether. I was diagnosed PTSD and just about everything else. Therapy was always traumatizing to me. After my last bad experience I gave up altogether and started focusing on my self care. It seems I lose all my power and give it to the therapist. Therapy is too expensive and they don't guarantee anything. I would focus on building your coping skills. Therapists never taught me that.

Just remind yourself that you have a place now and it may take awhile but you can rebuild. As far as my past I've spent tons of time just thinking on everything.

So you can cut them into individual packets or leave them as a pack of two. They can be used in pockets & under blankets for 8 to 12 hours. They can also be wrapped in Saran wrap and they will reheat again a second time. Not as hard as the first time and not as long. But it does work a second time if you take out all the oxygen and let it sit for a few hours.

j0ryxt0,I was homeless for \~5 years_ might well be homeless again in the future_ and I definitely have mental health issues.  Complex PTSD_ ADHD_ a learning disability_ PMDD_ depression and anxiety.  Plus the total lack of supportive family/friends when shit got real.  I also think the experience of homeless itself_ whether it was the endless series of friends I had to sit through coming up with BS reasons to eject me from their lives_ needing to constantly be on guard to protect yourself_ how people treat you and think of you_ was traumatizing on its own.  I'm a different person after the experience_ and even less functional than I was before it happened.  America's homelessness crisis is as much about a system that deliberately crushes and punishes those who can't be hyper-productive capitalistic tools (i.e. those of us with mental and/or physical disabilities) as it is about soaring housing prices.,SesquipedalianPossum,Scary-Permission-293,18,8,1,3,1530

j0rkqzt,I'm diagnosed bipolar but I'm convinced I have BPD. Being homeless is incredibly difficult with mental health issues. I felt bullied in high-school and a bit after too. I think I'm an easy target for abusive people_ so I just attract that kind of attention. It's definitely hard for me to stay alive too. I think of suicide every day. My parents won't take me in and are emotionally abusive. I don't think they would care all that much or at all if I killed myself. They are narcissists and might pretend to care in order to get sympathy and to seem like decent people. I'm pretty sure it's all an act with them though. On top of having a difficult time being homeless with mental illness_ I'm pretty sure I have long covid and my physical and mental health are worse because of it. I actually feel like I have brain damage. I can't read as much as I used to be able to_ and I can't focus on what I'm reading for as long. It's also making it more difficult communicating with people when I need to buy food or talk to staff at a shelter. Life is hard. I don't see any way out of this for myself. I might eventually buy a tent when I just can't deal with people anymore. I don't think I could actually kill myself.,AdGold4022,Scary-Permission-293,18,5,1,3,1530

j0p9llv,It’s kinda up to you_ either way they will likely end up in the hands of people who need them. Some people might be looking to help a specific group_ such as mothers with children or veterans_ for example. In that case it makes sense to donate to an organization that serves that group. Some people like to pass out their donations personally and see exactly who is benefitting from their gift. Giving directly to individuals is often more rewarding but can also be time consuming.   Where I live I know of at least one organization that goes out and distributes donations to people on the street and in encampments and they allow donors to go out with them to hand out items. Something like that is kind of the best of both worlds. In the end_ there is no right or wrong here. There is plenty of need everywhere so your items will likely be put to good use.,MrsDirtbag,Subject-Release6722,7,2,1,3,1530
j0p2gky,Not seeing them is common_ I'm in a large city with a large homeless population but you'll rarely see them sleeping on sidewalks or under bridges unless you know where to look.  If you can get it directly to the people in need that's the best_ but not always possible.  I was never on the street_ I always found a place to go wether it was halfway house_ a long term shelter_ a rehab or at the end which was a year and a half ago until  3 weeks from yesterday_ transitional housing.  If you're going to donate to a place I'd avoid the larger institutions and give to the church based and smaller places as in my experience they are better at getting things to those that need them.  The transitional housing I'm in is run through the YMCA and they're assholes_ there are rooms filled with donations that they are hoarding rather than giving them to the people coming in that have nothing other than the clothes on their back. They stick you in a room that has a stove_ but you're lucky if there was a single pan left in the cupboard_ you get a blanket thats supposed to be decorative (the light weight type with all the holes woven into it people normally throw on the back of a chair) 1 plate_ 1 bowl a fork and a spoon and that's it.  I've been in a room that was full of like new pots and pans that were donated that they saving for god knows what_ the Y has money but this place is in the worst repair of any of the places I've stayed_ nothing works and no one cares...  Sorry about the rant_ just pointing out that you have to check out where you donate to.,vtssge1968,Subject-Release6722,7,2,1,3,1530
j0pxpwr,Rant yes_ but with helpful info for sure. Thanks!  Never heard this particular side of the Y before. I’ve volunteered before with events and such and there are a few in my area…surprisingly_ the one downtown is much nicer than I had ever expected.  During my volunteering time I had noticed some of what you’re describing…there was certainly a bit of stinginess here and there_ but nothing from my perspective (I was assigned to specific areas) so I didn’t see much.  I can say that facilities involving paid memberships were kept up nicely at this location.  It was the management that really creeped me out…they were just…cultish and a bit too judgmental at times.  Yes_ always check out where you donate too!  Thanks for sharing.,missfire23,Subject-Release6722,7,2,1,3,1530

j0pv3vc,Feeling pained as well_ but I’m echoing this suggestion of just supporting yourself and your sister.  It may not seem feasible now; however_ there’s just so much more that is likely available to you…being young helps in a lot of ways.  Now is the time to look into this if you want to get out of the cycle.  Please look further into it…take the Intel lesson as a guide.  Edit: Took me forever to find it_ but here’s essentially the specific Intel lesson I was referring to.  Direct quote from then CEO Andy Grove_ “People who have no emotional stake in a decision can see what needs to be done sooner.”  This is back when he was able_ with help_ to convince the executives at Intel that it was time to move on from memories and into microprocessing.  Quote from this online article_   https://fs.blog/andy-grove-value-facing-reality/   …”Grove mentions regarding Intel_ you must train yourself to see your situation from the perspective of an outsider.”  I know it’s business_ but feel it’s also helpful when confronting life’s problems.

Nobody visited me but the second I told my family I decided to live out of my car then all at once they cared about my safety. My rent went up $70 more per month. I was like why am I doing this? I was never hardly home anyway. I don't believe someone should stress over money. I'm not going to live and die that way. I thought too about not working a fixed schedule but for now I've worked the same place for over 5 years. It doesn't pay much but I do get about 4 weeks of vacation every year. During the holidays I travel because I don't like being forced to be around my family. It's not that I hate them but I'm a free spirit too and a deep thinker of life. My lifestyle works for me.

j0nwhk2,"I was homeless by choice for about half a year. I had become fed up of the pointless 9 to 5 grind and decided to throw it all away and hit the road. In a way it was the best and also worst decision of my life. I roamed around a few states and met a lot of interesting people_ but most of my time was spent just trying to find a place to eat_ sleep_ and sh*t. Being homeless is liberating in many ways_ but 4 walls of your own and a private bathroom really can't be beat in my opinion. Although I'm a man of relatively few needs_ I do prefer to have some small creature comforts.   I also didn't want to live a life in a way that exploited others_ aka working for corporations that exploit or the government_ I still don't. However_ as I was begging for a living or using public resources such as homeless shelters and food banks_ I felt that I was still exploiting the kindness of others_ and even worse I was potentially taking food and space from others who really needed it. I realized you gotta pick your battles in life and compromise on a lot_ but inherently you are only as happy in life with your situation as you wanna be.  In the end I decided to live in the middle path_ I will not pursue meaningless hollow wealth_ but I will live moderately comfortably by putting in the work at a modest job. I'm not happy about the fact that working for corporate interests inevitably harms others_ but I will try to offset that by helping those in need in my community in whatever small way I can. That is pretty much it. The only advice I can give anyone reading this is to stop chasing the unrealistic ideal and try to become content with what you have and what you can do_ even if it isn't what you think you want. Stop trying so hard to exist_ stop overthinking things_ let go and just let yourself be.   ""The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple.

j0okppt,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible because the full detailed version would end up being way too long.       Lost my job May of 2021 after working there for  nearly a decade_ Had recently moved back in with my mom who is disabled part of her disability being mental illness which was in decline. She's on SSDI and has a HCV/section 8. There's a discrepancy about a rental increase that Landlord requested starting June 1st. Which would increase the portion of rent that my mom was responsible for. This conflicts with  what my mom had previously been told by the housing authority. She attempts to confirm with her case worker at the housing authority and lets the landlord know that her **portion** of the rent would have to be confirmed before she could pay. The Landlord would and did receive the majority of the rent that was subsidized  on the 1st of every month.  My car gets repossessed in June_ but I do manage to get another job. It's for less money but works for me and is easy to get to by bus. We don't hear anything from the case worker until early July. The call does not go well. Case worker is reported. There's a whole back and forth with the case worker regarding paperwork etc... case worker gets everything she needs in order to calculate the corrected rent amount by the end of July.  In the meantime my mom has been keeping the Landlord updated. But with her behavior becoming more erratic the conversations done always go well and she ends up pissing them off.  I'm trying to take over things now.  August comes and the case worker still hasn't given us the amount.  I reach out to her. In the meantime we receive notice of eviction for non payment of rent. A court date is scheduled. BUT_ the federal eviction moratorium that was suppose to end on July 29th 2021 gets extended until October 3rd and prevents Landlords from evicting tenants for non payment of rent only.  So Landlord & Lawyer re file this time accusing my mom of ""extreme uncleanliness"" and being  a ""nuisance"" which is BS.  A new court date is set.  An eviction for someone on section 8 can automatically result in them losing their voucher_ their subsidy.  I start researching and contacting the housing authority etc.. in the midst of all of it and dealing with my mom who cant handle any of this. I get the dates of the hearing mixed up and end up missing it.  Which is an automatic win for the Landlord and we then receive a 10 day notice to vacate.  I reach out to a local legal aid non profit that provides legal services to the poor/low income for help.  I finally receive a response from the case worker who is aware of the eviction and is happy to tell me that eviction results in voucher loss oh and that she has that corrected rent amount for us finally.  I submit some reasonable accommodation requests to try and save my mom's voucher.  I let the case worker know  I contacted legal aid that's when she sends me the info for the emergency rental assistance program.  I get in touch with Legal Aid and she explains our options and works to push through our rental assistance application.  The offer to the Landlord is that if she drops the eviction that she will receive the total past due rent amount and the next three months rent in advance.  Landlord agrees but wants to add that we will agree to move by April 1st_ 2022 and also we have to personally pay the $500 legal fees.  We accept. She gets paid. Eviction gets dropped. Crises adverted...           We are paid up until January 1st 2022.  I start casually looking for apartments for rent in December. I reach out to the housing authority at the beginning of the year and ask if they offer any assistance for tenants searching for section 8 apartments. They send me a list that is  a half page long with listings from 2021 and 2020 that of course_ are no longer available.    The state of Pennsylvania where we live has no source of income law. Source of income laws prevent Landlords from denying rentals to people who are on section 8.  So with the exception of Philadelphia and I believe Pittsburgh who enacted their own source of income laws locally. The rest of the counties in the state have not. Which means refusing to rent to people on section 8_  is a perfectly legal form of discrimination and people are happy to do so.  I started documenting my rental search in February which I did daily. Everything was paid_ everyone was getting along so we ask the Landlord if she could  possibly reconsider the move  out date extending it.  She declined.  I reach out to the case worker ( New case worker) at the housing authority and submit  a reasonable accommodation request for an extended voucher extension.  You see when you have a housing voucher once you move out of a property you are given only a certain amount of time to find a new place to live. I think it's about 60 days normally_ if you can't find somewhere to live within that time frame you lose your voucher. But you can automatically get a month extension_ possible more if you're disabled though reasonable accommodation.  I also sent her a detailed email explaining the issues were having finding somewhere to live and pleading for help.  Only to get a one line response offering no help.  I was contacting rentals every day. I reached out to realtors who have worked with section 8 properties. Nothing.  April 1st comes and we don't know what to expect  we have no where to go.  We end up telling the Landlord and she agrees to another month.    But two weeks later we receive eviction notice_  My mom ends up falling and breaking bones having to go to the hospital. This happens of course the day we're suppose to be in court.  So we miss it_ she gets her judgement.  I email the lawyer from legal aid who helped us before asking her what to do. She tells me that I can file an appeal but that she technically can't help because our case had been closed out and we would have to re apply to open it again.  I didn't have time for that so with just a couple days before the Landlord can legally file the 10 day order to vacate. I have to get to the county court house and file an appeal. I manage to do it in time and get a hearing date for January 2023 and as long as I keep paying rent to the court we can stay in the apartment. So more time right....     No. So despite me making multiple trips to the court house throughout the month of May to make payments. The clerk that filed my paperwork did not explain something about certian sums of money having to be paid by specific dates correctly and me_ someone with no legal experience at all thinking I'm within the dates required to make payments I end up missing a deadline which left me open to the Landlord being able to file to vacate my supersedeas which is what was allowing us to remain on the property until the appeal date. I didn't realize it but the landlord's lawyer sure did and they went right in and filed to vacate it_ once it was we received a ten day order to vacate and on June 9th 2022. The police and landlord came to our apartment where my mother lived for 13 years and gave us 20 minutes to grab whatever we could carry and leave the premises. So me_ my mother who is completely out of her mind at this point and our 14 year old elderly Dog got evicted and were left sitting out front locked out  of our apartment.  As of that day we were homeless.   It continues to get worse and this lasted until October.  But this is already way too long so I'll end it here.",That_Girl_Cray,dadadies,37,2,1,3,1530

j0mu8ff,"For the first year I was here in my apt it was very hard to accept that it was going to be my permanent home. I was very anxious and even after a year I was convinced that unless things were PERFECT when they came to inspect the place that likely they would take it away from me and I would end up back in the shelter.   I never missed a rent payment. I was pretty much a model tenant but I was still worried I'd be rejected for another Affordable Housing voucher and a new lease. I scrubbed this place for DAYS before the inspection. Nobody does that here. The caseworkers were like ""Calm down. It will be fine!"" but that's how scared I was about renewal and keeping this place.   What you're feeling is natural under the circumstances. It's valid but you have to take a deep breath and risk it anyway. Being in a home again it will be worth all the anxiety_ I promise_ and when you can finally close the door and lock it and lay in your bed in your very own space again you will grin at your own fears.

j0me2zi,"Maybe.  Maybe you suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder_ and you get involuntarily depressed every winter_ and you subconsciously make mistakes and choices that put you on the streets.  Maybe you live in a city or town that sees seasonal employment_ and when the work closes up for the winter_ there's no money for housing.  Maybe [you are the grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper) who doesn't work hard to prepare for the winter.  It isn't the best of Aesop's fables... it isn't the best of any fables.  But there is truth in it.  It does indeed apply to some.  Ok.  You have family.  Could you communicate with them over a distance_ from a warmer climate_ for all the connection they appear to have to you at the moment?  You are going to be homeless in the snow.  For whatever it is worth_ this ""family"" doesn't seem all that close to you.  If it is mostly phone calls_ emails_ texts_ and DMs... you could do that from anywhere.  If you ABSOLUTELY have to be somewhere close by_ even if none of them will help you out... then you have to CHANGE something.  Maybe it is the work you do_ or the work you think you should do.  Maybe you have to give up something_ and bend to the rules that get you into a shelter and transitional housing.  Maybe you have to tell a family member you are sorry_ and make amends.  Maybe you have to agree to rehab.  Maybe you have to compromise and use the shelter system in a town or city nearby.  Maybe you have to learn about better winter gear_ and prepare for this possibility if it happens with frequency.  Is there a Salvation Army Thrift store near you?  Go to the nearest one.  Ask them where their Administrative office is_ and tell them you want to know because you are homeless and you want to sign up for assistance.  They will either direct you to the location of the admin office_ or they will assist you.  This involves letting them ask you questions so they can create a profile in their database... just like getting assistance from any other organization.  Then_ they will load you up with clothing_ a coat_ and whatever gear they have available_ or vouchers so you can GET that stuff at their thrift stores.  This means sleeping bags_ possibly a tent_ maybe even a Coleman stove.... boots_ socks_ etc.  I_ and everyone else out here_ have no idea why you are always homeless in the winter.  **Only you** have the information that leads to knowing what has to change.

j0lvql6,I am going to say this_ given I have worked in customer service (not a call center) and I have a quite a bit of factory work experience.   Through the many factories I have worked at_ very rarely did I find one that was a light factory_ with very little movement and put some type of strain on my body. The only type of factories that I did work at that was light in movement was when I worked at a (placebo) iron making company_ where we just put the iron in a machine and the machine did everything from up_ and we pull the iron from the crane_ band wrap the machine_ and just do a lot of paperwork. Or when I worked at factories where all I did was pick and pack orders and practically just drive a forklift all day.    There have been factory jobs where I have made so much money weekly but had to work 10 hour shifts_ six days a week with double time_ and 1.5 in a half. The money was great and all_ but I had little room to enjoy life. The perks of working in factories is that you could easily make a lot of money_ however do not put all of your bags in one egg. Factory work even if it is easier work can put a strain on your body.   Whenever I worked customer service_ I had more room for work_ but I suffered the most not from customers (for the most part) but from management and they were worse than most management than I experience in the workplace.      Since you do have a physical condition_ I would be cautious of factories to work in.    I would also see if there would be ways to expand any skills you may have or be interested in_ and gain certificates or anything that would generate you more income than entry level positions. Inflation is going up the roof over the past few years_ and many jobs do not cover the expenses of rent let alone_ the rest of the annoying bills we have to pay.   There are going to be narcissist and all types of people who are dysfunctional and try to pull power trips on people_ even if you have worked for the company for a lot of years. No matter what jobs you work at_ they are going to be there. I have NOT YET_ had a job without someone who is just wicked_ vile_ and get their self-worth in how they put others down_ or trying to get brownie points on becoming manager_ when the position is not even open_ or they are underqualified for.   I'm going to just say this and it took me years to understand this. Since these types of people exist and will love abusing others_ and are just straight up bullies. How you react to these individuals in these situations will make a world of a difference to your experience. Remember_ you are there to collect your check_ and do you thing_ and take care of responsibilities. These narcissists and everything else that work at these factories or places are too. How you react to these individuals_ will determine if you find stability in the future or not. Remember_ they will always be around to make our lives miserable.   The path you should choose is not if the job is able to pay your bills alone which is the main reason we work. But to see what you can gain out of the current job you have_ and build on top of that. Doing this will open more doors for you to gain more money later on in life as you continue to gain experience in whatever job you work at.   For example_ let's say I worked at a grocery store and I started from the very bottom. Let's say at this grocery store there are opportunities for me to learn how to drive a forklift_ but I do not have forklift experience. My objective working at this retail store_ is to drive the forklift and become experienced with it_ so I can take my forklift driving skills from a grocery/retail store_ and be able to easily obtain jobs that pays more driving a forklift.,Markie199711,Savonarola1452,11,1,1,3,1530

Some ~~homeless~~ people (we don't know if they were homeless) broke in_ trashed a few rooms_ and took the front door off the stove.  I was homeless in Olympia at the time.  He called me_ and asked me to come be homeless at his house_ to watch over it until it sold.  I had use of the garage as a ""room""_ use of the bathroom... I cleaned and filled a couple of trailers full of stuff for the dump_ parked in the back yard... sometimes slept in the house_ sometimes slept in the truck.  And_ he paid me $400 when I was done.  Hiring homeless_ to protect empty property from vandals/thieves.  I still wish I could have turned that into something.  I know it would depend on getting realtors onboard.

j0k9l0b,I live in the west coast_ I think Santa Barbara has it better than San Diego. Basically California residents get easy access to food stamps_ just need an ID and proof of income or you tell your case worker you’re unemployed and California will give it to you. When I leaves in Texas_ they were not so kind about giving a “handout” and made me jump through way more hoops to get snap food stamps. cali also offers the best medical care for the poor (in the USA)… but the downside is housing is super expensive here so getting out of homelessness is a struggle. Climate is decent here though_ not too hot and not too cold_ can easily sleep on the beach and have a nice view. Personally I stay out of Los Angeles… i don’t understand why some homeless people go to skid row when Orange County and Santa Barbara are safer_ other then I guess because there are outreaches that go to to skid row each day and kind of offer to help whereas if you’re in OC_ you have to go seek the help yourself. As someone who has experienced homelessness on and off in California because of how expensive housing is and inflation is crazy here_ I am curious 👀 to if the grass is greener on the other side like maybe Oregon_ Washington…. I bet there’s tons of cities that are so small but have a better sense of community and help people who are in need.,bat2ghost,veryberryblue,4,1,5,3,1530
j0l7lbr,"A lot of long-term homeless in WA & OR and I'm told we have phenomenal programs to assist the homeless. The states do require a TON of hoops to jump through and a lot of the housing up here isn't affordable because longtime Californian's sell their homes for cash and pay for real estate in WA & OR in full with the proceeds of selling in California.   The weather also sucks up here to be homeless depending on where you end up. The average rainfall is roughly nine months in the greater Portland Metro and SW Washington areas. A quick Google search nets Seattle receiving around eight months of rain and Seattle's cost of living is probably one of the highest in the nation_ but_ they DO have good programs for the homeless so it's a tradeoff. Portland also has good programs but again_ cost of living and the challenges to get out of being homeless.  I've met folks who have been addicts and homeless here in SW Washington who have gone from sleeping on the streets_ into a shelter_ gotten into recovery_ and now work for a state sub-contractor with their own place to call home. It can be done up here but there's a whole lot of hoops to jump through_ doors to open and walk through_ a lot of patience you need to have_ and it has to be worked for.   Also_ remember that the main metro areas like Portland and Seattle have great programs but outlying cities don't take kindly to giving people what they perceive as ""handouts"". So_ if you do end up here_ stick to the larger populated cities.",FreeLoadNWhiteGuy,veryberryblue,4,1,1,8,1024
j0k1dqy,"90% of the ""residential"" area is governed by an HOA. By ""residential"" i mean any land under contract_ whether developed or not. It's the cheapest way for the local and state govt to maintain the land. It also means there's lots of restrictive laws_ and despite the homeless population there_ it's virtually illegal to be so. If you have a job and you're homeless and you piss off a coworker_ they can report you for vagrancy where they know you sleep_ which will get you 24hrs in custody. That's a no-call/no-show_ because you're one call can only be to your lawyer_ or a family member. Not your employer.  Most employers are sympathetic_ but keep missing one day a week because you're getting picked up every Monday or Tuesday_ or worse_ the night before your busy day_ and they'll be forced to fire you.

j2ymyie,The answers about “best” being subjective are so dumb. Obviously the best place to be homeless is going to be the best place to get out of homelessness. Why would anyone even ask on the internet about the best place to stay homeless_ as if it’s a life style. The only reason to ask people online is that you want to survive.  I’m also looking for the best place to be homeless. I live with my mom in my car that doesn’t stay warm enough to live in the Midwest. I need to find somewhere I can survive and build my life up as fast as possible. Work camps/housing included jobs are not going to work unless both me and my mom can get in at the same time. Any suggestions?,Dkui2200,veryberryblue,4,1,1,3,1530
j0j7dh1,I have survived up to negative 10° below zero in my van. Basically I had a sleeping bag with two fleece blankets and a large heavy duty comforter. I also found a California king size comforter that I stretched around the van like a tent and I started my van every 4 to 5 hours to keep warm but for the most part even when I fell into a deep sleep I was okay. The key is to maintain your warmth.   For those of us that don't have vehicles I've seen people successfully use water resistant sleeping bags and put the comforter inside with them it looks puffy and uncomfortable but it does the job. Mind you you have to wear some clothing as well I had a hoodie cotton pants and socks as long as with the beanie.

j0kb49u,While it can't be promised_ chances are these are empty threats. It sounds like someone stupid got fucked over and now you're being threatened because you appear to be an easy target (could be just because you're a woman by yourself - i think - while dude missing money is a man).   Usually when people are serious about messing you up over money_ it's not going to be this small of an amount_ it's not going to be food stamps_ and you aren't going to get this many threats. Generally people who are serious will maybe tell you once or twice if they think you'll cough up money_ but after that_ you're getting got. It seems like they know you don't have the money in cash_ so they just want the food stamps. Very few people are going to be willing to commit the crime of severely injuring you over some food stamps. Nobody wants to go to prison for that.   I could be reading the situation completely wrong_ but I don't think you need to be TOO worried about these people. Take precautions_ you know_ don't let them catch you alone and corner you_ maybe some pepper spray is a good idea.  I can't make promises_ like I said_ but I think this is going to amount to a lesson learned about trusting new sketchy strangers for you and not much more.,Suckmyflats,TaintTouchin,65,3,1,8,1024

j0kgxml,You look like a mark. You are on the streets_ this aint a game. Dude did not take off_ he is still around. You are still around_ people are lying. If they murder you over food_ they were gonna murder you anyhow. If they did not hand the money to you_ they know it's not your fault. I doubt they even handed him any money. Stop being weak. Tell them to fuck themselves. If they were serious_ they would have already fucked you up. They are just vultures looking for scraps. You are living the fucking life_ there is no way out. You must rise up and defeat all of your fears of you ever want to stop being homeless. They are bullying you_ and paying them or giving them your food sure as hell is not going to make it go away_ in fact_ if you don't hold your ground_ they will do this for a longer period of time. Once they see you as a food or money source_ they will keep coming back. It is far_ far more dangerous to give them anything_ than to be hard now. Time to realize life ain't a game. Man the fuck up_ and do your best. But Do Not under any circumstances give them anything easily just because you think it's easier or safer. I personally like to remind people in your position_ that no matter how tough someone is_ their neck is still soft_ and if attacked_ it will be self defense.

j0fdll7,That’s a thoughtful gift for them. I think many would take that gift in a heartbeat.,Ilikesilverandspam,Sirensong_6842,4,2,1,8,1024
j0lp5na,People would love it.  It just wouldn't do the job everyone thinks.  There is a fundamental difference many people can't see.  Homed individuals go out into the cold where a hand warmer would be useful... and then go back inside to actually get warm when their time outside is finished.  That is the target customer base for an item like that.  A similar item would be the heated cushions you can bring to sporting events.  A portable_ heated pad like that sounds like it would be a great idea for someone who spends a lot of time in the cold.  That fundamental difference is... spending a lot of time in the cold_ versus spending virtually ALL of one's time in the cold.  If one's default location is a cold one_ where there is no finding of a warm place to spend hours... the problem becomes one of heating the chest_ not the hands.  Warm hands feels nice... sure.  Feet need warmth too.  And noses_ and ears_ etc.  A box of disposable one-time use handwarmers are better for THIS kind of situation_ only because you can use multiple packs at a time_ in different locations simultaneously.. one in each shoe_ one for each hand_ maybe a couple in some shirt pockets... maybe a pair at your lower back if you are sitting or laying down.  Then_ you've got heat at those extremities and body points for 6-10 hours at a time.  The down side_ is how many of those packs you go through at one time.  Someone relatively recently posted about a heated vest that they saw on sale_ from a company that makes expensive heated clothing.  The placement of the heating elements in the pants and jackets were great... the expected battery life was obviously only meant for recreational use of a couple of hours at a time before needing to be recharged.  Like.. Ski Clothing_ version 2.0.  Same kind of stuff would be great for the homeless in the cold_ if the battery life lasted 4 to 6 times longer.  And if the gear used replaceable batteries.  Using custom soft Li-On packs means when they no longer hold a charge_ you throw the clothes away.  Sure_ soft Li-On packs can be any shape the manufacturer needs_ while staying slim.. think the batteries in phones and tablets.  It just doesn't do a homeless person any good when the $300-$600 electric outfit they wear for the winter_ only lasts for that one winter at most.  Again.  People will love getting them.  They will be grateful.  Just remember.... when you've been cold for 14-18 hours_ and you are trying to sleep for the night to make it to the morning where you can get warm for a while_ only having that one rectangle of heat might end up being more frustrating than comforting.  When it has been a while_ and there's still more cold ahead_ you can't seem to find the right place to put the handwarmer and you spend more time awake moving it around than you do sleeping with it in the right spot... because there isn't one right spot.  If they aren't too expensive... maybe give them out in pairs (one for each armpit_ or one for the chest and one between the thighs)?  Maybe include a few $3 Emergency Thermal Blankets (from the camping section in Walmart) as well?,bongart,Sirensong_6842,4,2,1,8,1024

j0axfwv,You aren't going to die unless you give up. Millions of homeless people are alive and well right now to one degree or another.  What do you do? Prioritize staying alive. I assume here that you have no dollars to your name...  #### WATER:  Get water. Even if you gotta stick your face in the bathroom sink and drink. Drink till you're full-- and find a container to fill. Check all the trash cans for empty bottles with screw-on tops. Trashy and dirty_ yes. But you need to be able to carry water somehow to avoid future dehydration.  #### SLEEP.  2.1. Is it above freezing outside??? If so...  You need to crash for a few hours. Don't go to a bus stop or anywhere where people would regularly walk by at night. Find a dark corner somewhere. Under a tree_ or in some bushes_ or with your back to a chain-link fence. If you can scrounge up some cardboard and/or a blanket_ that'll make things way more comfortable. Cover yourself with what you've got_ and get something under you too for insulation. Cardboard sheets are magic.  2.2 Is it freezing temps outside?  Stay inside. If this wallmart has a subway/starbucks or whatever attached_ sit around there until day time. If there isn't anything like that_ you could probably lay out in a bathroom stall... either of these options are likely to lead to an encounter with employees_ possibly followed by an encounter with a cop. Be polite_ be honest-- explain your situation and ask those employees and/or the Officer for help.  #### Your near future...  Keep calling those shelters. Carry water. Keep your device charged. Figure out what you need to sleep comfortably: tent? Blankets? Giant puffy coat? Do you prefer darkness and bushes? Maybe a well-lit doorway with a camera? Sometimes people are less likely to start shit if you point out that they're being filmed. Figure out how to get food_ one way or another.

I've been where you are and it took me half a decade to get out but it is possible.   Nothing worked for me till I got into the system and started working it from within. As horrible as shelters are they're the first stepping stone for a lot of homeless people towards a better life.   It is brutally hard the life you are living now but if you can't find help where you are then the best thing you can do is get yourself to someplace better to work from. You CAN survive this but you have to learn to think outside the box and to be your own best advocate.   Coming back to NYC probably saved my life. If I had become homeless where I used to live I'd have been in pretty much the same situation. No real resources and a horrible climate most of the year besides that probably would have literally killed me given my health issues.   NYC has a pretty horrible shelter system and the social workers and that they are slow to provide real help. It was supremely discouraging and frustrating at times. But it got me healthcare. The system supported me till I got disability and it got me housed again.   For that I am truly grateful and you will never hear me dissing NYC because of that. I am literally alive today because NYC had the resources available for me to get help and get out. None of it would ever have happened where I used to live. I'd have likely died of neglect_ depression_ and chronic illness long before now.   Instead I'm living in a tiny studio in Manhattan and doing mostly okay and counting my blessings not my hardships.   You have to get to someplace where you can get real help. That's the first big step for you towards getting out. You can do it.  This is but a season in your life and it's a bad one but eventually it will pass. It doesn't have to be the end unless you let it be.   Been there_ done that_ and believe me I know. There were lots of days where I thought I couldn't endure one more minute of the constant indignities and the fight for survival. I just wanted to lay down my head and die_ but then I almost did and it led me into the system and that ironically saved my life and led to a better one.   There are other places where you might do better. Find one and get there. Go into the system_ work it and get out. It won't be easy but you can do it.   🤗🤗🤗,mtempissmith,needtheword,67,12,1,9,1231
j0asy7q,Is there a Traveller’s Aid Society office in your city?  What they have done in the past_ of course with information that you provide them_ is contact a “family” member in a different city and they will purchase or offer a discounted bus (Greyhound) ticket to travel to a different city_ so you can “reunite” with your family.  They will verify your “relative”. and how you are “related” to them and how your “relative” will “support” you in a a different community.  I only suggest a change of location because maybe there will be more possible opportunities and a better environment for you to succeed/survive compared to the community you currently are living in.  Stay safe and watch your back_ especially when resting/sleeping.  You may want to scout out a more remote/isolated place before you try to rest/sleep.

j0ccsr8,">Anyone ever been to this point _ what do I do?  You are in a sub populated with people who have also hit their own respective rock bottoms.  Some_ more than once.  Imagine if you hit rock bottom.... and climb back up only to later_ find you can hit it again at different depths.  What do you do?  There is a ton of great advice out there_ and you've already gotten some of it.  All the advice you are going to get_ however... the advice that is useful... is all going to be local to \*YOU\*.  People can suggest sleeping behind dumpsters_ or in bushes_or under a bridge.... but none of that matters if you can't find any dumpsters_ there are no bushes or hedges that you know of_ and your area has no bridges you can remember.  You are the one who now has to become really familiar with the area you are homeless in.  That means exploration.  That means reconnaissance.  It means getting off the sidewalk and behind buildings_ or in the tall grass_ or in a copse of wood.    It means looking at Google maps.  Where trains and roads meet_ sometimes there is a bridge.  Highways have overpasses and elevated on/off ramps.  You can even use Google to let you virtually walk down streets and roads_ to get an idea of where buildings with cover \*might\* be.... before you actually walk down those streets.  It is \*ALMOST\* like using Google as your own personal drone_ to do most of your scouting for you.  You can use that view to find sections of forest that look dense and are not close to businesses and residences.  >I have called every shelter there is... Nothing is available right now.  You mean... you've called every shelter there is_ ***and you've put yourself on their waiting lists***_ but none have any space at the moment... right?  You \*DID\* put yourself on their waiting lists?  Why is that important?  Well... first_ if_ say_ there are three shelters in the area_ and they all have waiting lists_ it is extraordinarily likely that the names on **each** list will almost be the same for **all** three lists.  People who sign up_ will sign up with all of them_ so they can get into the first one out of all of them_ that has the space.  Second... people won't always respond when it is their turn_ especially if the list is long and they already found their own solution while they waited.  So getting on a long list doesn't necessarily always mean a long wait.  When a bed opens up_ they can cut through half a dozen names on their list looking for the next person who wants it.  You have fallen off a cliff.  Up there_ was stability.  Up there_ was the life track everyone else seems to be on.  Tunnel vision in your desire and want to get BACK to what you had_ makes you think you are in a hole.  But you aren't.  You didn't fall into a hole.  You fell off a cliff.  That means you can stop looking up asking ""How do I climb back up this impossible wall?""... and you can look to your left_ your right_ and behind you instead.  And in this case_ I'm not just speaking metaphorically.  You really have to start walking around_ looking into places you've never really looked before.  You have to take stock of your surroundings.  Are you in the USA?  Are you aware of what SNAP food stamp benefits are?  Do you know that you can likely sign up for them_ online?  If you wonder about things like... how you have no address... you can use things like General Delivery to your closest post office and be honest that you HAVE no street address.  Some online portals actually take the homeless into account_ and will accept the nearest intersection as a street address.  But... that is a specific things to look into_ it is well detailed in many posted locations on being something you need to do_ and it will take time to get them.  What do you do for food now?  There are soup kitchens_ food banks_ churches to hit up_ dumpsters to dive_ fast food Chicken places to hit up right after closing (they make food they have to toss at the end of the night more than other fast food places).  Finding these places is going to burn shoe leather_ and require exploration.  >Is death the only other option?  Obviously not_ since **Exploration of your area is an option**_ as I just detailed.  Another option is to LEAVE your area for one with better/more resources.  You have two feet... and if you can't sleep_ you can trudge.  Where do you go?  When you search Google for local homeless shelters_ what happens when you expand the map to include other towns?  What happens when you search specifically for homeless shelters in those towns?    Sometimes_ you might even find luck in smaller towns with only one or two shelters.  I know I did with Jacksonville NC for a while_ once upon a time.... small town_ one shelter_ half-full.  And that doesn't mean trudging to a new town and THEN seeing what is there... it means online searches_ phone calls_ and THEN trudging to a new place with more and/or better opportunities.  >I was forced to sleep at the bus stop again  Who forced you to sleep there?  Did they use a weapon when they threatened you?  If you want to say that circumstance forced you to sleep there... then you aren't taking responsibility for your CHOICE to sleep there.  You could have chosen to look around for a more secluded place to sleep_ but you didn't.  That is not circumstance forcing you to sleep in that spot... it was a choice you justified before you closed your eyes.  You slept at a bus stop before_ so you must have some sense from your experience_ that this is a safe place to sleep.  That is a MISTAKE to assume_ and you have now been reminded of that fact.  You are not going to get ANYWHERE_ if you don't learn from your mistakes.  You are not going to LEARN from your mistakes_ if you don't acknowledge making them.  You chose to sleep on that bench.  Own that.  If you want to walk into a wooded area_ bend a bunch of saplings together_ and tie it into a bunch... while they are still in the ground... and then cover the outside with underbrush... you can make yourself a hut.  Not a great one... but that's from the crap on the ground around you in the woods.  You can make a lean-to out of that stuff on the ground.  If you explore_ you might find sections of tarp_ pieces of linoleum countertop that peeled away from what it was attached to_ plywood... all kinds of things that you could use to build that shelter.  But even if you didn't explore and find that stuff_ if the forest is big enough_ everything will already be there to be able to construct some kind of shelter from the elements.  It isn't rocket science.  Our ancestors did this for eons... tens_ if not hundreds_ of thousands of years.  If you are on the list for shelter space_ you are only killing time until you get in.  What do you do?  You take it one day at a time.  You deal with today.  Need a goal?  Find a Salvation Army Administrative office.  They will load you up with supplies/clothes/gear.  Might even have a shelter they can ***transport*** you to.... possibly even local cash assistance.  If it is a long walk to get to it.... well_ that's the work you do in exchange for the help you get out of it.",bongart,needtheword,67,7,1,8,1024

j0eze2o,I just wanted to piggyback on this reply to agree with keeping to yourself. You need all your energy to concentrate on getting yourself through this and while throwing in with a bunch of other homeless people seems like a logical step_ it rarely works out. There is too much drama and theft and backstabbing. In my opinion it's much better to be alone and just always quietly aware of your surroundings.   Also_ always be looking for a better spot.

j0crx41,I live in San Jose_ CA and we’re somewhat unique compared to other large cities in that our airport is basically adjacent to our downtown. When I was homeless I would go there to charge sometimes. The easily accessible public restrooms are nice too_ plus you can return luggage carts for quarters_ although the cart jockeys will try to get to them first. The great thing about hanging out at the airport is that someone who looks a little tired_ a little disheveled_ with a bunch of stuff plugged in doesn’t look out of place. Even though you can’t go through security without a boarding pass a lot of people who arrive very early for a flight (or if there is a long delay) don’t pass through security until closer to their departure time_ so it’s not strange to be there.   For best results you shouldn’t stay in the same location for more than an hour or two. I wouldn’t want to *sleep* there personally_ but that’s just me.,MrsDirtbag,Balls2374,34,5,1,3,1530

j0dci3n,It's kind of hard to stay at airports for long periods of time. When I was the sheriff's deputy back in the day we would notice people who were lurking too long. There's also a certain security features at airports where at the same person keeps popping up you're going to be questioned it's also public info that the majority of airports have facial recognition cameras.  Both plain clothes and regular security. that's not to mention that depending on the lay out of the airport it might not be any place for you to stay since you'll have to go past security.    However_ that's not to say when I was homeless and I stayed in the airport most of the security folks after they got to know me left me alone as long as I stayed out the way and kept myself reasonably clean. Now from the time I was a sheriff deputy usually after a while we ignore the homeless folks that we know and identified. We usually give them hints when it's time to move along.,johnfro5829,Balls2374,34,4,1,3,1530
j0e24e3,"Not really_ There's no point playing hide and seek in a modern airport with hundreds of cameras and staff. From my own experience as a traveller and occasional ""resident"" I'd say there's hardly any legal basis in most parts of the world to remove you from the open parts of an airport. Bona fide travellers may stay in airports two or three days anyway because of flight cancellations and such_ and I don't think anyone's counting_ though it will become obvious to some staff you're becoming a resident. They'll typically question you_ both as a formality and out of boredom. But they won't be able to kick you out on some pretext like bad hygiene without risking having to prove later on that they applied the same standards to other passengers.  So_ just to be clear_ you can stay at airports for a VERY long time.

j09s5xn,Also homeless in Colorado here. It can get really nasty out there on cold nights. And the weather is going to be pretty damn cold for a while. So if you can gear up_ now it's the time.  I have had good luck keeping warm with the following items:  • A sleeping pad to cover the ground. This is essential_ as if you lay directly on the ground without inadequate layer to protect you_ all your heat will drain away through the ground. Incidentally_ if you're anywhere near Glendale_ I have a spare sleeping pad and a half that need a good home_ as I just upgraded mine. In the past_ I have gotten away with it simply using layers of cardboard.  • A good sleeping bag. Something rated below 32°F/0°C.  • A good thick blanket to go over the sleeping bag. A local activist gave me a heavy comforter — but any kind of thick or insulated blanket will do.  • A tent_ tarp_ or other windbreak that's also resistant to rain and moisture.  The problem with all of this right now_ however_ are the sweeps that they've ramped up. This makes it virtually impossible to set up any kind of structure to shelter under_ except in some of the larger camps downtown_ which are supposed to have a week's notice before a sweep.  Finding a sheltered area_ such as under a bridge_ is advised_ except it's also an obvious place where they are likely to check. There are some bridges that are more secluded_ where you could hide up in underneath and not be obvious. Might not even need a tent under there.,thelink225,Both-Intern4835,13,7,1,3,1530

I don’t want to alarm you_ but depending on where you are in Colorado and how cold it becomes outside_ you or anyone else that is outside has a larger risk of dying due to hypothermia and/or cold exposure.  With that said_ I actually spoke to a man the morning after he slept outside in 18 degree F (probably lower with the wind chill) in Colorado.  The man told me he slept in an alley with at-least five or six blankets on top of and around him.  I don’t know how many more nights he survived outside_ but I wouldn’t do it.  I remember one year reading in news from the large cities in Colorado that almost sixty people without homes died throughout one twelve month period in just one of the large Colorado cities.,Fair-Background-8680,Both-Intern4835,13,2,1,3,1530

This late into winter you would at least need a tent_ 0 degree bag_ sleeping pad_ thermals_ boots_ etc just to not freeze to death.  And you're still gonna be cold.  Pro tip:  Go down to the sandwich line at Auraria Campus at 11am.  After they finish feeding_ they open up their clothing room.  They have the best clothing room in the city.  And for some weird reason they have a lot of sleeping pads.  I don't think homeless people know what they are because no one ever takes them.

Do you have a job_ any cash_ and where are you located roughly? Do you have anywhere in Denver metro where you feel safe to tent?  If you can get a small tent_ a tarp to cover it_ and good clothing you can make it through most of the cold nights_ and you know how it normally only lasts for a few days. I'd recommend looking into the emergency weather shelters for extra cold nights as well,masterchris,Both-Intern4835,13,2,1,3,1530

Section 8 waitlist is 10 years long [I was fast tracked and got it faster but still took me two years and even with Section 8 I couldn't get an apartment]. Affordable housing has long wait lists_ 3+ years. Transitional housing/emergency shelters have long wait lists_ multiple weeks or months. There are some shelters with no waitlists_ but they require you start lining up at 3pm to get in. They're first come first serve_ so if you don't get in you're out of luck. You have to line up literally everyday at 3pm_ stand in a line for hours with a bunch of other homeless people. Expect to sleep outside most nights_ that's what I had to do.    All of this is for a major city_ not sure how small towns are. I expect it to be harder because there's less resources    Edit: oh yeah I forgot_ don't take anything valuable to the shelter.

j01aqw2,There were a lot of people who treated me like crap when I was homeless but there were also a few people I considered  everyday angels. You have to focus on the good people_ not the bad. It's a hard mindset to leave behind_ feeling like human trash. Even when you stop being homeless it stays with you for a long while.   I don't think I will ever leave being homeless behind. It caused some fundamental changes in my character_ some good_ some bad. I don't trust people like I used to and I'm not nearly as kind. I'm far more cynical when it comes to people and their motives that's for sure but I do make an effort not to be too suspicious or nasty and I try not to just assume the worst of people.   I think for me it was a bit different than for some other people. In my life I've always had to deal with people trying to bully me_ trying to make me feel bad about myself. Being homeless multiplied that by 100x but since I'd previously experienced it I was able to seperate that bullying from my sense of self.   Being able to do that probably helped me a lot in terms of being able to be stable mentally. I'm not a docile person. I don't sit there and take it when people abuse me. I can't so needless to say that made me very unpopular at times in the shelters where staff and residents both like to do just that.   Being homeless could have turned me into a very angry_ horrible person but I simply refused to let that happen. It's a choice. You can either let being homeless beat you up emotionally and define you or you can choose to defy it_ get busy_ and get yourself out.   Someone I met early in the experience told me that being homeless was a seaon in my life. That it might seem hopeless but that eventually it would be over and real life would begin anew. It was the longest season of my life but in the end I did pass through it and I made it out to a real home and a better life.   You can too but in order to do it you have to own your own life and control how you respond to the abuse. Let the negativity  eat you up emotionally you won't make it out. Defy it and you will.   Never mind what negative people think.   You do for you and you believe in yourself and you'll be far more likely to make it.,mtempissmith,RomeosBlueStar,105,61,1,9,1231

I learned to give people leeway before they earn trust.... play out the rope a bit more before I commit to anything.  I learned to ask questions_ to determine if kindness is genuine_ or hides ulterior motives... basically I learned to insert a buffer of time between me and anything that requires trust_ to give me the time to determine if trust is warranted.  I had to learn that... I'm still learning that.  I've learned that whether or not I want to trust_ has nothing to do with it_ and can actually only cause problems.  I dunno.  Maybe the new caution is a good thing... keep you off the path of homelessness.  Maybe you find a way to help some of the others still on the streets.

To not feel kindness and love towards a fellow human especially one at such a disadvantage in their life must be awful. I try not to take it personally either. It's not me personally they are disgusted with its the situation. It could have been any homeless person sitting there and they would have gotten it just the same. Thats how I choose to look at it.   While stripping in my 20s I acquired thick armour. I got used to shitty comments without damaging my self esteem.   People who treat you badly just simply aren't worth giving your time to.

j007cun,Hi_ I work at a homeless shelter so I can maybe help a bit. First of all_ thank you for offering to help your friend ❤ Some of the items you've mentioned probably wouldn't be allowed to be brought into a shelter - outside pillows and blankets are a bedbug risk_ a space heater could be a potential fire hazard_ cleaning supplies are provided at the shelter. Some shelters also limit or entirely ban outside food_ drink_ or toiletries because guests can use them to sneak in drugs or alcohol - it sucks but it is what it is.   Some material things that our guests really appreciate are good quality_ sturdy backpacks and shoes_ comfortable pajamas_ slide on slippers/shower shoes_ and always nice hoodies - I swear I get hit up for hoodies at least 5 times a day. Ear buds to block out the noise from others are also super popular.   For her kiddo_ how old is he? Look at maybe gifting experiences for her to do with her son that she otherwise might not be able to afford - family shelters usually have tons of toys available. Is there a local trampoline park in her area that they could go to on a rainy day? Indoor pool_ Chuck e Cheese_ Dave and Busters_ a local zoo or amusement park? Something like that would make an amazing gift and wonderful memory for both of them!  Again thank you for supporting your friend - I'm sure just knowing that she has you is a gift in and of itself ❤,wifeatron3000,sillychickengirl,41,46,1,8,1024

j03baqz,Piggy backing on this as a shelter associate as well_ this is the best and most comprehensive answer. There are so many things that are not allowed to be brought in. (Pepper spray being one of them) She may find that she needs things as they come up but the less she has in a shelter_ the better. Theft is rampant and the shelter is not liable.   Outlets are limited and mostly reserved for those who require oxygen or use scooter chairs. Think_ a weighted blanket as opposed to a heated blanket.   Things I'm asked for the most: shower shoes_ ear plugs_ hand warmers_ socks_ razors_ bus passes.   Things I see people need the most: headphones_ slippers_ portable chargers_ a bag or suitcase that locks.   I am a huge advocate of gifting experiences and can't recommend it enough. Being in a shelter is mentally exhausting for both residents and staff alike so anything that gets them out of the shelter will help.,Cool_Jackfruit_4466,sillychickengirl,41,3,1,3,1530

j00ngcj,Outside of everything already said I think items that make us feel a little more humanized often get left out but can have a big impact. As someone mentioned less is often better_ which means women give up a lot of material items such as makeup_ jewelry_ nicer lotions and perfumes.

And to the very good suggestion of experiences_ if there are kids museums or other things in her area_ especially if there's something she can enjoy as well_ a membership.

izy4d3z,Six days ago a user on this sub posted a question asking information about being homeless_ and pregnant. There was a user in that thread that stated she gone through the experience of being homeless_ and pregnant recently_ and is now working at a homeless shelter. You may want to ask that user for advice.   Besides living in Florida… Your friend might be experiencing difficulties finding resources based on the lactation she’s in. Hurricane Ian was a doozy_ and was immediately followed by hurricane Nicole. The areas “ in or around the Villages” is most likely overwhelmed with people who have home damage_ or lost their homes completely.   Selling her car is a massive risk. If she plans on using the proceeds for housing the money will run out quick_ and may make it difficult to get to work depending on her location. This is obvious_ but I needed to mention it.     If she_ and the other homeless mother can “commit” to working together it could be a working solution. Providing child care for one another_ working opposite shifts… but again I would warn your friend against using the capital from the sale of her car to fund this idea.   Sometimes religious organizations can be helpful_ she could call churches in her surrounding area_ and ask for help. When she speaks to them I would limit the details given to them. With two little ones she’s in a precarious situation. She could also call Goodwill_ and the Salvation Army.

They have a database on their website if you put in a city or zipcode it will tell you where to get free pet food. They also have free vet care and helped pay for my feral to get an operation. They paid half and friends on twitter paid the other half. They pay all of it I just didnt want all their money spent on us. For vet care you have to call them. They also have free crates. Dont know how you get them but again you have to call. They have resources on their website and also if you call them as all they deal with is homeless people and animals and probably vets to help people. They paid over the phone with a credit card so you just need a vet who will take it near you_ but always call first. They are open M-F 9-3pm and remember are in Nevada.

izuxuai,Dropping off in front of a tent is probably not the best idea because you can't guarantee the person in the tent will be able to use what you're passing on. Alternatively_ you can initiate conversation with folks and ask if they could benefit from what you have to offer.  You can try a shelter local to you_ but please be aware they may not be able to accept your donation either.   The facility I work for is small and only 5% of the people receiving our services opt to utilize our clothing closet. There's a much larger facility local to us_ but they don't accept used clothing_ only new items. Be prepared and know YMMV.,Hot_Computer8067,FrugalLuxuryKitten,23,11,1,8,1024
iztx4bh,Just Google local homeless shelters.  Also don't donate stuff to Goodwill if you want it to go to the homeless. They sell donated goods to fund job growth programs they run.  If you're close to San Antonio_ TX_ you can go directly to Haven for Hope which literally is the finest homeless rehabilitation facility on the planet. They have a donations depot where you can donate literally anything.  I attended that facility about two years ago. After I got housing_ Haven for Hope paid for my first two months of rent/utilities and furnished my whole apartment and gave me a bunch of clothes and a pair of shoes and work boots. A+ but hopefully I don't have to go again.,knoegel,FrugalLuxuryKitten,23,6,1,9,1231
izvv0l9,Since people have suggested similar_ but not this exact thing.  Go across the city_ grab some throwaway hangers.  Post them up like you would a sign on a telephone pole_ ask politely people take what they need and can wear in maybe a sign.  This is absolutely the most effective way_ as long as they're not expensive no homeless person is going to pass it up.  Although this may be rougher on rainy days_ you may have to ask to put them on bulletin boards.  You'd be surprised how many places would not turn that down.  A bar I worked at when I was young would have NO issue doing this (I seen a coat up there once or twice).  If they're very specific_ or people you want to help_ you should only take them to appropriate 3rd parties.  I may be a member of TST_ but I won't deny when a church does well_ bring them to a church.  They'll be handled by a human with decency.  On the flip side_ this makes it difficult for the homeless who need it but don't get around so easy.  Thus my suggestion of posting them on poles_ then everyone will see them.  Car dwellers_ tents_ rough sleepers_ couch surfers_ or even those that are on the brink of homelessness.  They'll appreciate it as well.,Sickologyy,FrugalLuxuryKitten,23,2,1,9,1231

izru093,"Awesome sauce! Good job on working your butt off to be able to get given a chance. What anyone that's never been homeless before don't realize is that SO MANY of us(& the % gets higher and higher every week) of reg people literally being a bad day away from ending up there themselves. And that these are the same people that ""think it's SO EASY_and there's ""SO MUCH HELP"" /s that if you DONT want to be homeless/on drugs/need mental health access is that all ya gotta do is snap your fingers and help rains down on you....that is THE FARTHEST thing from the truth!  And also the fact MOST homeless(it's just A SMALL VISABLE minority of folks that ""choose"" to be there or have been homeless and mentally ill with no help for so long they essentially become ""institutionalized"" like being in jail too late ng and DONT know HOW to live indoors and pay bills and stuff like that.) Are also the ones causing MOST of the problems that help ""normal"" people look down on domestically challenged folks all as useless_undeserving _thieving_drugged up_lying_lazy_ subpar(or not even) HUMAN.(NEVER understood THAT ONE) Or if there's no addiction/mental support health than SO MANY slip through the cracks..and the ""visible"" ones(not the people in their cars_families in RVs_working sober people living in tents_squats_couch surfing_etc) are the ones Not causing problems_but also do not receive much help. Others also forget that most ""free meals""/food banks are usually during working hrs so A LOT of people go hungry(or have to beg for food/$$ to get to work) AFTER working their new shifts waiting 2-3 wks for their first paycheque(I've dealt with that a few times)and the ONLY way I ever got off the streets was due to receiving help and chances from good people that were willing to take a chance on me.   And at least until you can find yourself a place_you can also afford to keep enough gas in your car to at least run it more and keep you 2 warmer throughout the night. Do you get to bring your animal to work? Chilling behind the counter or something? Of the support animal doesn't work_mention to them he/she can just be an added bonus of ""security"" or a cute pup to pet to maybe lure in more customers ;) or at least if they are in your car_ you can visit them during breaks.

izmvs9r,Not sure where you’re at but the first thing I would do is contact banks and any form of ID you have- report them as stolen. Then_ go to a local post office and ask to apply for a PO Box (they are free in my city). You get your id and forms sent to said afformentioned post box.   This is what I did when my ID was stolen from me and I was on the street. Since you are 18 there are no questions asked.   For survival tips_ try blend in with a crowd at all times. Try stay the night with friends or in a car if you have one. This is your best bet to stay safe. If not_ you can scrounge out an area for abandoned houses and camp there for a bit (it takes a bit of effort and patience but I used to do this). Or you can sleep in libraries_ airports_ hospitals or on bus/train routes. You can pretend you’re catching a flight in the morning or you’re waiting for someone at the hospital.   Visit local churches for assistance with money_ clothes_ hygiene products_ food stamps etc. Visit local pantries or food drives_ they will provide you with a hot meal_ no questions asked. Remember these people are happy to help no matter the situation.   This sort of thing really sucks and I’ve been through it before as well_ i hope that some of this information is able to help you. If you need any assistance I’d be happy to help best as I can_ please don’t be afraid to shoot me a message. Stay strong_ you will get through this ❤️  EDIT: I’m not going to ask about the mental illness because it’s not my place_ but is there any way that you wouldn’t have to disclose this information to potential employers? I mean I know that’s not the best advice - some places are willing to hire anyone as long as you can do the job correctly. Apply for interviews_ walk into places with signs that say hiring_ test your luck and see. I have clinical depression and at no point in my life have i said “I suffer from depression” at a job interview. Sure_ it’s the truth_ but do they need to know?  No.,Loud-Stable6924,SubPrincess2004,28,23,1,3,1530

izo9wbg,"Call the police.  If you are 18_ and she does not have some legal guardianship over you because of your mentall illness_ then you are a legal adult_ and she has no legal right to keep your ID.  I cannot speak to this ""credit card"" that you mention.... I don't know how easy it is for an 18 year old mentally ill person with no job history to get a credit card.  On the *one* hand_ these ""banks"" today might be willing to allow anyone who asks for a credit card to get one_ because creating debt is what makes them money.  On the *other* hand... I can't see how a credit card issuer would consider you a valid potential customer_ since you have NO WAY of demonstrating an ability to pay a credit card bill.  So_ I am not sure if you mean an ATM card for a bank account in your name_ or a ""credit card"" that is actually just a second card on your mother's credit card account_ so it isn't \*your\* account specifically_ but only gives you access to her account.... or an actual credit card.  At any rate_ if it is your credit card and your account_ you could_ as has been suggested_ call the card in stolen_ and get yourself another one.  If you have to_ you use General Delivery at your local post office_ for the new address they send the card to.  However... your ID is another matter altogether.  That's why you call the police.  When they arrive_ you tell them who you are_ and how old you are_ and you point out that you cannot PROVE this_ because she will not give you your ID.  She can SAY whatever she wants_ but they are going to WANT to see the ID for themselves_ if for no other reason than to confirm what you are saying.  I would not stop there_ however.  With the police present_ if she shows that she has the ID.... and again... no LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP over you... the police will force her to give it back to you.  You can use this momentum to get the copy of your birth certificate that she has.  Why is this birth certificate important?  Two reasons.  One...f you lose your ID_ you are going to NEED a copy of your birth certificate to get anther ID.  Two... when you need a copy of your birth certificate_ you are going to find out what a pain in the ass it can be to GET another copy.  So... get the one you kind-of have access to now... the one in your mother's possession.  With the police there forcing her to give you the ID_ you can have them also force her to give you the birth certificate.  Don't even bring up the credit card.  Again... call it in stolen_ and get another one issued to you.  If you bring it up because you want it and you won't let go of how you want it... she can obfuscate the issue by countering with how it is HER card_ since she pays the bill_ etc.  If the card and the account are yours_ and you are responsible for paying the bill... the piece of plastic she has can be made invalid_ and you can get another one with less hassle from the card company or bank.  What to pack in your backpack.... a phone charger if you have a phone_ a change of clothes_ an extra few sets of underwear and socks_ the bare minimum of personal hygiene products you can't survive without_ a notebook and a few pens and pencils_ your medications if there are any... that's getting kind of full now_ yeah?  You'll want a pillow and sleeping bag.  Your backpack can work as a pillow_ but people new to homelessness cringe at that.  Of course... a tent would be good as well... but that likely wouldn't fit into your backpack anyway_ just like the bedding won't fit INTO it.  You might have to tie or dangle the sleeping bag from the backpack.",bongart,SubPrincess2004,28,7,1,8,1024

j0muwvp,I need to check the history of the farm land my grandfather bought which was very close to our home_ but I believe he got it in the 80’s.  It was when interest rates were extremely high and some farms started failing.    It’s actually a bit historic because the community/neighbors would come to the bank auctions_ and would threaten any outsiders who appeared.  It was extremely organized on who bid on what.  Basically_ the community tried to get everything back to the family.  Sometimes there was an issue with the house and/or land_ so someone did have to buy that outright_ but they would rent that back to the previous owners.  In some cases_ a group of people would buy it.  Anyways_ I believe the farm land my grandfather bought was during this period.  The family that had been farming on it for a 100 years is still farming on it.  At my cousin’s wedding this summer_ some of them were there.  They did randomly bring up that “we” really need to increase the rent.  They feel guilty.  My dad and uncle both told them that they were “family” and rent wasn’t increasing.    Note: The rent doesn’t even cover the taxes.,cyberburn,Paczilla2,107,1,1,3,1530

izk4m3w,"Let's talk about my friends_ M&L first.  They are a couple I met a few years ago.  They wouldn't necessarily call themselves homeless.  They live out of one of those [Datsun RVs](https://www.google.com/search?q=Datsun+RV)?  The cute little ones that have the small Datsun (err.. pre-Nissan) front_ and the small full RV cabover on the back?  Their rig has a punch-out for the dining area as well.  Once a year_ they go up to the Dakotas/Montana_ and they work harvesting sugar beets.  They each come away... after between a month and six weeks... with between $3500 and $5000.  They then proceed to live on that (maybe) $10k_ for the rest of the year.  The rest of the year will consist of them spending a few months here in the winter/spring_ living cheaply... and living with friends/family for a few weeks (out of their RV) in cooler summer locations in NY state_ Michigan_ etc.  They will go from hot springs (wherever)... to rubber tramp locations like Quartzsite... to open BLM land.  Occasionally_ when the party is hard on their wallet_ one might take a few weeks with light work.  Sometimes L will get work at the Fountain of Youth springs up the road from here_ as it is also a trailer park with amenities.  Once or twice a week_ sure... nothing to support anything other than what they might want to drink and smoke while they are in the slabs.  And that's how they live.  On the one hand_ they have their home on their back.  For them_ they can ""rely"" on friends and family_ because their demands are always extremely light... they bring their own food_ shelter_ power_ money.  They just need a place to park it.  They make friends wherever they go_ and they make connections... and most of the time_ those connections are like this...  >Hey M... we are renting a cabin/getting a boat with a few friends.  Why don't you and L come out and stay?  Not like a rich_ bourgeois thing.  These people were slabbing it up with them the previous season_ living just as dirty.  These people making the offer might have stayed at M&L's camp while here in the slabs_ and were ""repaying the favor"".  But.... that gives M&L a target to get to... and that eats up two months of the year.  Spots like Pagosa Springs_ this place... pretty soon_ they have to CHOOSE between where they want to go_ as opposed to struggling to find just one.  Are they homeless?  Technically... yes.  I've sat and have had many a smoke-filled conversation with M to know that they are disillusioned with enough of today's crap_ that this is their way of tuning out as much as they can.  It was a conscious_ if not even a subconscious decision on their part.  I'm sure they both gravitated this way before realizing it was the life they wanted.  Homeless by choice.  Nomads.  But when you rotate the point of view out_ and get a wider picture.... it is what they choose to DO with homelessness that is the forest we should be seeing.  Again_ they have nothing ""permanent"" to fall back on_ should things fall apart.  Except maybe limping here.  There are a few of those Dolphin/Datsun campers here that aren't ever leaving... in one piece.  Tried pulling one out of the clay once with my 1989 S10 4x4_ when I first got here.  That didn't happen.  Poor S10. Best $400 I spent in 2015.  Lived in it... carried me 1300 miles from WA to here_ with only three shock absorbers.  Good four year investment.  What makes them different from someone with a backpack and shoe leather?  The camper_ for one.  Yes_ that was shrewd spending on their part... but really... that's not as hard a hurdle as one might imagine.  The trick was getting to where the money was being handed out like candy_ in exchange for ""short"" bursts of labor intensive work.  ***Sprint for a month_ coast for a year***.  I know a few homeless folk who do seasonal work in tourist towns.  These are places that see huge swells in the population only during certain seasons... and many employers will provide housing as well as a paycheck.  The work could be selling T-shirts and beach towels 40 hours a week_ in an air-condition store 100 yards from the ocean_ in a town where everything \*you\* need (food_ booze_ substances_ companionship_ entertainment_ etc) is within walking distance.  And you live above the place where you work_ and you can work in a t-shirt_ shorts_ and flip-flops.  And you get paid cash_ every week with a bonus if you last the full ""season"".    The people I know take the money_ save most of it_ and either use it to fund their ""adventures"" over the winter_ or they get a place in town (cheaper_ with the severe off-season population drop)_ or they go to a different seasonal spot_ and do the same thing.  Provincetown_ MA and Key West_ FL are popular in this regard.  Both cater to tourism heavily_ both see dramatic differences between in-season and off-season populations_ and their seasons compliment each other.  There are many homeless who just bounce back and forth between these two locations_ living in places they don't own or rent that are provided by their employers_ working for cash_ and usually living hard in their downtime.  They aren't on the streets_ because they found a loophole.  When all you have to save_ is the cost of the bus ticket to the place you spend your winter... where you'll be doing the same thing until you only need the bus ticket to where you spend the summer.... and your signature holds you to nothing... you are homeless.  There are other names... but that one still fits.  There needs to be a willingness to move_ as much as the ability to move.  If one is able to work a harvest_ then it is only a matter of that individual being willing to do whatever it takes to GET to that harvest.  Once it is over... once that month or six weeks is done_ there's like $5000 to go and GET some kind of vehicle with.  I'm not even talking the legalities... but it is very easy to prove residency in South Dakota_ with a single night's stay in a motel (aka the receipt)_ and that can be turned around into a license_ and registration for the vehicle you just worked to buy.  At the harvest in that state.  If one needs all of that in one go... there are other states_ and other harvests.  Now... moving stuff around from city to city isn't as much of a problem.  What about what was given up to get the vehicle?  Depends on what was given up.  If it was a tent and camp set up that was finally weather-proof?  You now have a metal and glass shell on wheels to provide a mobile camp.  You can go BACK to where you were_ if you want to.. but now you can go ANYWHERE much faster than before.  When you ask this question... what is the image in your head that you are working from?  Are you looking around you_ wondering what you would do with it all if you were to go homeless?  Are you seeing a tent_ or a tent camp_ and wondering how those people would pack up all of that if someone came along and said ""move""?  Do you imagine that there's a number of people who regularly migrate between homeless tent camps and emergency shelter concentrations (there are_ btw)?  Some reduce what they have_ to what they can carry on their backs... even if they don't move around from city to city.  This is a very secure way to be homeless_ because everything you have_ can be with you all the time.  In regards to mobility_ it is more about being homeless in an area that is hostile to homelessness... where you can never fully depend on any location you choose as being actually secure.  So you need to be able to move without losing anything_ on short notice.  That's why I ask about what inspired the question.... homeless individuals are... individuals.  There's more than half a million of them in the USA alone.  At one point_ I saved for a train_ instead of taking the bus.  I carted luggage_ and two heavy stacks of boxes that SHOULD have been cargo_ but I was exceptionally pathetic and got it all allowed at every station.  Even got one of those big_ wood and metal_ four-wheel hand-trucks in almost every station I needed one.  Fuckin Chicago.  Not the city... just that day in that train station.  That day hurt.  It was in the middle of digging myself out of one homeless situation_ staring down a Northeastern winter_ to be homeless in the pacific Northwest.  Not Seattle.  I mean... I came into Seattle on the train... but I was there for like... and hour_ maybe?  I did get back there for another hour or so_ a few years later.  That's how I moved with my stuff_ from city to city_ when I was homeless in... what... 2013?  In 2018_ I used that S10 I mentioned earlier... that I was living in at the time_ to move me and my stuff from WA to southern CA.  So_ personally_ I've found that the method of moving my stuff_ depends on what I'm moving_ and how I'm getting there.  And if my getting there depends on what I've got... I get rid of shit until it isn't a problem anymore.",bongart,UndisturbedMountain,7,3,2,8,1024

I live in the USA_ as do most readers here_ and apparently yourself_ so the implied nation is the USA.  But we are talking about two different features of taxes: 1) The levels at which taxes kick in_ and 2) the deductions off of those taxes which promote/discourage certain activities by the taxpayer.  The more that #2 is done well_ the less objection I have to #1.  Conversely_ the worse #2 is done_ the more I am concerned about #1.  On the question of homelessness ( which is the issue at hand ) the incentives for the average citizen in the USA are greatly distorted.  This leads to over-investment by homeowners_ excessive NIMBYism_ and consequent rising housing costs.  =================================================  If I were king_ the incentives would be reversed.  Income tax would be abolished_ with all of its loopholes and perverse incentives.  ( Why should we have any tax on productive activity? )  It would be replaced with property taxes on the ground value of their property ( AKA just the dirt ).  This gives all homeowners an incentive to keep the land use small_ which is an environmental plus.  Government programs would be mostly paid for by the rich.  ( They would pay taxes on their mansions directly_ and indirectly on the cost of the Lambo because the dealership would have to cover its property taxes. )  There would be one_ and only one deduction.  Each homeowner would get a personal deduction of about 50K on the value of their property.  Everything above that would be taxable.  This would put small homes - averaging 1000-1400 sqft like almost everyone had in the fifties - in reach of even minimum wage earners.,ThroarkAway,nip_pickles,45,2,3,11,964

iza3nbh,Let's see.  [What does HUD have to say about Florida?](https://resources.hud.gov/)  HUD... the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  They are the ones behind Section 8_ Section 811_ and the Housing Choice Voucher system.  As it turns out... they have a few other tricks up their sleeve.  HUD also provides subsidies to apartment complexes_ in exchange for having a certain number of apartments set aside for low income residents.  You don't need Section 8/811/HCV to get one of these apartments... you just have to make below a certain amount of money.  In most cases_ it is also similar to a Section 8_ in that you only have to pay a third of what you make_ for your rent.  The link above_ is to the HUD Resource Locator. You'd want to choose to Find Affordable Housing Near Me.... the overlay that pops up first has that as the first option to the top left.  Click that.  It will pull data from your connection as to where you are_ and show you all the apartment complexes near you that got subsidies from HUD_ and therefore have apartments set aside.    The resource locator also will show you any USDA low income housing.  An example would be a farm house on USDA land.  Residents wouldn't be required to farm the land... that was already being taken care of.  But... there's still a farm house there.  Someone should live in it... and the USDA works with HUD to make this possible and affordable.  Most of these end up being tax credit properties_ but not all.  And... it shows other low income tax credit properties within urban areas.... but those would be more expensive in the short run_ because you'd be expecting to get the money back when you filed your taxes.  IE... why it is a tax credit property.  I just threw Tallahassee in the search to see what was in Florida.  Within the ring_ there are 14 apartment complexes with low income apartments_ and 11 tax credit property listings.... and the Public Housing Authority location for Tallahassee... where you'd go first if you were looking for low income housing there.  So... find the nearest Public Housing Authority.  Use the Resource Locator to get an idea where the apartments and properties are in your area.,bongart,According_Fox_2460,5,1,1,8,1024

izaulcc,2. Access to cleaning facilities was definitely missed.

I also missed being able to poop in peace. I've never been one of those quick 30-second poopers; I relax and take my time_ just let it flow_ listen to whalesong. Instead it's public toilet stalls with those weird fucking gaps everywhere and you make awkward eye-contact with people also coming in to take a dump.  3. When I first became homeless I was sleeping rough (on the streets) and I feel you on this one. Sandwiches_ salads_ and cold pasta every day. That or junk food. I definitely missed cooking_ as it was a hobby of mine. I was lucky when_ in my second stint of homelessness_ I wound up living in a few homeless veteran camps that had rudimentary cooking facilities. That was refreshing and fun.  6. Don't write this off. I got more companionship and ass in the ~5 years I was homeless than I did in the 15 years before that. I've dated plenty of girls who were homed while I was not - and they were fully aware I was homeless. I've also been with homeless women too and just recently got out of a nearly 3-year long relationship with a homeless woman I met in a homeless camp. We're both homed (separately) now. Don't write off dating just because you're homeless; plenty of women don't mind.  I SO feel you on losing your cat_ I really do. Myself and the girlfriend I mentioned above got a cat just after we got out and moved in together. After we split up_ this year has been fucking *rough* for me financially and I've come perilously close to returning to homelessness.

iz6i4v6,I remember getting a Subway in New York City and wondering why all the people were on one side of the train while I sat down on the empty side. A few seconds later I realized it's because the only other person on this side of the train smelled strongly of raw sewage. They had clearly s*** their pants and were just sitting in it.  It ended up becoming a source of amusement as I joined the people on the other side of the train and we proceeded to watch people have the same experience stop after stop. That was probably the most disheartening homeless experience I witnessed in New York City but certainly not the only one like the man who was screaming at the sky sidewalk in Brooklyn. I can understand why a city would need to commit people who are like that for the sake of sanitation and order.  Of course there's the worry that this will be over broadly implemented and simply lead to the incarceration of people for poverty.,PurpleDancer,exgalactic,37,6,1,3,1530

izht78h,to be honest_ little of what is passed in regards to homelessness has any effect on us. we are simply there to provide basic life support and first aid to those who need it and transport them to definitive care. once again_ i can’t speak much to what happens at that level as i am not involved in that part.  EMT’s aren’t a tool for the state in regard to trying to “solve” homelessness. it’s just simply the nature of our job and that civilians will make calls about the homeless guy who looks like he might be dead laying on wilshire_ or the homeless lady who is sitting in a pool of blood screaming at the sky on santa monica blvd_ or the homeless guy who is running naked on the 405. yes i have seen all of those things.  my personal opinion in general? im not a fan of newsom at all. but the government of california itself can’t be solely responsible for the rampant homelessness here. by virtue of the nice weather and sheer population that is bound to happen. there’s also a misconception that california made it legal to allow homeless encampments to exist_ but that was product of a federal lawsuit if i remember correctly. that being said_ i will once again reiterate that nobody should be harassed simply for existing. having been homeless i understand. but there comes a point when there are homeless who have no intention of doing anything with their life besides doing drugs in their encampments. that’s just not good any way you look at it. or_ as aforementioned_ the mentally ill homeless who desperately need care but wouldn’t even know how to get off the street if that was even a thought going through their mind. those people do exist.   i think they are doing what they can but at this point it’s too far gone and i don’t think they will ever be able to solve it. working fairly closely with police i can also tell you they have a very hands off approach. not enough people and too much to deal with_ i feel bad for those guys. if somebody is not a threat to themself or somebody else or their property they will pretty much ignore it and any ordinance they are supposed to be enforcing. it’s not worth it to them.,treyj88,exgalactic,37,2,2,8,1024

iz3jx3y,Used much of the advice shared here when I had to make my way out to NC.  Came in super handy. Wipes_ are the way to go…never tried corn starch though for body powder. Hmm.  Ended up saving my plastic grocery bags for…well everything.  Cleaned up a bit in a laundromat bathroom that had terrible lighting and toilet paper_ but thankfully my bag had a strap and clips I could hang off of the doors bulky hinges to pull stuff out easier.  Ended up finding a community center once to use_ since I wasn’t going to be in the area long.  Also_ lucked out at a boat dock and separate park close by…both had bathroom facilities. Coldish_ but everything was there. Rotated use.  The boat dock had showers; however_ those were locked with keypad locks. One of the things I’d do in my spare time was pick up a grocery bag of trash_ every so often…some park maintenance employees came by to clean up and so I asked them about it.  That’s when the one guy was nice enough to point out that the women’s door lock was broken (I had never checked it). He thought maybe some young kids or something broke in.  The light dial was broken and of a timer design. Took a few minutes for me to figure out that the head of a standard house key could be used to turn it.  The guy didn’t think the water would be warm_ it actually got plenty hot though. Now the room was cold-that day and time the weather was bearable enough.  The next times I used it…just tried to balance the timing out with the higher temps of the day. No mornings.  I made sure to strap the door since it didn’t lock…just in case someone happened to open it up while I was in.  Other than that_ I had an emergency bucket in my vehicle I hoped to never use again.  For a urinal though…by chance I had a Large Lysol dish detergent jug this time.  Like 220 ounces or something. Best urinal I’ve used yet. Lemon fresh.,missfire23,johndoe_detroit,45,4,1,3,1530

iz65vn8,I feel to share with you something I found out from my friend that can be of help to you in preparing you for the journey. My friend walked the Camino De Santiago in Europe this year which is apparently a 500 mile stretch that about 350k people walk every year. To me it seems so intense and yet there are humans that willingly do this as a pilgrimage of sorts. They say on average it takes 30 days. Maybe with can read up on preparation docs for that? I know that there are hostels along the way so obviously that part will be different..  maybe you can carry a tent? And another little piece of inspiration that may be of help to you_ there is a woman called Peace pilgrim walked for 30000 miles for peace with nothing but the clothes on her back. She had a shirt that said on the back what she was doing and people offered her stuff but she never asked.  To me that was wild to contemplate.

iyx4eqm,This question gets asked a lot and I always say to people who ask this:  Ask yourself what YOU would NEED if you were homeless or camping for an extended period of time. That's your answer. Think about what you would need to Survive on a winters night in a city when you know you have no where to sleep or stay warm. What would you personally do?  But to your points. 1: Food is really easy to come by as long as you don't care where you get it/find it. leftovers on the street_ entire pizzas in dumpsters_ starbucks dumpsters_ etc. You have to be careful when providing snacks to people. think about allergies_ think about how their teeth are. Many homeless people have really bad gums and teeth and can't eat what you normally eat. Apples? out of the question no way in hell I'd be able to eat an apple when I was homeless as I'd likely lose a tooth if I bit into one. Same with hard granola bars. Soft food is the best option if you want to provide snacks but really a snack isn't going to fill someones needed calory count for the day nor will it fix hunger. Trust me when you're homeless you're hungry 24/7.  2. Underarmor socks were great. Cheap socks will last a couple days at most. Really the only good quality socks are going to be over $20 for a pack. anything under $20 I guarantee you will be torn up in a week or two.  3. Not really.   4. no  5. Gift Cards. Giftcards to a 24 hour coffee shop even better. But grocery giftcards also. allows someone to buy what they know they can eat and get the most calories out of the food.  But yeah don't think things like this. Eating nutritious food isn't something that anyone_ at least that I knew when I was homeless_ even thinks about. It's about calories. The more the better because that's what will keep you moving throughout the day.,UsefulWoodpecker6502,ResidentGrape9517,5,3,1,1,7

It's unfair but there really is a stigma against people who shop at pantries that's kind of less than and it's unfair.

Because I would think that any food kitchen is going to serve what is nutritionally considered to be a balanced meal with protein, vegetables, etc. It's not like they're serving pizza every night.
zciue7,,iyxnytv,The food banks in my city require a person to be registered and approved. Usually they are only open once or twice a month.   A food kitchen provides anyone who comes in a cooked meal no matter what their income is. Usually daily.
zciue7,,iz1d9gm,The food bank in my city is open to everyone 5 days a week, no questions asked. But you're only allowed to come once a week.   Then we also have pantries that hand out the boxes to people once a week but you have to register for that.
zciue7,,iz1fl0c,I love that! Unfortunately, I'm not approved at the best one in the city because I'm a sponsored permanent resident. Even though I'm no longer with my sponsor with no job currently. I'm working with the Y to find another where I'll be approved.
zciue7,,iz1gslz,They give you 4 empty grocery bags and let you shop for the food you want. Normally it's one bag filled with breads, one bag filled with produce, 1 bag for dessert (my favorite!) and also non-perishables and then one bag for meats/frozen goods.   But hobos call it angel food because you gotta listen to a church sermon before getting the food.
zciue7,,iz51itz,What city if you don't mind my asking? I live in Montréal. I've always found it homeless/low income friendly especially compared to cities in the US I've lived. There are a lot of food banks.   >angel food  I got a chuckle out of this. Most of the homeless people I've known have a good sense of humour.
zciue7,,iz57e8o,Raleigh, North Carolina
zciue7,iyxvea4,,Ok, I understand now. We don’t really have food kitchens where I live. There are a couple of shelters and at least one church that serve a meal. More commonly we have various outreach or volunteer groups that bring cooked meals to distribute at a common location like a park or they stop and distribute at a few of the larger encampments.   In my experience the food served in the shelters and a lot of what is passed out by outreach is very *institutional* and frankly pretty gross. I’m sure they are going for quantity over quality.   All in all I agree that food stamps/EBT/SNAP whatever you want to call it is the best way to go. A lot of people supplement that with one or two trips to the food bank.
zciue7,iz1crme,,Yes, they do offer healthier selections. They get fresh produce by the pallets and have farms dedicated solely to the food bank.   The National Guard came and worked on our farms during the quarantine.
zciue7,,iz1dk7e,A lot of people are getting the max amount on SNAP because of the pandemic. So people who only qualified for $15 per month have been getting like $270 per month since 2020 because of the national emergency.

zciijw,iyxoema,,Durable outerwear is key, obviously make what money you have go as far as possible.  Online purchases are the hardest for me in a pinch when my reg bank acct is messed up. However, go online to the Rothco site and search up Ranger pantie. They're short pt shorts. They dry super fast, you can literally swim/shower in them and towel off and be dry, thereby cutting down on some of your laundry expenses. Get about 3 pairs. It'll cost you about 72bux online. Or, go to any Mil surplus store and search for the Rothco brand. Soffee is good too but not as opaque.

zchal9,iyxc7z6,,I was homeless for 6 months a good chunk of that time in winter so it couldn't have been a worse scenario. I used to tarp in a hole in the middle to erect a kind of rough tent to put cardboard on the ground keep somewhat insulated and had a mylar blanket and a sleeping bag. As for washing up it was hell but luckily there was my library nearby and they had a single stall so I would literally take my products and sink shower pretty much daily. I'm pretty sure the library probably knew what I was doing since I would come out with wet hair but they let me do it because they knew me beforehand. It allowed me to keep my dignity by at least being presentable. People will still treat you overall decently if you look decent. I would store my dirty clothes in a garbage bag and when I got two full I go to the laundromat and wash my clothes. Sometimes I would have to collect bottles to have enough quarters to do my clothes but I managed.
zchal9,iyxxqxe,,off and on about 4 or 5 years now. currently homeless in LA since march, before that i was in oregon. i sleep wherever i can. sometimes bus, sometimes bench. i have a locker at the gym where i wash and shower before i go to work. i wash dishes for about 40-45 hours a week and take up extra gig work wherever i can. i finished my undergrad this past spring so am now just saving money taking things day by day.

zchal9,iyx4y58,,I was homeless on and off for around 5 years. The most I'd spend outside was a few months at a time but I was mostly surviving in nature. Washing isnt impossible and easier in the summer. I used to go to this creek in the woods and bathe in it once every few days while the water was ice cold it was kinda nice considering the heat. I suppose any natural water source can be a bath if it's clean and not stagnant.
zchal9,iyyayt0,,The first time I panhandled to make ends meet. The 2nd time I had SSI at the time, so it helped. The third and final time, I sold newspapers all day, held signs on the weekend, and went to day labor, and that that allowed me to rent a small room that was horrible. Now I am a college grad, going for my degree in social work, and I have a job working with teens who have mental health issues and drug problems.
zchal9,iywo4a0,,I was street homeless (no vehicle or whatever) for 5 years. I slept/lived in many places. My favorite spot was under a bridge that had a concrete platform and it was divided into sections by concrete walls. They made perfect little rooms. We hung a curtain across the front and it was perfect. I’ve also lived in tents in all sorts of locations, under freeway overpasses, hidden away behind sound walls, etc. I stayed in various abandoned buildings from time to time and even lived in an old traffic courthouse.   I can vividly remember brushing my teeth at a water fountain in a city park in the summer of 2015. I would bird bath in public restrooms, sometimes I would even wash my hair in the sink. I had a gym membership for a while but they went out of business. In the summer I would usually just shower at my spot. I would hang up a tarp like a shower curtain but making a full circle and then shower in there. I hated carrying water so I learned to be very efficient with it. I was able to fully shower and wash my hair with **one** gallon of water if necessary. For getting and storing water I had a couple of the 5 gallon water cooler jugs, you can find them in dumpsters behind businesses and apartments. I would take them in a shopping cart or a folding grocery cart to a nearby park and fill them up either at a water fountain (by filling a smaller bottle over and over, very tedious) or I would use a pair of pliers so I could use the hose spigot.   When you’re homeless you are almost always passively scouting resources. This becomes so ingrained that even now that I have been indoors for two years, I still find myself noticing outdoor water spigots and power outlets.  Edit to add: also having baby wipes on hand at all times was mandatory.
zchal9,,iyxyd1n,that babywipe tip needs to be in the how to be homeless 101 bible

iyx30m7,Friend_ you're doing more than enough.  Time to stop beating on yourself.  As another user pointed out_ we should have a system to prevent people from becoming homeless_ like they do in so many other (poorer!) countries.  Your didn't create your situation_ and the fact that you haven't found your way out yet isn't on you.  [Luck alone dictates 80% of our outcomes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/).  You're applying to jobs and applying for SNAP and asking for help.  You're doing just fine_ effort-wise.  Here are some links to info about food banks in Miami:  * [https://www.foodpantries.org/ci/fl-miami](https://www.foodpantries.org/ci/fl-miami) * [https://www.foodbanks.net/miami-fl/](https://www.foodbanks.net/miami-fl/) * [Yelp's 10 best food banks in Miami](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=foodbanks&find_loc=Miami%2C+FL)  Those should be able to get you over the hump while you're waiting for SNAP to kick in.  This last suggestion is guaranteed to annoy_ but I promise it comes from a place of science.  Once you've secured enough to eat_ make sure you get some exercise everyday!  Exercise will boost your energy levels and you'll feel less depressed.  If you like animals_ check out one of the [animal shelters](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=animalshelters&find_loc=Miami%2C+FL).  Oftentimes the staff are happy to let people hang out with some dogs and cats for a while.  Can be a good source of happy brain chemicals (oxytocin).  Keep your head up!

iyx9gs1,I am surprised DD let you do it without proof of insurance of course if you pay monthly DD doesnt stay on top of these monthly . Live in your car for a few months at least you have that. Once the car gets towed or impounded you will be even more screwed. Take any job that will hire you but you should try to park on private  property somewhere with permission so your car doesnt get impounded.  If you cannot afford insurance_ then you really have no choice but to sell the car pocket whatever money you get after paid off. maybe rent a room for a few months and start all over again,Desperate-Long359,Busy-Character-845,37,3,4,3,1530
iyygijg,If i were there_ I'd head to key west_ get a fishing pole and a small grill_ and get a job cleaning tables_ and other odd jobs. Or go to the Gold Coast side. FL can be a brutal place to be homeless_ but there are places which are very open to people who are trying.  You should also go to indeed.com and search for Keller Williams and Kaiser technical college Real Estate licensing course. It's free. It's a lot of really boring information_ but once you get licensed_ you can either work as a realtor or a home inspector_ or both. It's what I'm working on.

Honestly_ the answers are as unique as we are. For me_ I was on the street because I have a disability that worsened until I was no longer able to work anymore. I get a small Social Security check but I couldn’t afford to live anywhere on that. At the time I was living with my ex-boyfriend and his family. Things went south in the relationship_ he started getting physical with me_ eventually his family kicked us out.

iyy337l,Well... I needed to care for my dad who had dimentia. I moved from my apartment to his house in another state_ and so I had to change jobs. I didn't make as much as my last job_ but I was going to be living there_ so I thought the difference in wages lost would be made up by not having to pay for rent. Of all my siblings_ I was making the least and I was the youngest with no kids so it made sense that I take the responsibility.   So_ things are humming along for a little under a year and then my dad_ while going for a walk_ fell and broke his hip. This was really the start of the end. The medical bills were piling up and his dementia grew very bad. He eventually healed but his mental state was very bad. I had to stay with him longer and longer and all the while my debts grew because I wasn't able to work as much and his medical expenses grew. Now_ he owned his house outright and it was agreed between me and my siblings and my father that because I was taking it upon myself alone to take care of him_ I would be the sole owner of the house when he passed. (You can see where this is going). So_ two years later I am deep in debt_ but I'm not worried because I can sell the house and salvage my life. Dad dies. My siblings immediately contest my dad's will saying he was not in his right mind when he wrote it. I have no real money to hire an attorney. I go into a pretty deep depression after having my brothers and sister basically turn on me all for a piece of dad's house. It sells_ I get one fifth of the proceeds which doesn't cover all the debt I'm in. Depression gets worse_ I stay with a friend until I wear out my welcome (not her fault_ I basically stayed in bed for three months and had crying fits around her children). I stayed in a shelter and basically had everything stolen. Lost my IDs_ documents_ but I didn't care. I was sexually assaulted several times_ but I was numb to the world. I just didn't care. I eventually wandered down from Washington to Oregon where some nice people took care of me. Then a new person joined the group and things got ugly. Made my way down to California and I'm here now.   So_ yeah. That's my story. It's not that rare. A lot of people are one medical emergency from being in financial trouble. It doesnt have to be drugs or alcohol or mental illness or whatever else people think of us. I've meet people who lost it all over a broken wrist_ a fire_ all it takes is for one domino to fall and then...,ladyinatent,Mcpot11,6,3,1,3,1530

iz1ld70,For me_ it was leaving a toxic relationship_ and having to build a life on my own. I had to move away from the city I was in_ leave my decent salary job behind_ and stay with family. The extreme stress and undiagnosed PTSD made it impossible to get hired anywhere_ and gradually money and resources just ran out. Also_ getting off of antidepressants and benzodiazepines_ which are some of the most difficult withdrawal symptoms.  I'm back on my feet now_ but those events set me back for about 5 years of nomadic life. I think for a lot of people_ it's a snowball of bad luck in a short amount of time.

There’s also many jobs that are very fast paced and physically exhausting on the body like construction which can take a toll on your body. People wanna know why people are entitled well it’s because of things like this. If you’re also disabled mentally in any way shape or form_ the system easily works against you. The education system also doesn’t teach you how to do many things like make coffee or make a hamburger in a fast paced way but they can teach you trigonometry and on top of that the cost of living isn’t getting any better and wages have been stagnant.,Camthegreat1234,Mcpot11,6,2,1,8,1024

He's a toxic manipulator and threatened her with divorce when she brought me back.  The system is broken [by design]_ and from what I observed and heard personally_ the social services are inadequate at best_ at worst a joke.

iyz3og5,In my area the best paying jobs are $18/hr (most are $12-14/hr) while the lowest rent is $1500/month.. My body couldn't handle working 60-80 hours a week anymore to just sleep and store my stuff in a leaky rat infested apartment and struggling to do that. All while my sleazy landlord who literally lives in a mansion in the richest city in the state kept raising the rent so he could go on lavish vacations around the world with his trophy wife (yes_ I checked his Facebook profile to find that out_ lol).   The last straw for me was one night I heard a rat scratching and chewing inside the wall right next to a power outlet. The next morning I woke up and saw rat feces on the pillow next to me and realized I was better off putting all my stuff in storage and just sleeping in my car. So that's where I am now. I'm sick of breaking my back just for some rich pos to reap all the benefits.  In this area there's zero help for the poor. No shelters_ no public transit. Nothing. And on top of that the police actively keep the homeless population away. They run off people sleeping in their cars (like me) and will even pick up those without transportation and drop them off at the city/county line and tell them to not come back. Mind you that's usually out in the middle of nowhere and this area still has a known sizable population of coyotes and even the occasional mountain lion.,ineedhelp9999999,Mcpot11,6,1,1,3,1530
iz2i7ew,It was only a matter of time before inflation outpaces the ability to pay rent or afford cost of living. The push to force most people into renting is not by accident. This country was not intended to be a nation of renters but many people have no other choice now. Which means that they are not free. You have that hanging over your head constantly_ worrying about something as basic as a residence nobody can throw u out of. Imagine how much theft occurs from pple who rent. All that money they could use to buy a small plot of land and a small home they could have afforded but can’t because they make it a crime to be poor_ forcing u to rent making other pple rich while u are paying for your premature death thru eventual homelessness bc of having to give most of your earnings to landlords in your prime healthy years.,Difficult_Ad_9392,Mcpot11,6,1,2,3,1530

I got involved in inhalants_ thats when things got a bit rocky some legal trouble lost a few jobs_ but still held it together and was getting sober when all hell broke loose.  My addiction problem was almost entirely a byproduct of severe depression and bipolar_ 3 years ago they changed my medication and I had about the worst possible side effects sending me into a psychotic break with hallucinations_ during this I assaulted someone which I have no memory of_ they continued to give me the medication in jail for 2 weeks during which I continued to hallucinate and didn't even know I was in jail.  Finally they pulled my meds and I came out of it.  Because of my history the courts wouldn't believe in the psych issue and I ended up with a felony.  Once I got out of jail everything I had was gone and I had no job nowhere to go.  I bounced around halfway houses and finally a transitional housing/rehab that i currently reside in.

The rate at which I am paid I suppose to be above poverty level_ at the lower end of middle class_ but with the current economy it's more around half of what the local poverty level is. After the COVID restrictions were lifted_ landlords in Lynchburg_ VA were evicting people to renovate and raise rent. The last apartment I rented was nearly condemned_ with the windows falling out_ little to no insulation_ full of bugs and not in a good area. When the renter offered me another apartment_ it was worse and nearly 60% more expensive. That would have been the third apartment from this landlord_ the first one had leaking pipes and a puddle on the floor that you couldn't keep dry and fungi growing out of the walls.

This thermal shelter was largely non-preachy but a lot of the unpaid volunteers were from churches and wanted to chat.    I hated seeing him with a wind burned face looking cold_ but it was his choice.  Edit: there were also specific times people had to be places and that conflicted with more than one person's ability to stay in the shelter.

The government notoriously underfunds any service that impoverished people use_ in order to discourage its use.  Homeless shelters try to make up for being underfunded by having volutneers help_ but most volunteers get scared away from it after one shift.  &#x200B;  America definitely needs to do better with their homeless shelters.,-Ok-Perception-,Known-Ad2272,17,12,1,6,521

Where I live there aren't any shelters yet.  There are some 15-30 minutes away by car on a good traffic day.  The first soup kitchen showed up in 2015 in my county/city.

iyskfar,I've been in college towns before. Very different from college cities though. When the college is the major reason for the town_ it's pretty awesome. When it's like Houston or Chicago_ not so much. Every May there's just a bunch of free stuff on the curbs because students move out. Dumpster diving is a gold mine. Frats do volunteering and there's also student ministries so the soup kitchens and coat drives are always doing well. It's cleaner_ richer_ and these kids will just give you food or money. BUT please be aware_ if you scare them_ the cops will be on your ass right away. Never be pushy_ never stand directly in front of a business to fly a sign. You will be able to tell by their body language right away if you scare them. Don't push your luck and you can live a very comfortable life.,ladyinatent,Known-Ad2272,6,9,1,3,1530
iyto6m7,Well explained. Thank you.  My own college town experience was somewhat similar_ with the exception that at times some homeless were undoubtedly harassed/abused.   I’d like to say mostly this wasn’t the case though. Most people were kind and understanding.   Football game days were here and there_ typically before the game was alright…it was after the game you had to be careful. No matter who you are.   Got some of my own furniture freebies at the end of semesters.   Ten years ago there used to be quite a few abandoned houses that many squatted in…I personally don’t recall any issues. However_ after moving away and over the years of revisiting the area…things have changed drastically and those houses were (I’ll say lightly_ claimed) and renovated.  No abandoned houses exist in the area that I’m aware of anymore due to the market.  There used to be several empty lots that now have houses built on them now_ one we used to gather around on_ with a small camp fire and just have good times.  It’s changed a lot for sure. So much that I personally have lost interest in going by when I’m in the area.,missfire23,Known-Ad2272,6,1,3,3,1530

It’s the south and the administration is very conservative_ there’s large distances between any place you could potentially sleep and the places you could panhandle_ if you even could. Although the college area is very rich_ the college is supported by a labor pool of poor black folks that live outside of town in old crumbling flats. The police purposefully patrol the old color lines in between these areas so that getting back and forth is difficult.,EndAllHierarchy,Known-Ad2272,6,2,2,3,1530

There was a compartment in the floor where I kept my powdered milk mix in a glass jug_ wrapped in wet cloth- it stayed surprisingly cold that way.

iyrnoma,This is nearly impossible.   There are wildernesses left in some parts of the country that you could probably walk miles into and never see another person_ and basically be free to build what you can.   But it's going to be very_ very far from the closest Walmart_ grocery store_ traditional resources_ and you'll require bare minimum .270 rifle and tons of ammo_ lots of cold weather gear_ all traditional survival gear_ and even as an enthusiast I really don't know how you can dry more than a few pounds of meat before a kill goes bad in summer_ maybe if you had tons of huge drying racks and tinder and wood set up_ and drying meat is an acquired skill_ as hunters we take a cooler and ice the meat. And any place with sufficient big game will also have predator animals_ I think the ideal area would have big game like elk_ moose_ or caribou and black but not brown bears_ you don't wanna play with brown bears_ black ones aint really shit and just another food source.  Also I've studied wild plants extensively_ but even if you get to know wild plants_ you'll really only know everything about one given area and if you go 100 km you'll only recognize a few things_ and it is dangerous business the phone and identifying apps are a game changer. From some old illustration in a book you'd probably confuse Queen Anne's lace for hemlock_ whoops lol  Most homeless people are staying in wooded/undeveloped areas bordering cities_ undeveloped land often exists in midsized cities along the river in floodzones. In these areas_ I have seen people build shanties or shacks and the like_ and I've heard of dudes set up for ten or twenty years_ but as times change these places become more scarce and more likely for police to run through_ which is one reason why people who accept or embrace homelessness rather than go to shelter and try to get two jobs are typically always moving around and only possess and invest into what they can carry.   What you're looking for is homesteading_ which is a dead practice that no longer exists anywhere in the world_ and we are all forced to either obey our masters as landless peasants or face heavy persecution_ the entire planet is colonized by central banks cheers,Decent_Froyo_5530,Liquidmemer,138,7,1,3,1530

iz3bw4t,I really mean this_ thankyou so much for doing this op. It really can help people and honestly the human element of someone caring can mean as much as the items themselves.  Honestly fruit and sandwiches are not ideal for a lot of people.  small bags of chips like the ones you get in a party pack_ peanut butter crackers snacks_ granola bars or fruit bars are all great. Anything easy on the stomach and tasty is really good. If you can think of anything with vitamins is a good idea like maybe those single bags of cereal that are nutrient fortified.  Something really useful that would be a great thing that most people never think of would be those little rolls of antacids would be really great to offer. Lots of people have stomach issues/ heart burn and those can be a life saver if someone's got bad heartburn.  I hope some of this info helps_ I'm no expert but I would think any of these things would have been great to have when I was on the streets a few weeks ago and I know if anything happens this is what I'd want_ but I'm just one person so hopefully this is a good base of ideas.   I know most people want to hand out healthy food but honestly I know most people I knew myself included just wanted something tasty and easy to eat. Also caffeine in any capacity is great. I know they're expensive but cliff bars  would be a perfect snack.  Seriously thankyou for being kind enough to try to help people in a way that works for them.

They never chewed holes in the tent_ they would just wait for the door to be open.   Once when my dog was about a year old a mouse had gone into the tent while the dog and I were out for a walk. When we got back my dog was going nuts trying to find it_ he was pawing things_ trying to sniff behind stuff_ but he couldn’t find it and finally tired himself out and gave up. So not long after the dog falls asleep I’m just sitting on my bed on my phone and this tiny little mouse peeks out from behind a crate. He looks at the sleeping dog_ looks at me and then sprints for the open door. Unfortunately the door was one of those ones that are about 8-9 inches up from the floor. Because of the angle of the tent walls he had been able to get **in** the tent_ but now couldn’t get **out.** So very quietly and carefully_ so I wouldn’t wake the dog I started putting stuff in front of the door making a sort of ramp. Thankfully the mouse seemed to understand because as soon as I finished and backed away back to my bed he ran out and scurried up the ramp to freedom and my dog had no idea.,MrsDirtbag,EatMePrincess,89,11,1,3,1530

After looking at it some more (bc of your comment) and specifically researching negative opinions_ it seems that it varies across facilities. California has great resources_ Texas is terrible. No surprises there_ I suppose...  You can try researching the facilities in your state.  What I've heard the most about this program is that they are a good stepping stone if you're putting in the work. So if you are there to learn and apply yourself_ then they will work hard to make things happen for you. This can include a path into community college. However_ apparently they also have people joining who can opt for Job Corps instead of jail. So I wouldn't be surprised if that has an effect on the place_ both in the people you'll be classmates with_ and the structures that exist within the organization. It's not supposed to be a punitive place_ as far as I know_ but if it's used instead of jail_ then I wouldn't be surprised if it is. After all_ the US loves punishing poor people...

In my experience repeated eviction and not signing into a legit lease is usually because of repeated non payment_ taking advantage of the hosts/clashing with them way too much_ poor financial decisions and not keeping a job_ or abusive behavior. I’ve seen it before with someone who myself/a roomie opened up our home to. She abused my roomie and used risk of homelessness as a way to force my roomie to keep her around.  Not wanting to share space doesn’t seem like a likely reason to be kicked out multiple times.   OP they need to first look at shelters nearby and also look on local Facebook marketplace groups for rooms for rent.

iy7231u,I came here to say this.   If you have the money to pay rent upfront for a year you should have enough to pay for an older rv or camper.   Full time lot rent in an an rv park is usually five or six hundred plus electricity.   You would need to buy a heated water hose_ a sewer hose_ and maybe insulation for skirting and a small heater to go under the RV.   You would be better off buying a larger propane tank for winter_ but after that you will be set.   You can skip the skirting if you don’t hook up the water and is the rv park showers and toilets.

Now that I think about it any time I have show up to buy anything from anyone the seller is always uncannily sooooo happy that I followed through 🤣  *edit_ I suppose it CAN be done without scam_ just never give out too much of your info to a posting. I like to say that I live in the area and name a specific thing about the area I’m in that only a REAL seller would know (like a landmark or a street name maybe something about where I used to live if it’s the same town) to let the person know I’m legit… how they act after that let’s me know if they are legit… never cashapp or anything in advance_ I usually offer to meet up in a public place or if it’s their house I take someone with me.,derpqueen9000,Witty_Yesterday_6233,75,2,2,3,1530

People underestimate how big of a barrier  credit screening  is for the poor when it comes to finding somewhere to live...     So every county should have a Continuium of care that offers homeless serviced and is suppose to work with you and help you secure housing. They will even pay for a hotel for you to stay in.

I ask because Phoenix (like most state capitals)_ Prescott_ Flagstaff_ Mesa_ Tucson_ and Nogales have always had significant homeless populations; and don't say it's because of the Hispanics or Native Americans_ because they_ along with other non European and non African origin people's_ only make up 1/3 of the population in Arizona.   African Americans make up the 2nd largest demographic in Arizona.   White people_ in general_ but specifically of Anglo-Germanic origin_ are the majority in Arizona.   The largest homeless demographic in Arizona_ as in all 48 contiguous states_ is Homeless Veterans.   Like me.   I had a plan; unfortunately my plan didn't include the wave of Californians from Silicon Valley sweeping in and buying up all the available properties that the out of state property investment companies hadn't snatched up.

By the way I live in Gilbert we have very little homeless here because first of all we have little public transportation_ the homeless tend to congregate around the light rail area in public transportation. Which is why most people do not want to see a train come through Gilbert.  And yes_ Californians_ and all the transplants that moved here have ruined the housing market. And if you don’t care about anything_ I have to say they just don’t respond. Thanks but there’s a reason why you’re homeless and it’s probably because of something you did or did not do.

iy93qev,You made some bad choices along the way... you expected more from the world than you should have... you work on assumptions more than facts... you didn't change or adapt to your environment fast enough...  ... I'd start with those concepts.  I know you made some bad choices along the way... because I can safely say that almost everyone on the planet has made some bad choices at one time or another in their lives.  Of course... the consequences from those choices will vary greatly... as we are talking globally.  But at least identifying the bad choices and why you made them initially_ can help you from repeating those same mistakes_ when having to make those choices in the future.  I know you expected more from the world than you should have_ because you expected us here to know how you got to where you are_ without knowing at least SOME of the rough details for the landscape.  Going homeless in NYC?  That's one thing and easy to imagine and sympathize with.  Going homeless in Nowhereville_ population 27?  That's another thing entirely and only raises questions... and offers very different obstacles.  What if you have a job_ and you don't do drugs_ and you are about to be homeless because you beat your significant other one too many times... or because you refuse to pay your parent's the money they want for rent... or you've lived with your grandmother for years and she just died and all her stuff went to the state instead of you?  What went wrong.... would be very different in each of those situations.  I know you work on assumptions more than facts.. because you thought the fact that you don't do drugs has some direct connection to how you \***should not**\* be homeless.  That little bit says a LOT about what kind of people you assume make up the homeless community.  It also shows what you assume about the people who make up the **homed** community... like doing drugs makes you homeless.  I know you don't adapt or change to your environment fast enough_ because the likelihood that your impending homelessness happened without some kind of warning or signs is very low.  I acknowledge that this \*can\* happen out of the blue... and people will tell stories about it happening to them that quickly... but many of those stories always leave out a few details that indicate there was time to avoid being homeless.  Again... this doesn't mean it doesn't HAPPEN with no warning.  However... your post here is not a sign of adaptation to your new situation.  Adaptation is moving forward... well... progression.  You are asking about the past... going backward.  Sure... some therapy involves going backwards... but then you are going over the specific details of the past_ and picking them apart painfully.  You aren't doing that here.  So I'd start by looking at these four potential trouble spots.  If you can be honest with yourself_ instead of lashing out in anger_ you may be able to find a few places to make some course corrections and get back on your feet.,bongart,marcusmotors,51,4,1,8,1024

iy2t3fp,I would highly recommend a camo tarp of sorts (not homeless but I like to camp in places I’m not allowed) and neon green and teal do not mix in with the surrounding brush anywhere in the world_ so if you worry about being found and kicked out of where you are I’d recommend a camo tarp to help lengthen your stay at your spot as it would be harder to spot you in day light and even harder to spot you in night,Skeletor_is_god,iamshamtheman,138,23,1,8,1024

We parted ways for a few days and found out the car got towed so we were are gearless and fearless for 4 days in Dec. One night it started snowing and there was a roll of old carpet behind a dumpster.

iy92eam,hey! I currently use a canvas tent with a stove but I'm considering switching back to a two-person tent of which I thrown oversized or California King blanket over the top of it and my body heat is enough to keep it considerably warm even in freezing weather. you should consider that. a two-person tent gives me just enough room for a bag pack myself laying down I'm six foot one_ and my 88 key keyboard which is the same size as me laying down.  if you have a blanket that covers the whole thing and is thick enough or two blankets that cover the whole thing down to the ground you will be shocked as to how much heat your own body can produce in that enclosed insulated space.,Rainbow_Golem,iamshamtheman,138,2,1,8,1024

Taking all of our medicines and just all dying together.

iyebhju,"So you are saying that the life they were experiencing_ \*was actually\* worse than death.  Sure... SOME teenagers have committed suicide because they were abused and lived a life of hell... and SOME teenagers committed suicide because they were bullied... and SOME teenagers committed suicide just because they got rejected.... and SOME teenagers committed suicide because of a combination of things.  Are you saying they were ALL right_ when they thought their problems were worse than death?  Every one of them?  Even before their lives really started... they were right in ending them?  EDIT:  Let's save some back and forth.  No_ they couldn't ALL be right in that their lives were \*actually\* worse than death.  Can you be ABSOLUTELY positive_ that there aren't changes that could be made in a homeless person's life_ that couldn't change their mind on their life being worse than death?  Are you ABSOLUTELY certain that there is NOTHING that could have been done to improve things?  100%?  Because if you aren't ABSOLUTELY 100% positive... then it CANNOT be worse than death.  Because death is 100% final.  There's no... ""Oh Wait... you could have done THIS"" to make things better once that line is crossed.  Here's another way of looking at this.  If there is nothing where you are_ and you are homeless_ and you feel that death is a better option.... you are LITERALLY saying that WALKING is worse than death.... that WALKING to a new place to see if things can be different_ is worse than death.  Or rolling.  Or hobbling.  Or limping.  That doing any of those things is worse than being dead.",bongart,No_Cartoonist3518,30,3,3,8,1024
iygtmcg,Kids and teenagers have big dreams and hopes for the future to become free adults_ they're very curious and hopeful by nature. If a child wants to commit suicide_ then something very serious happened to him or her. Maybe not all teenagers commit suicide for the right reasons_ but most of them do. I wish there was a way to save their lives_ but unfortunately_ the system is too rotten from its foundation to help them. In order to save their lives_ you need more than a parent's hugs and kisses. You need substantial help_ like protecting the child from bullies or help lower the pressure at school etc.  There are two types of homelessness_ there's a temporary homelessness and permanent homelessness. The temporary type is experienced by young and able bodied people who are only experiencing a crisis_ but as long as they're young and can work_ they can lift themselves out of the situation_ But permanent homelessness is a different story. It's usually experienced by physically or mentally disabled people who can't work and don't have family or anyone who can help them_ so there's no much hope for them and there's a great deal of suffering coming their way. If the government can't or doesn't want to help them_ then Why live in the streets in a disabled body or soul for decades until you die if you can end your  In the end of the day_ it's a matter of respect. Only the person who suffers knows how much suffering they can endure and when enough is enough. Why prolong their agony?  Edit: Just to make it clear_ walking is not worse than death_ but lack of freedom_ lack of safety_ starving_ getting robbed_ beaten and raped daily_ with little to no hope in sight_ is worse than death.,Savonarola1452,No_Cartoonist3518,30,0,3,3,1530

iy8k1nk,Yes_ I know how much it is. I live out here. I am lucky I own my home and I bought cheap nine years ago. Otherwise I would be struggling to and probably living with my mom. Since you can’t afford to rent your own place_ a roommate is about the only viable option. Lots of people have to share housing. Your options are to move to a cheaper state but then you’d be leaving your kid or get shared housing or live in your car. You don’t have a lot of options.  Also_ nobody wants homeless in their community. Some are straight out thieves that will steal anything not bolted down. Nobody wants RVs parked in their neighborhood. They don’t live there. So you can’t blame people for not wanting a bunch of homeless in their neighborhood. Many homeless people seem to do very very little to change their situation. There is a way out if you work hard enough. I hope things get better for you. Maybe with a little luck. You’ll find a great roommate in a nice housing situation that works for you.

I can't believe how warm this kept me and it seemed to almost not matter how cold it was outside so long as the insulation was 100% coverage. but take it two person tent something with like a four by seven foot bass or smaller and cover it completely with oversized (120x120) blanket you can also use two queen or king size blankets overlapping so long as the entire top of it is covered entirely and then you can put a tarp on that or you don't really have to if you're like me and you're in the desert.  right now anyway I'm using the canvas tent with the stove and it doesn't keep me as warm as my body heat in a small tent did. of course I can always overload my stove but gathering wood and cleaning the stove stocking it up it all takes effort,Rainbow_Golem,bongart,49,3,1,8,1024

Olive oil is an acid_ so you can use SMALL amounts for your hair and skin as well. SMALL amounts. Also_ i use a terracotta plate as the base for my clay heater. You're gonna have some smoke.    If you find some high heat resistant filter material_ you can place that between the two clay pots. Leave the drain hole open in the inside pot_ and plug the drain hole of the outside pot. The smoke will be forced through the filter material and should mitigate it's affects_ but you still need to keep a source of fresh air available.,Clobhairchaun,bongart,49,1,4,3,1530

That’s a lot of time and effort and unless you are good with sewing it’s as likely as not to just rip anyway.  I really like my method_ the coldest it got down to was 0 when I did it and we were quite comfortable almost too warm at points in that snowy miserable night.

But I do get the vibe that OP should be in a recovery environment instead of fending for themselves with whatever inadequate means are available . It's also true there's hardly any recovery environments when you need them. I'm afraid it's a very common theme and the prognosis is no good at all.

Also the one time a friend let me in my body got way to relaxed after being struggling and fighting to eat_ work survive etc and especially with all the excessive covid restrictions and me being unvaxxed.

ixrtppl,I was staying somewhere temporarily in 2020 and it was a nightmare. The people who lived there didn't clean ONCE in FIVE YEARS! There was a pile of 5 years worth of trash on the front patio and another in the kitchen. I kept paying a cleaning lady to come over_ and my ex who used to be a professional cleaner before I met him and a professional cook helped with the cleanup and did the cooking because there was no way in hell I could cook in there. Btw_ none of the cooking appliances worked_ so he paid for a tabletop stove. It was a nightmare. I was hardly bathing too because I was so disgusted by the nature of the bathrooms. Every time I tried to leave to go back to living in a tent_ the ex would stop me. The leaseholder was a drug addict and would also bring buddies to drink during the fucking pandemic.

Sometimes just shaking off the dull of comfort hell even walking outside when its cold for a bit really helps.

I've learned to just cut back on other things_ cut things completely off that are meaningless to me ( had to be honest with myself a ton it was hard) and just work as much as I can but I used weed as a form of reward and not as a self sabotaging coping mechanism. It's a huge different type of satisfaction when you reward yourself with it rather than go to it when times are hard. Reason why I picked weed because rather than other things like alcohol & cigarettes ( yes I know they are cheaper) but they'll ruin ya health much faster plus it's self sabotaging to get pissed drunk then having to work the next morning.,warhead1233,Liquidmemer,244,2,1,8,1024

ixmnsv9,definitely there would be an interim period where they would face those struggles and i think the comment you made at the top of the post addressed that well.  assuming he enlisted_ he would begin to get paid the day that he got to boot camp biweekly. if he is married and has a child on the way(i’m honestly not sure if they consider that a dependent but i am going to assume they do)_ he would get basic allowance for housing for the price of rent where his wife and dependent are living starting on day one. some of the guys i went through boot camp with who were married made a ridiculous amount of money more than i did; probably 4-5x more.   while in basic training he would have an opportunity to send as much of his money home as he wanted_ up to and including his entire paychecks(which again includes cost of rent in the area his wife is living PLUS his regular salary). he wouldn’t really need that money in training as everything is paid for.   after he got out of training and sent to his duty station_ he would have the option to bring his wife out to him(paid by the government) and either live on base in free housing or live off of base and be paid BAH for his housing(which makes off base housing free in nearly 100% of cases_ most of the time they end up pocketing money after rent).  there still would be that rocky period to begin with which you gave great advice for. i can’t personally say how long it would take to get to boot camp but again in my experience it was never very long. i couldn’t imagine a very eager and motivated person not being able to ship out within at least 2 months_ but again may be wrong…anyways_ to recap_ starting at day one of basic and everyday thereafter they would be taken care of. if the military does one thing good_ it’s taking care of married service members. the quality of life between married and non married is quite disparaging.,treyj88,UncIeRemus,25,3,3,8,1024

Also I know it might sound bad but you might want to consider telling them that you are in fact living in your car at the moment just because they'll put you at higher up on the list to receive vouchers or housing or anything like that and I mean so long as you're not on lease or on a title for a home they can't verify it.

And yes there’s plenty of resources for homeless people or people who are about to be homeless. Search “homeless resources” in your area_ or call social services and they’ll guide you in the right direction.   Motel/hotels have extended stays were you pay $200-300 every one to two weeks_ just have to be careful because your stuff can get stolen if you leave your room unattended (I had stuff stolen staying in a motel before).

Motel room daily pricing changes_ depending on the demand.  With the holiday_ prices go up.    With the weekend_ prices go up.

All of the aches and pains I have now in my 40's_ I get paid for by the VA_ whereas if you stay out there_ you will maybe hope for SSDI or something that won't be enough.  My disability payments could take care of the rent in most places_ meaning that even if I am down bad_ I will be able to keep a roof over my head.  Not to mention the education benefits which if you go to school while you are in the military_ you may be able to transfer benefits to your wife_ and let her build up her career so that when you get out_ she's already established_ and you can build yourself up.   You get out_ and you get a government job_ and boom_ you got a decent retirement_ and a cushy job where as long as you just work average_ you got a decent retirement_ and a ridiculous amount of days off. Unless you got something better_ this is probably one of the most surefire ways to change the trajectory of your life_ and your families for you to become the provider I'm sure you would want to be.  Unfortunately_ the price of being a soldier is that you will have to suffer and miss people. I did 2 deployments_ I know the sting. But the life I can provide for my family now with the doors opened up is better than what I could have done coming from the neighborhood I came from.   &#x200B;  Switching gears.  She's pregnant_ so she needs to look for resources for women.  If you don't have a ring on it_ she should look for single resources as well.  211_ cal fresh_ look into Workforce innovation and Opportunity Act  (WIOA) for training for you and your girl for better jobs. If you need side hustles_ Security Guard companies are always hiring_ and you can work the graveyard shifts to not have to sleep in the cold at night.  Get that money before the kid arrives.  Speaking of which. How far along is this pregnancy?  Shot of honesty here_ neither of you are doing the right thing by bringing a kid in the world you can't take care of.  If Abortion is off the table_ then that above paragraph in reference to the military  is pretty much the blueprint for you to make amends to this kid_ but you and your girl need to be prepared to be uncomfortable because that's the price to pay to get to where you want to be in life.  &#x200B;  If you chose the military route_ you have the time from basic to permanent duty station where you will be apart.  You don't need your paycheck because the military will take care of you_ and if she's connected to resources_ and you are still ""single_ then your paycheck provides extra support to her and your kid until you reunite.

That's where you take your gas can down to the nearest gas station, and you ask people for a single gallon of gas.  When it is full... you put the gas in your tank where it belongs.  This is a time tested method that works.  It is used by Rubber Tramps, Dirty Kids, and Rainbow Family all the time.... almost as much as they will fly signs.  So where you see an end coming... many others see an opportunity to haul the red can down to the station for an afternoon.  >I haven't showered in two weeks  I know the feeling.  I live in the desert, and have to make choices like Do I wash_ or do I save the water to drink and stay alive?""  It won't make you feel better... but I've gone longer.  Currently... I've gone longer.  No chance you could leave the car temporarily to hoof it to the gym_ considering how the lack of shower is weighing on your mind?  Is there any reason why it wouldn't be safe_ unoccupied_ for a few hours?  I assume you are on SNAP food stamps if you are in the USA_ so your food is taken care of.

iyfah5f,I feel you friend. The fear of losing your car_ how cold it got before I learned to insulate my car_ I was a straight zombie during the day because of how I wasn't able to sleep. What you've got going for you is that you've got things organized. That's great for two reasons_ 1- you know where everything is and if you get in a jam_ you can grab the most important things and 2- if it looks neat_ people harass you less. I packed all my bedding and kept it in the trunk_ looked like a regular car with a couple duffle bags in the back seat. Buddy of mine kept his sleeping bag and pillows out. You could see his camp stove and cooler through the window. Guy got harassed all the time! The best way to be left alone is to fly under the radar. Good luck friend_ I hope to see you on the other side of winter_ your car running strong. Lots of love and care!,ladyinatent,johndoe_detroit,37,3,3,3,1530
ixlf8do,When you get a chance_ get a spray bottle to take showers with. It's not as satisfying as a real shower but it's a way to feel clean anyway (and brush your teeth and wash various other things).  And yeah_ I think the wise thing to do is ask people for money. I don't enjoy doing it_ and fortunately haven't had to in a long time_ but it works_ if you keep at it_ and you can at least get a few gallons in your car.  Oddly_ in my personal experience_ losing my car made my life easier. There wasn't this big_ money hungry machine that needs its paperwork and all that crap weighing me down. Once I accepted the fact that a had to pare down to what I could carry in a pack I relaxed somewhat.  What worked for me wouldn't work for everyone though_ so if you feel you need to keep the car (you could sell it after all_ and buy at least a bus ticket_ gear_ things you need for work_ I dunno)_ you can try asking around at businesses for any odd jobs they might let you do. They might look at you like you have three heads_ or they might be rude but there's a good chance to get a little money if you ask around like that and it may help you make connections.  Your post says you want to vent so sorry if that's too much advice. Venting is cool_ but you are a human being in a tough spot_ nothing more_ nothing less. You have options. There are good times and good people out there even though sometimes it seems cruel to be hopeful.

I remember my first time and how impossible it felt_ it ain't so bad. Honestly everyone should have to experience it_ the world would be a lot better place. Old cardboard walk of shame.   I ain't got no shame about it_ what's shameful is being a coward_ and too cowardly and proud to do what's necessary to stay healthy and alive_ or killing yourself_ or wallowing in self pity. What's shameful is that we're letting people starve and freeze when there's so much waste and extra and it takes no effort for the rich to swipe their card and feed someone_ or give them a couple of gallons of gas to keep their home.   It is where God put you_ learn from it. God gave everyone what they have_ and some times the gambling man is rich and the working man is poor. The only thing that makes one human better than the other is their deeds_ their faith_ their character. Whatever we got_ it's our test. This is yours_ so pull your boots up cause harder working and better men have been reduced to less_ and it's all hopeless anyways cause death is coming for everyone whether they're rich or poor. You can place your hope in what is decaying before your eyes_ or you can place your hope in God_ and that He will forgive the worst of your sins_ and you will be spared the true suffering_ the suffering of Hell.,Decent_Froyo_5530,johndoe_detroit,37,11,1,3,1530

ixhb5g4,All homeless aren't drug users or alcoholics. Judge each case separately because a good portion are.cash will help the most but pretty much anything will help offer food_ water_ in your case it's cold so maybe a coffee_ hot chocolate_ hot sandwich. I've only been homeless about a month now and its crazy how I'm viewed. Never done a hard drug in my life nor do I drink. I'm just trying to take care of my dog and get off the streets.,quietstorm1234,katexd52,25,10,1,3,1530
ixjsymy,honestly my answer is to ask! you never know what a person may need_ its impossible to anticipate every individuals needs and its also unlikely to find a universally helpful thing (other than water and good socks 😁) so if you have the time i would suggest asking those you see frequently!,rotlog,katexd52,25,3,1,8,1024
ixikv80,Why not donate to a shelter or a food pantry? Volunteer? Not every homeless person uses drugs or drinks_ but you can’t tell in most cases and you don’t want to be an enabler.

ixhc72j,Have you done a little looking around at existing aid organizations in your area? It might help to start with a call there to see what gaps need filling and possibly just get some good information from those already doing assistance work.   As for providing immediate help to people you meet I’ve found what is really helpful is to be prepared. I hate coming across someone in need and fumbling for money_ a bottle of water etc. I live in an area that is very cold in the winter (adjust this based on season) and keep a large Ziploc bag in my car with some:  Hot Hands and Hot Feet_ snacks (granola bars_ nuts_ dried fruit_ jerky)_ hygiene wipes_ pads/tampons_ a Dunkin’ Donuts gift card_ wool socks_ a mini flashlight_ a small plastic poncho_ an emergency Mylar blanket_ and a mini first aid kit.  This might not be possible if you walk or take public transit_ and the needs of your community may be different. I’m not sure that anyone knows what would be most beneficial more than the people currently living unsheltered. It might help to ask? See what would be of use?   I’d like to think the concern that the money may be used for drugs comes from a place of not wanting to contribute to further harm_ but it is reductive_ judgmental_ and unfair. I know many people struggling with homelessness do have untreated substance use disorder_ and that’s a public and private health crisis_ but I’d hate to see that used as a reason to ignore the needs of our neighbors.  Good luck!,porcupinesandpurls,katexd52,25,3,1,8,1024

iy20n2q,Was thinking similarly myself.  The top replies hit this one on the head_ ASK what is needed_ then return with what you can get.   Personally_ yeah I like coffee_ but certainly do not need expensive Starbucks.  Just plain black_ easier on the stomach the better.  Honestly_ I’d drink hot water and put the money elsewhere personally.  Not completely against gift cards…they’re just severely limiting and as pointed out_ not always a sensible choice to purchase goods and services with.  Best to Ask what is needed first_ could be socks_ gloves_ etc. You just won’t know_ unless you have that conversation.

Be ready to be out of the car before people are going out to their own in the morning_ anyone parked near you may report you and it's unlikely management there will be okay with the situation. Stay organized and neat_ a messy car means bugs or rodents_ and if you're lucky enough to avoid those it gets stressful. Arrange your clothes by what you want to wear_ plan out as many outfits as you can and keep them together. Get a sun shade_ it's normal to leave in a car window all the time and is great for privacy. If you can put one in the back too. It's getting colder so layers are super important. A sleeping bag is the best_ my sleeping pad is what truly makes my jeep comfortable. You want a layer below you as well as above. Fuzzy socks are life_ and I actually use my old COVID masks to cover my eyes and nose while sleeping. My nose is always cold and it's the best thing I've found to help. The library is amazing and totally free_ sometimes they have rooms you can book for privacy for things like zoom calls. If you don't have a card find an old bill and your id and get one. I love coffee and spend a couple mornings a week at starbucks_ free wifi and always tons of outlets. Planet fitness is great for showers_ if you're there during slow times it'd be easy to charge your things in the changing room.

ix72hhd,GIS is like Google maps_ except it's with local property. Just internet search: Maken County GIS  Or: Metropolis City GIS  But GIS is useless without knowing what to look for.   There's normally a publicly available list of people and businesses who are behind on their property taxes because the government always wants their money. Many of these properties are abandoned and landlocked. I'm talking about raw land because you're not gonna find many abandoned houses.   If I find a property that 30+ years behind on their property taxes_ then that's a good prospect. Also look for property owned by dead people.  Or you can just search the GIS map for property you already know is empty but you need to get the ownership information for it. Like something you drive by everyday but never really paid close attention to.   Also look for landlocked properties. These properties are abandoned because they have no legal easement (driveway connecting to the road) but... if there's no connection to the road_ then nobody can see it from the road. 💡  Then the lowest hanging fruit is county/city delinquent tax foreclosure auctions. Here you're more like to find empty houses but it's not safe because it's easy for others to find the auction listing. Lots of people will come around to view the property before bidding at the auction.  Although_ sometimes the tax foreclosure auctions will list junk property that absolutely no one is interested in. Like irregularly shaped or sized properties.,Oviris,Rabiddd,152,15,2,3,1530

ix19q7k,I got you Piano Man!  Denver_ CO Ways to help homeless people shivering in the Colorado cold creator avatar David Heitz 3 hours ago https://img.particlenews.com/image.php?url=2aFZpd_0jH3FHWJ00 Islandworks/Pixabay By David Heitz / NewsBreak Denver  (Denver_ Colo.) So maybe you’ve seen a homeless person shivering on the street_ their breath visible it’s so cold. And at that point in time_ maybe you decided you want to help.  Here’s a listing of ways you can help people experiencing homelessness during the winter. These ideas came from people who work with those experiencing homelessness_ including Ayla Ray Leonard and Kevin Raleigh of Colorado Coalition for the Homeless_ and Trevor Baringer of Denver Rescue Mission.  · Buy someone a cup of coffee so they have an excuse to hang out in a coffee shop for a few hours and warm up. You can buy $5 McDonald’s gift cards to hand out if you’re able.  · Distribute hand warmers and socks. These inexpensive items can be lifesavers for people experiencing homelessness. Socks get wet when you’re homeless. Chronically wet feet deteriorate.  · If you own a business_ allow people to come inside for a while and warm up.  · Offer to walk with or drive someone to a shelter or to the library. “If you’re prepared to engage with people at that level_ people will appreciate it_” Leonard said. Baringer agreed_ adding “nothing is wasted” on efforts to help people experiencing homelessness. “It truly is going saving someone’s life.”  · Hand out bus passes. Some people have a place where they can stay in cold weather_ such as a relative’s or friend’s house_ but have no way to get there.  · A complete listing from Colorado Coalition for the Homeless of ways to help unhoused people during winter can be found here.  Homeless advocacy group demands more  Housekeys Action Network Denver_ a homeless advocacy group_ issued a press release Friday asking for donations of tents and sleeping bags. Donations can be made to Mutual Aid Monday.  During the Safety_ Education_ Housing and Homelessness Committee Wednesday_ city staff downplayed stories of homeless people being turned away from shelters. According to HAND_ the reaction underscored “the complete dismissal of what houseless people themselves are telling them is happening_” the news release stated. “Many of these incidents were reported and witnessed directly by advocates and the City's own outreach partners and still this reality is denied.”  According to the HAND news release_ “This committee meeting made it ever more clear that City and community action is needed to try and stop people from suffering and dying this winter. Already this winter it is our understanding at least two people have died on the streets due to exposure to the cold. This cannot be a standard we accept.”,Givemeallyourtacos,Great_Profit_9770,27,10,1,11,964

ix2l0sa,I have been volunteering for almost two years..it has been interesting to say the least. Many homeless folks that I referrred to as not being very intelligent_ simply do not think long term. In many cases_ yes_ irresponsible. I do see these folks on occasion playing lotto...stupid. And some_ quite simply_ are simply not smart enough to do_ or keep a job that pays anything...this is not meant to be a knock on them..I am not smart enough to be a Dr for instance.  And some folks cannot comprehend what it takes to reliably put cans on the shelf at Dollar General_ or whatever. These are not bad people_ just not very bright_ and have no one to help them.,Texan2116,Great_Profit_9770,85,2,3,11,964
ix3w743,"Hmm.  So... ""a lot"" of homeless aren't intelligent_ eh?  And now the people who work at places like Dollar General aren't very intelligent either.  This list just gets longer over time_ doesn't it?  And not thinking long term is a sign of not being very intelligent?  That's odd.  You have to LEARN how to think long term... you have to LEARN the difference between dreaming and planning.  This is not something that people are born with like a genetic memory.  Chess is a game of thinking and planning moves ahead of your opponent.  Not every INTELLIGENT person can play chess_ or even provide a competent game.  A lack of ability to play chess well_ is not a sign of a lack of intelligence.  It is a sign that a person lacks SPECIFIC knowledge.  I'm getting the impression you equate intelligence_ with what knowledge one has... that if one doesn't KNOW something_ this automatically means you classify them into the ""stupid"" category.  I mean... here you are_ saying that people who never learned how to plan ahead properly are not very intelligent... when it is simply a lack of knowing HOW to plan ahead properly.  Homeless people playing the lottery are stupid?  Is that because **everyone** who plays the lottery is stupid_ or is it only stupid when homeless people play?  >These are not bad people_ just not very bright_ and have no one to help them.  Who said they were bad people?  Not me.  But saying ""these are not bad people"" does **not** give validity to your assertion that they aren't very intelligent... like you thought it would.  You look down on others_ and you justify it by lying to yourself about your own benevolence.  You don't acknowledge when you have been wrong.  You are definitely part of the problem.  You've pre-judged all these people you could never possibly know_ and you do it with the most specious logic.

But today_ it's different_ like these buildings have an office of social workers inside the complex that is open 24/7.   The staff there makes sure_ everybody is well and alive. They help with the paperwork_ get the homeless places for therapy and recovery_ for detox and rehab. They make welfare checks and make sure_ nobody is a hoarder etc.  With this close monitoring and help all the time_ it's much easier for the people to get off the street and stay off the street in long term.,Diacetyl-Morphin,Great_Profit_9770,85,3,4,6,521

iwy7vaq,The times I've tried the shelter was always some nonsense they had a six or 7:00 p.m. curfew_ you couldn't bring too many items in my case all I had was a backpack with an extra pair of jeans and three underwears in it_ theft was rampant_ or other homeless folks will try to bully you_ security was non-existent in certain places.   If you had a car and they found out about it they would give you a hard time.   There are some shelters where the staff abused the hell out of you I was at one place briefly where the females got to go to rooms where they had cots and stuff but I suspected that they were being abused_ and the males were forced to sleep on basically a glorified basement floor with rats scurrying around.   The shelter system is a joke if whoever funds them doesn't actually monitor what these not for profits do with the money. I remember one Thanksgiving Day they were trying to serve us turkeys and the food was spoiled like the taste and  everything was spoiled and anybody who said anything was basically threatened with eviction or ejection.   Another shelter I was at this time I was working as a janitor there and still l living in my car that had supervisor basically expected some sort of bribe in order for them to do anything for you I mean he didn't outright say it but you can tell.    One shelter I stayed at they wanted us to put our backpacks in a secure room some people cooperated and then the next morning they're throwing our backpacks in the dumpster and threatening us with police if we went and got our backpacks.

The many times I've been homeless I've also had jobs (sometimes multiple) and the curfews/line-ups/bed vouchers were too much to deal with when all I wanted was a place to sleep between shifts. Or somewhere to relax on days off so I wasn't just spending all day in a library or meandering a mall. Much easier to find a park and string up a hammock or in winter buy a tent_ sleeping bag_ and portable battery heater.
