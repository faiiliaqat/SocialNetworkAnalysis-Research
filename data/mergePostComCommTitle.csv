10y27vy,"Spent first night unprepared for cold thunderstorm Yesterday, the guy who works at the storage unit that I would keep all my things, sleep, and read; decided to lock me out completely without even telling me. My lock was cut off and a red one was placed. I had access to nothing last night. All my toiletries, sleeping bag, water, clothes, etc. all basically taken from me. I was so pissed. I know it wasn’t legal but the guy himself said he was gonna turn a blind eye and if I get caught by his other coworkers then it is what it is. Yet he kept going out of his way making random comments and issues and then suddenly locked me out completely. I wasn’t dressed correctly for the weather last night as I had an interview that morning then was at the library. When I came back and saw what happened I had no way to change into anything thicker nor knew a place to go as I’m new to this city. I’m just soo frustrated especially cause I got the unit only 10 days ago and never bothered a soul. I just sat quietly and no one ever knew I was there besides this one worker. I don’t know what the sudden issue was as he got aggressive with me the day before this happened by opening the storage door while I was sleep and simply shaking his head and saying yep this isn’t gonna work for me. There aren’t really any homeless shelters, a few of them tend to certain demographics of homeless or is a first come first serve basic with a limited amount of beds. So I was unable to travel to these or I simply missed the time slot. I have no clue what I’m gonna do now as I can’t afford basics as I only have like $20 left I believe. Last night was so cold and windy I could barely walk to my interview cause my legs were so damn numb.",negamoonspoon,17,1,3,1530

10xv1r7,"After being homeless for over a year, I have a place to live. I got a bed in a sort of assisted living facility for people with mental health diagnoses. It's located in an apartment complex; I'm in a two-bedroom with three other people. I moved in Monday. Well, so far I brought a duffle bag full of clothes and my toiletries. I'll be bringing the rest of my stuff here over the course of the next week. 

I lived in my car for the first six months or so, but circumstances made that no longer a viable option. I was in an accident (my fault) and totaled one car. I got another with the money from my insurance, then totaled that one six weeks later. The second accident wasn't my fault; a car in the oncoming lane slammed on it's brakes, and the car that was tailgating it swerved into my lane.

I swerved to avoid it and hit a utility pole. The other two cars went on their way, so I was left with no witnesses. I knew if I reported it to my insurance, my payments would skyrocket, and I was already struggling to pay them. It was painful, but I had to junk it and work out a new plan. 

I was fortunate to have someone who was willing to let me set up camp in his garage. There was a gas station two blocks away with a bathroom, and there are two places in my city where homeless folks can shower. I have food stamps, and I mostly lived on canned foods (usually eaten cold from the can) and microwavable stuff from the gas station. I had electricity, but no heat. 

Being in an apartment is weird. The other people in the apartment seem cool, and my roommate has pretty much the same diagnoses I do, so we get along great. But being in a warm environment is proving more difficult to adjust to than I expected; if I sit still for more than fifteen minutes, I fall asleep. I've missed two medical appointments so far because I dozed off. I think I also had a sleep deficit; I slept a lot when I was in the garage, but it wasn't what you'd call quality sleep.",Rachel_Silver,105,2,3,1530

10xl0zt,"I need someone to talk to. I made a post about this the other day on an alt but deleted it out of anxiety. Anyways, I fucked up my life. I had it all and became complacent. I lost everything. I burned bridges. I fucked up. I'm about to be homeless. I have a plan, but I'm not sure if I should do it. I don't know if I'm about to make the best decision of my life or the worst. I'm currently in the process of trying to join the army so that Im not homeless, but it isn't going smoothly. My recruiters sent me to MEPS even though we all knew that I would fail the bodyfat requirements, but none of us knew that MEPS wouldn't let me come back until June. I lost the weight really fast, so now I'm able to join, but MEPS has a rule where you have to lose 1% of bodyfat every month or something like that. Since I lost the weight in only a month, I still have to wait until June to be eligible to go back to MEPS. So now I have to survive until I can finally go back. I can't be too upset at myself. I made bad decisions. It's all my fault. And honestly, I deserve this. I'm going to endure this. Idc what it takes. But I'm scared. I'm not the type of person to be on the streets. I can already see my future where my backpack and duffel bag get mugged from me and I'm left with nothing. I can probably do this, but I'm terrified. I've cried so much that I feel dehydrated. Tomorrow my friends are gonna pick me up. I'm gonna go with them to help them clean a couple of cabins and then I'll stay the night with them. Hopefully I'll find someone to talk to on here that can give me advice. I'm in a state that made it a felony to camp on public property, so I think it's best if I go somewhere else. Not to mention it still gets too cold here at night, so I need to go somewhere warmer. I think I'm gonna hitchhike. I trimmed up my beard and packed most of my stuff already. I have a nice looking jacket to wear as well as pants and a belt, so hopefully i look presentable enough to actually get picked up. I think I'm mostly scared of getting harassed by police. I'm terrified more of going to jail than I am of being homeless. If I could get to somewhere warm where I can get food from a homeless kitchen and just spend my days preparing for when I can join the army, then I don't think this would be so bad. But I just know it'll be the opposite. Sorry, this turned into more of a rant about my situation than anything constructive, but I really feel like I needed to post this. I got to eat one last good meal with the people I'm currently staying with. When we left we stopped at a light where there was a homeless veteran holding a sign. I gave him a $5 bill. I really should've kept it considering I'm about to be in the same situation as him, but I almost felt obligated to. I thought maybe it would give me some good karma. Even when I do good things I'm only thinking about myself. Everything sucks.",cantthinkofnameahhh,11,2,3,1530
10xkh9c,Anxiety about being homeless again I've been homeless off and on since I was 17. The most I've gone without being homeless was for 18 years when my late husband saved me from the streets. He died coming up on 6 years ago and I became homeless again when I lost our house after he died. I got a place off and on renting rooms for the last few years. Homeless in between renting rooms. My anxiety about becoming homeless again has gotten so bad that I've started ordering things online that will help when I become homeless again. I just needed to get that out.

10xd8rk,"Working with no place to stay Hello, I'm 19, and I have no place to stay. I currently reside at my mother's house, but I want to leave because she and I argue too often, and she's often telling me things in a subtle way to indicate that she wants me out. She also complains about how I'm not on the lease and I need to leave. 

I stayed with my relatives from June to December of last year when I first moved out. I left after I had graduated high school. They practically kicked me out because of their own selfish reasons, because I did what I was told and helped whenever they asked. I also have no friends, so the asking to coach surf at a friend's house option is out of the question.

I applied for Job corps, (for those who don't know, it's a government funded program to give education to the less financially fortunate.) but it has been over 3 months since I applied and I hadn't heard a thing from them. Now, I'm having second thoughts about going. 

My mother told me that I have until March to leave. I was looking into shelters, called, and was practically turned down. The lady recommended me to go to job corps, already trying to get in, and she told me to join the service. I do not feel comfortable doing anything related to the military, whether I'm actively working with it, or just being on the sidelines. My career path doesn't align with it either. 

So my question, is if any of you have any options to what I should do? I want to work. Like, seriously. I feel depressed having to go to job corps. It was my decision, but my mom is just doing it as a way to get rid of me because she doesn't want to deal with me. She makes it seem as though it's for my best interest but it isn't LOL what I want to do, I have to go to college for. I live in Maryland, living closest to the following cities: Nottingham, White Marsh, Towson, Middle River, Baltimore, and Catonsville. Please give me any suggestions.

10wd36l,"Think Before Running Away I want to preface this with a disclaimer. I don't want your pity, I hate pity because it feels so fake. I also am not posting this for some guilt tripping into getting money, if you offer me money in any way I'll tell you flat out no. I'm posting it here soley for the fact people won't do that.


So I 'ran away' from home when I was 18. I had been planning this specific escape since I was 17 but I had been trying to run from home since I became conscious of the abuse happening to me. That was back in middle school so I'd say my planning spanded four years. Technically three years because my first attempt at 16 failed and I was locked up in a dog kennel in my family's basement for the later end of sophomore year.

When I ran away at 18 I had planned it so I would wait till after the graduation party, I was sheltered but I had gone to one graduation party before and my older brother had graduated so I heard you get money when you graduate. I wasnt allowed a job my mother wasnt managing so storing money was very hard. I also had saved the links to all the homeless resources I could find into the notes of my phone. I remember packing the day I left and just. I was SO scared, I knew then and I still know now that if I went back home I would be put in the basement and this time I wouldn't get to see the sun again.


I drove away going to my friend's house and my parents flipped their shit, I was forced to return my car I was fully prepared to take over the responsibility of paying for insurance of my and had the money ready but no good. My father threatened my life and calling the cops if I didn't bring it back and I brought it back due to be so scared. 


That's when I saw a glimpse of how shitty it is to be homeless, I walked everywhere and if you live in America you'd understand how unwalkable it is. I got a job but the walk to work was three miles with steep hills and it was mid summer. I ended up quiting after going to a mental hospital. I went because I was walking home and collapsed due to heat stroke and just laid in a heap of limbs and a bike on top of me, cars passed by and no one stopped. I came too after who knows how long and was still way to hot. My body was fighting me but I got me and the bike home.



I went in and out of psychotic episodes, I went to the mental hospital again after a miscarriage and that's when things got a bit better! I stared doing better cause I got better job at a cleaning company.

I didn't have much money anymore, I had 1,100 when I left but sprinkled through my journey I'd run into my parents and they'd make a huge scene.


So fucuding  to just a little over three ago when I got that cleaning job I was living out of my car and eventually stated renting out the basement. I was finally living the life I dreamed of having excuse a few hiccups here and there. 

Then I relapsed on alcohol. Let me tell you that being homeless means that at some point some drug is gonna show up and you're gonna have to decide for yourself what you do. I was stressed because my boss was being strangely framilar with me and getting upset when I didn't want to spend time with her, this triggered some flash backs to some cases of attempted sx trafficking I went through and I was not handling it well.  I drank two cans of some alcohol my friend gave me (big mistake because I didn't check the percentages).

I can't remember that night well but this is the basics, I couldn't get inside to my apartment because they (my landlords) locked the one door I didn't have a key too so I went back to my car and continued drinking. next think I know I'm waking up to the feeling of choking and my seat belt is hnging me. I unbuckled it fell against the right side of my car and passed out again. Woke up and this time I vaguely realized my car was crashed because the front windshield looked cracked to me I touched it and cut up my hand and I guess that was enough for me to get to work. I wasn't found by the rescue team until around 2-3 hours later and I a mix of hypothermia and Shock were shutting down my organs. 


Obviously I lived, but I lost everything in that crash including my job, appartment, and my birth certificate, ss, and important court documents. 


It took me until today to finally be able to get a hold of the impound lot, turns out I need to pay a shit ton of money to get my stuff out of my car. Money I do not have any can not get because I have no job. Further more I have taxes I'm getting help figuring out and if I owe money I'm fucked because I do not have the money for this.

10w9007,"Duffel/tent suggestions, general suggestions Hello people.

I am about to be homeless at the end of March. I had planned on living in the car, but thieves stole the catalytic converter, title, and registration. The title and registration were out-of-state and I'm not even sure I can get the dups in time, and if I can, I have a 2K+ repair job I can't afford (aftermarket is illegal here, so it's full price or nothing at all).

Anyway, that's just the woe-is-me part. I guess I need a decent tent and duffel. I'm looking for temporary housing and I may get some through the state (I am on state insurance and get help and therapy already, so they have set me up with a housing manager), but the case manager says all shelters/temporary living are full and on wait status, and that I have a better chance to get it once I am actually homeless, which I guess means I will end up hoofing it. Hence the need for a decent duffel I can put a tent in and still have some room for clothes and whatever else. Recommendations?

I don't know what I'm doing. I have never been homeless. Prior to trauma that lit up existing mental health issues a few years ago, I was a public high school teacher. Now I can't hold onto a job. I am on medication and getting better, but it feels like a slow road. Too slow for me to maintain housing, at any rate.

Thank you for any ideas.

Edit: Thank you. I am in southern California. Orange County. I have access to a phone for the time being. I'm not sure of budget...some friends raised a few hundred for car repairs but the repairs are still out of reach, so I guess I have a little. Maybe $200?",JayStrat,13,1,3,1530

My family has been looking at large tracts of land to homestead, build some yurts and cabins for renting, possibly put in some hook ups for RVs to camp, etc. We have been thinking about how to add a component that could be beneficial to the homeless and transient community. We have a couple of  ideas that I would like to hear your thoughts on. 

1. Build a small, bare bones cabin near the edge of our property that is unlocked and available to those passing through without the need to ask us. We would have signs posted about private property, but as long as things are taken care of, it is free to use for a few days, as needed.

2. Have one of our yurts or cabins available free of charge, as needed, with a reservation required, and a time limit of a few days agreed upon. 

We would be glad to hear the pros and cons. We are trying to balance safety of all parties, practical logistics, and preserving the dignity of everyone involved. I know there are many things we are not thinking of that need to be taken into consideration. Is this even a realistic situation? Do you have other ideas that we haven't thought of?

10vusru,"Am I the only one with ""food fantasies""? Yeah, maybe a wierd question but being dirt-poor or homeless can do that to you.

In my case and due to my specific situation/circumstances, I have been living off of the cheapest of TV dinners for years. One meal per day. Some days, it's just one meal consisting of a generic can of pork and beans and some fruit.

I don't even remember what a home-cooked meal tastes like anymore. Like meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans. Maybe a piece of cake or pie for dessert.

I find myself frequently fantasizing about cheeseburgers, fries, milk shakes, fish and chips, roast beef sandwitches, pizza, subs, tacos and that sort of thing. My mouth waters for awhile and then I try to put it out of my mind.

Not saying that being homeless is some type of paradise (it's NOT) but at least I could go into 99% of restaurants and bum a meal and multiple times a day if I wanted to. Being stuck in a run-down old shack with little money and no car may sound better that being homeless (and maybe it is in many ways) but living on a meager diet of cheap food every day for years is no picnic either.

They were supposed to come with me and us all rent a place together. We finally find the one place in all the city that allows smoking on our balcony. Spent 6 weeks living in my car to get financially approved for the apartment and my friends drop out and in desperation I signed whatever paperwork I could to secure this place and get out of my car.


 It's completely unsustainable now. I'm behind 3 to 4 months on all of my bills. Rent is 2k I'm shelling it all out on my own because my roommate is disabled and unable to find work. Also a dear friend of mine that I've known for years. He helps around the house but other than that financially he gets about 380 in stamps every month. I work anywhere from 8 to 16 hours a day nearly every day at two jobs and I'm just burnt out. 


I unfortunately cannot find a roommate. Because I do not have another room to offer them to sleep in. No one trustworthy wants to hold up to basic living standards to get along in a roommate situation. I've vented on here multiple times and it's like people don't want a place to sleep from the cold. 


No matter how many times I look or vent. How many hours i work. How much debt i put myself in for loans. No one seems to want to just be a decent human being and contribute to a household and become friends. Where i don't have to be the only one working and can have time to rest and get to know each other. Share common interests become a tribe. I'm like 2 days away from needing rent and I'm more than 1400 behind with no hope left.

Land Buddy is an off-grid platform that gives you news, ads, and offers from people who live off the grid to join their off-grid communities or villages. These communities or villages have beautiful tiny houses or apartments, and instead of paying rent, you work the land or learn artisan crafts. It's kind of like a medieval society in today's world.

The idea that modern serfdom might one day be the solution to housing-related poverty fascinates me. Students who typically have low incomes would be able to attend school without having to pay rent and would learn a skill that could help them earn money. Families are welcome in these off-grid communities, which can be found worldwide.

I've always been drawn to societies of the future. When you think of serfdom, you probably picture someone in a medieval society who was forced to work the land and didn't have much freedom. However, in today's society, modern serfdom doesn't take away any rights, and you can take advantage of all the perks of the modern world.

Although this is not the case, when people think of Off the Grid, they typically envision living in the middle of nowhere without access to the internet or utilities. Solar panels or generators power the majority of grid-connected homes, and utilities are either partially on the grid or powered by an Off-Grid source.

I believe that happiness is greater in a community where people share interests than in a city where no one knows anyone. Because everyone must constantly see each other and get along, inequality is lower when the population stays small. My personal opinion is that the society we live in, which is dominated by large cities or towns, contributes to poverty and this opinion of mine is also a fact.

In this new society model we have a society with sufficient food, freshwater, and housing for all if the majority of people grew their own food and engaged in a variety of trades, as well as better health as a result of less junk food consumption and healthier lifestyles as a result of physical labor. This kind of society would also be best for families who are currently homeless or poor, but in reality, it would be great for people of all social classes.

Although it is true that this concept could result in a dystopia in which we live in districts similar to those in The Hunger Games, there are probably those who disagree with it and claim that it will not result in a dystopia so long as it is implemented. Additionally, millions of people worldwide and President Biden and Ted Talks support this concept, which is why I am confident that this society will become a reality. Last but not least, People will be forced to conform if costs of living continue to rise and quality of life continues to decline.

10tp2ss,"I feel we should rename ""Family"" Shelters, to ""Everyone-is-welcome,-except-for-single-men"" Shelters. This would be a lot more accurate a name.

Family shelters accept women and children. Including single women.

LITERALLY the ONLY type of people they don't accept are single men. They accept literally all other parts of society, boys, girls, women, and every other type of human on earth, except for single adult men.

So they should just be honest and just call it what it is. A ""Eveyone-is-welcome-except-for-single-men Shelter.""

This way, when some men end up committing horrible desperate acts of survival, people will stop asking why it's mostly men doing these things, and will understand these are a DIRECT result of discrimination. Maybe it's because they're excluded from the last safety net of survival? Nothing tells a person ""society does not care about you"" like denying them access to a decent shelter just because of how they were born.

The emotional damage that results from experiencing this type of discrimination is absolutely irrepairable. This injustice in their most critical time of need... being told that they are subhuman, and not worthy of survival, that stays with them forever. If that man had any drop of love or empathy for humanity left in him, you can be guaranteed that after experiencing this, it is now gone. Gone forever. This is how monsters are created.

It's 2023. No other part of life or society is GENDER-SEGREGATED anymore. So why do homeless shelters need to be? Why divide and torment people like that? Like they're some kind of farm cattle?

If some men are dangerous criminals, then throw these men in prison. But the overwhelming majority of single men are NOT dangerous criminals. And we should NOT treat them like dangerous criminals. It DEHUMANIZES them. It breeds resentment and contempt for their neighbors, their community, and the world.

\*update: I find it interesting that while the overwhelming majority of redditors in here upvoted this post and AGREE that this discrimination is wrong, most of the actual replies are trying to excuse this type of discrimination.

10tcio9,"3 months in my car. I can't believe I'm here. It's hard to believe that just a few short months ago, I had a job, a place to live, and stability. But life has a funny way of throwing curveballs, and I was hit with a few too many. I lost my job, my landlord raised the rent, and I couldn't seem to catch a break in finding a new job that paid enough to cover my bills. So, I made the heart-wrenching decision to move into my car. At first, it was supposed to be temporary, but as time went on, I realized I was in it for the long haul. Despite the struggles and the feeling of hopelessness that often creeps in, I try to focus on the positives and find small ways to make life bearable. It hasn't been easy, but I'm a survivor and I'll find a way to make it through.

Living in my car and facing the threat of homelessness has been one of the most difficult and emotional experiences of my life. Every day is a struggle, filled with feelings of fear, embarrassment, and uncertainty.

One of the biggest fears I face is the constant worry of being discovered and losing my car, which is also my home. Every night, I struggle to find a safe place to park where I won't be bothered or asked to move along. I often go without a good night's sleep because I'm always worried about being caught.

It's also a challenge to maintain my daily routine and keep up with personal hygiene while living in my car. It's not easy to find a private place to take a shower or use the restroom, and I often feel embarrassed when I have to go to a public place to do so.

The hardest part of all, however, has been trying to find a job. It's a catch-22 situation: I need a job to afford a place to live, but I don't have a stable address or phone number, which makes it difficult for potential employers to contact me. I feel discouraged and hopeless at times, like I'll never be able to escape this situation.

Despite these difficulties, I've tried to stay positive and keep searching for a way out of this situation. Recently I discovered survey apps, which have been a lifesaver for me. I can take surveys on my phone at any time, anywhere, and earn a little extra money. It may not seem like much, but it's made a huge difference for me. I can now afford small luxuries like a hot meal or a cheap gym membership, and I feel more in control of my situation. I found the app on tiktok and have used to it to pay for just about every meal since finding it. It's not much but it's something.

You find yourself homeless. Maybe you have been homeless for awhile. Then, one day you are able to get up enough money for some gear and hit the trail.

She didn't tie her bag of linens the morning before  and had not bagged her linen on a few occasions before.  it is 15 degrees below zero right now!!! 

There are dozens of examples of this kind of meaningless enforcement of rules with harsh consequences but this one was so insane I felt that people needed to at least be given the chance to know this is happening. I was kicked out twice, for leaving the shelter 5 minutes late and denied access for arriving 45 minutes late. I am a reasonable person, and understand the need to enforce a curfew/latest entry time which is held strictly, 10pm, which is fairly liberal so I don't contest that one bit... But the morning I had left late, was because I had dropped my medication which I had just restarted and had the  copay specially covered because I was unable to afford in any way. I knew I needed to find it or it would be thrown away rather than set aside for me when I came in that night. Or pocketed by someone who saw profit potential in a bottle of medication.

I am also under the impression that in order to stay in a shelter, you need to provide ID for whatever state you are seeking shelter in as well as undergo a background check. Same thing with food/clothing banks or other, similar services including public clinics.

So, in other words, lots of paperwork, proof of everything, a background check, ID for the state you are seeking services in and in order to get stamps, cash assistance, perm housing, etc, you need to prove that you have lived in that state for at least a year.

I guess the solution is to just hang out on the streets in some sketchy part of town (hoping you live through it) until your ""one year"" is up and then start looking for assistance?.

10plpdt,"Not homeless but feel like I am…long read! My husband and I never had any money. We still don’t. But we finally were able to save the money I had in my retirement account to purchase a house of our own. We have had to rent for our entire marriage (12 years) and we have been bounced around due to landlords wanting to sell the house, raising the rent, etc. We do live in a very HCOL area, but all of our family is here and we have small kids so we wanted to keep them altogether. Due to the fact that we couldn’t afford to “buy” a house in the area, we ended up buying one down south for way less money. We moved there and lasted a year, before I convinced my husband to sell it. Since we had no equity in it, we didn’t make any profit off of the sale and just paid back what we owed the bank. We had no money going into this, but due to extreme circumstances- we had to get out of there (my handicapped son and I got held up at gunpoint outside of his school there). I was traumatized from this event and said I need to go home to my family where it is safe. 

We left with no $ and no place to live. My husbands parents allowed us to stay with them, but told us it had to be short-lived and just long enough for us to save enough $ to find housing of our own. We have now been here for 6 months. By this time, you would think that we would have saved a large amount of $. But no. When I got here, my husband stated quite clearly that we cannot afford to live back here and that I need to look for jobs elsewhere. Well I found a job here and started it. I figured I might as well start working and saving as much $ as I possibly can. Then Christmas hit, and all of the $ I was making went all to the kids Christmas gifts. Starting in January, I changed my banking elections for my paycheck and started putting my paycheck into a separate account so that I can save SOMETHING. During all of this, I found out that my husband has been paying for his parents bills and expenses, and I was told that we would just be paying for their groceries. I told my husband that he should be paying his way and offering a small amount of rent per month but he said that he is taking care of “enough”. Yeah, I am sure you are! 6 months in and we haven’t saved a dime. 

When I discuss this with my husband, he tells me that he will live with his parents for as long as it takes to save enough $ to buy a house here. He refuses to get a cheaper rental so that we can have our own privacy. He says the only way he will move out of their house is if I agree to move to another state where he feels it is cheaper to live in. He also refuses to get any of our belongings (we have been living without our clothing and shoes and belongings now for 6 months) because he put it all in a storage unit in Florida because he “assumed” that is where we would end up living. NO MAN- that is where YOU wanted us to live.z I never agreed to that at all and after finally getting this guy to sell the house, I left the storage unit and moving truck up to him. This is where he puts all of our belongings. His answer to that is he felt that I would “change my mind” and agree to go there as he wanted. 

So I have been living here in these horrible conditions and I don’t have any of my clothes or stuff that my children need. I have to go to a thrift store weekly to buy clothes because we have none of our own. Not to mention, here are the other reasons for why I hate my life here: 

- [ ] My mother in law is the most disrespectful b*tch I have ever met in my life. We fight daily. To the point where she gets up and leaves the house and doesn’t come back until the next day. 
- [ ] I know where MY $ is going because I got smart and started putting it away. But my husband is using his paycheck to pay for their expenses, and allows his mother to treat me badly and tells me to just stop fighting with her. 
- [ ] My husband refuses to leave from these conditions unless I agree to move out of the state and he uses the storage unit as our hostage because he knows that we need it. He says that he doesn’t have any $ to get a moving truck to bring it back up here. 
- [ ] AGAIN- the mother in law is a b*TCH from HELL and my husbands answer to it all is to “just ignore her”.  How am I supposed to just ignore her when we are living in a 4x4 1200 sq ft ranch house with 1 bathroom and there is no place for me to go where there is privacy or I can get away from her. Bad enough I have to sleep with my kids because there is only one bed. My husband sleeps on the couch. 
- [ ] I am essentially paying their bills and not saving nearly as much as I thought we would be doing by staying here. But my husband won’t admit that he is doing so.
- [ ] I can’t even begin to go into the horrid living conditions that we have encountered living here. They haven’t updated their appliances in over 30 years. They have a septic system. The whole thing blew the first week we got here and shit was literally all over the house and yard. Then a month later, the pipes burst, causing us to be without water for days. I had to take a shower at my job which is in a hospital for 3 days. After that, their refrigerator blew. Went 4 days without any refrigeration of food that the food had to be left outside in the cold to be used as a refrigerator. A week after that? Their heater blew. Was then without heat for 3 days and that forced me to go to a hotel with my kids because it’s the winter in the northeast.
- [ ] Should I go on????  

I need HELP. I was trying my best not to break up my family and have my children go through a divorce but it looks like I have no other option. My parents have been telling me that I should leave and get an apartment on my own with the kids and leave him with his parents. Like I said, I have been trying to avoid all of that. But I can’t live here anymore. I am at the point where I am afraid for my mental health. And yes, I have tried to talk to my husband about all of it. His repeated answer is “you should have taken a job offer in those other states that were offering you $ and we would have had a place to live then”.

He says that if I want to live in this state then I need to live with his parents until we are able to save up enough $. I asked him how long of a timeline this would be and he said approximately one more year. I love my parents and my family and I don’t want to move away from them. But I also know that I can’t financially do this on my own and with all of this adversity, I was sincerely and genuinely trying to keep my family together. I just don’t feel like you should pick a place to live based off of a job offer. It should be the place you WANT to live, and to from there. We made the mistake of moving far away once before. I am trying to be smart this time around.

I've been homeless in the past, but don't have extensive experience sleeping outside.

I'm presently living in the UK, and am going to be sleeping rough for a while whilst I build my web dev portfolio and get work.

I'm incredibly light weight and susceptible to the cold, and it seems layering how I have has done me little good (at one point using a shirt, hoodie, then outer jacket still wasn't enough.)

Plus my hands and legs/feet get freezing cold.

Any advice clothing wise / sleeping location wise on how to deal with all this?

I don't have money to get any expensive clothing, so I'm pretty much limited to things you could find at a thrift shop.

""The temporary boost to SNAP benefits put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, known as emergency allotments, will end nationwide after the February 2023 issuance.""

[Official bulletin on the USDA website](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/changes-2023-benefit-amounts)

Emergency allotments have already ended in the following states:  Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wyoming.  (Not surprisingly, all red states.)

The government is always very cost conscious when it comes to helping people.  You know who *never* cuts their budget?  The Pentagon.  I don't need to tell you how goddamn expensive food has gotten.  I guess they expect poor people to live off peanut butter and Ritz crackers.

I've been lurking this sub a lot and I have been getting tips on how to survive on the street from here. But that was before my husband decided to up and leave me out here alone in the woods in a tent with no way to survive. Became homeless  right before new years before we were staying with my family member who ended up moving someone in that was prostituting and bringing drugs in (I don't do drugs) and one of the men she brought in tried sexually assaulting me so that was the end of that. Well last night I started crying because I'm trying so hard to cope with the situation, and my husband got mad and we got into and he left. Long story short, he messaged me and said he found a way back to his hometown across the state and I'm on my own. He's been acting off but I didn't think anything of it, and now I'm wondering if he was planning to leave me out here. Now I'm stuck, afraid and not sure what to do. I contacted women's shelters and the only ones here are full at the moment, and I got myself on a waiting list for another organization for housing but it's a long wait. My dad said I can come stay with him but I have absolutely no way there, no Uber or bus ticket. He's disabled and can't come get me. I've thought about hitchhiking but very afraid since I'm a small petite woman with no way to protect myself. I do have a tent but I'm deathly afraid to be in woods alone at night because there are some really shady people around. I wasn't expecting this at all. I just need some words of encouragement. Some hope. Or even stories of escaping homelessness, so I too can have hope that there's a way. Thank you.

Can I get pros and cons about this

Edit: a lot of people are asking how these are going to be built. What a bout a shower and other stuff. I myself live in a trailer I don’t have the money to make luxury homes. When I say 6x6w 5t that’s pretty much it. The only thing it will have is insulation for warmth, a door to get inside, wheels to transport it and maybe a nice carpet for comfort. I don’t have thousands of dollars to make these it will be coming out of my own pocket.  

I don’t have money to hook up heating and plumbing especially if I don’t have heating in my place and most of MY plumbing doesn’t work. I’m not buying them solar panels or giving them fancy camping equipment because I simply don’t know who will sell it for drugs. 

I have a pretty good idea on who the homeless are in my area and which ones are trying to better themselfs because I give away free food everyday. I work at dominos and everyday I get our canceled orders and go around town handing out pizzas. I know most of the homeless will try and sell their tiny homes for drugs so they need to b as basic as possible. 

Per the California Residential Code, detached accessory structures that do not exceed 120 sq. ft. and do not contain plumbing, electrical, and/or mechanical equipment, do not require a building permit.  

Im conclusion they will not have heating pluming electricity or machanical equipment so they don’t need a permit

Edit #2: after a lot of research I found if they build it I won’t be liable for anything. And it kills two birds in one stone 1. Liability 2. Who gets one. If they don’t want to make it then they won’t get one (I will help so if they don’t have skills it doesn’t matter) and if they’re on drugs they won’t be able to focus enough to build it",Agreeable_Roll1150,38,1,3,1530

I started out with a good amount of money for an apartment ($5K+), but the housing crisis has proven to be much more of a challenge than I anticipated. I've written a lot about this phenomenon so I won't elaborate further but, in a nutshell, it's near-impossible to qualify for even a shitty apartment under these circumstances. Every listing on the Big Five (rental apps) has hundreds of competing applicants, as well as extremely difficult requirements. Managers can (and are) being extremely picky about who they're allowing in. Only the perfect are allowed now, but they don't mind taking your application fee.

I've spent most of my funds staying in cheap motels while I apply for apartments all around the Valley. I could've spent a lot of those evenings sleeping in my car, but the freezing temperatures and rain were too much for my aging body and my cats. I never imagined that I would still be looking (and hemorrhaging funds) a month later.

I no longer have enough money to get an apartment, so I must shift my thinking to buying a minivan or small RV with the remaining $3,000.

Then they feel that 25% of homeless are drug users, the ones that the news shows like walking zombies. 

Another 25% are mentally ill, but dangerous. Throwing feces, robbing, commit dangerous crimes, etc. 

Another 10% veterans, perhaps, but who refuse help, safe but a burden to others. 

Maybe 15% are mothers and children; who are reaping what they sow by having so many kids and choose to be dropouts.

10lzser,"Believe Me I Know I'm from New York City, The Bronx. I know what it feels like to be Homeless...and on drugs. It was Crack for me. Though it was only for I think, I'm not sure because when you're out on the street, you go by seasons... temperatures so. So it was during the Summer and lasted until when it started getting warm again.

The best advice I can give my Brothers and Sisters of the Streets.. Never give up on hope, stay true to your beliefs. Ask before anything else. Don't blame anyone else, especially yourself. And no matter what..'Have manners'. Thank you, yes, no, excuse me. I was homeless, but I became a different type and kind of homeless.

Back when I was growing up in the 60's people weren't called homeless, they were called a Bum. So I became a Bum. When I was young, I respected The Bum(s) in my neighborhood, on my block. My mother and father did, so I HAD to. They called us by names, they knew us. I never seen my parents actually talking to any of them, so I questioned how did they know I names. Because they LIVED on the streets. I would never see them at night, during holidays or when there was a snow storm or when it was raining cats & dogs. Other than that, they became a fixture. Sanitation trucks, garbage trucks...this was the era of the metal garbage cans, building being heated by coal in the winter time. The Bums would sweep up what the garbage truck dropped in the streets. After coal is burned, it's the ash and that has to be collected too. They would help those collectors by bringing the spent coal cans closer to the truck and then cleaning up after the workers dumped the cans..handing Bums $1..which was a while lot in the late 60's. So if I was to survive being in the streets of where I was homeless at, I had to make myself useful. And that I did.

Started with helping people, women with just when they came downstairs to throw garbage away, I would take it and I'll do that. And they would say thank you, me: No problem. Then women looking out side their windows .'Hey you, can you go to the store for me?' Throwing money out the window wrapped in paper. Go to the store and bring back their items and their change. I would always return it even after they say keep it. Then I was offered taking showers, then sleeping inside their apartment by the door with a blanket. Indie that once. They offered, but they were still Shakey about me sleeping inside, so they would stay up all night. Then I wasn't homeless any more. Went to my mother's house and that was that.

I started working, but knew I wanted more out of life. I'm a Cook, well I was. MY mother passed away, and I left NYC for upstate NY packed bag and my laptops. Found a place and a job the same night sitting in The bus station. No money in my pocket, so how did I find a place to stay? A woman came in to use the bathroom, and since I got off the bus, they had to give me the key, I was a paying customer. When she came out, she said thank you and ask me what was I doing and I told her. She said she has a 4 bedroom home with just her, and for $500 a month she'll give me a room. I told her I start a job, told who it was with and she said she knew them, the business. She said I won't charge you until starting the next month. This was the 12th if the month presently. Stayed with her for 2 years and left for Charlotte, NC.

Real fast now.. Charlotte, men's shelter, got place, stayed for 2 years, wanted to go some place else, but not NYC.. Pittsburgh, homeless on the streets while working for 3 weeks, paid hotel room cleaners $20 to take quick shower every 2, 3 days, worker told me about a room, stayed for 2 years, back to NYC, shelter for Veterans, working, got apartment, Pandemic, no work, not paying rent, saved up $60, Virginia, shelter, working, offered Section 8 thru Veterans Administration, accepted, moved in July last year.

But being how it happened, and I'm not being a  predator. If a woman I see on the streets are homeless, I offered hera 3 night stay, but if I leave, she has to leave but can come back. I wash her clothes, she can eat anything and how much she wants providing she washes her hands first. Take a shower as often as she wants, soak in my CLAW FOOTED BATHTUB! For as long as she wants. That's my giving back. I won't do it for guys, because I trust them and I will fall asleep. But with women, I force myself to stay up because I don't trust them. Yeah stuff have been taken, earbuds, a couple of laptops..but it is what it is. I dont get mad because I was GIVEN a Section 8 Voucher. So I'm looking out, I'm doing my part for being thankful and grateful. 

But I'm afraid, afraid that at any minute all this will be taken away from me. Believe it or not, I'm more afraid than when I didn't have. I'm 62 and my body is going thru changes, it's getting old and worn out. I don't go anywhere, I don't do anything. I spend my time reading, on the internet, learning to use a DJ Controller, make my own music, learned Adobe Animate. And wait for SS check every month. It bothers the fuck out of me to hear what people go thru on here from those that have..have a roof over their head..able to be warm from the elements outside. To just exhale and sleep. I know what it feels like to have all that stress and tension in your neck muscles. I know what it feels like to have your feel sore and hurting from constantly moving from one place to another. If not having anyone to talk to.. or go 4  days and realize you haven't spoken a single word to anyone including yourself. And hungry, hunger. To be hungry is the worst feeling in the world. But to eat after not eating for 3 days is also the worst feeling because the. Your stomach cramps up and not too many places will let you use their bathroom. So you go where you can, and clean yourself as best as you can.

People with homes...a corner in thier apartments, houses with basements... People should be given an incentive to take in screened homeless people and get paid by the Federal Government. Each Homeless person she have have an ID with a number where they can be tracked for safety purposes only. Are told where they can go for the night, 2 nights, 3 nights to...get a shower, hot meal and able to sleep over night. Be in by a certain time and out by a certain time..with a hot breakfast. Of course those providing all of this, are and will be paid by the Federal government, but they took, SCREENED AND FINGERPRINTED.

They are opening Section 8 again. You would think so. All these homes built and no one to live in them. People are losing out on their investments. Wait, the homeless, they have something we have and they need.. No, no, NO my friend, my property owner, you want to be my landlord. I, being Homeless with a HUD VASH Voucher, Housing Choice Vouchers and Section 8 Voucher... I have something YOU NEED...ME!!",Idar77,5,2,3,1530

-if you dumpster dive, hit the recycling bins because you can find cardboard and often times styrofoam. Layer these (styrofoam first, then cardboard) this will help retain warmth. 
-once tent is up, insulate walls. If you can get you hands on blankets they work well, wool works awesome- cover entire tent with tarp to repellent water. 
-if you can get your hands on a small bail of hay or wood chips, lay on bottom against ground, then cardboard. 
If you can insulate with one method for floor and one for walls and it's not an excessively large tent, you can heat it from a small candle and retain heat once candle is out. 
-layers! Dress in layers. Cotton, woolblend or alternative, cotton or water repellant clothes.

To be clear; For the record: I was NOT homeless because I had a drinking or drug problem. And as for marrying a fine Christian woman who keeps me on the straight and narrow... lol that ain't gonna work out well for me or for her. But I am happy it worked out well for Officer Noname.

At home, there were always the bills to pay, pets to feed (and vet bills), groceries to buy and the constant stream of never-ending daily chores/repairs. It was just a daily grind of the same old things every day and it would get super-old after awhile.

Living on the streets or vagabonding gave me a sense of freedom and adventure. One day I might be standing in line for free donuts and coffee and the next day I might be having a beer with some random dude on a shrimp boat. No day...hour...or even minute was ever the same and I had no responsabilities.

10jknbk,"Homelessness is a choice for many but not for me I made other choices that ultimately landed me here on the street. I was in the work force, I was comfortable at times, and in the interest of my health, my time, my future I chose to jump forward into being a full time student of yoga, without any personal teacher or tutor of my own. 

Every day that goes by someone comes along blabbing about homelessness being a choice, that I need to 'get the fuck off the steet man' and I now feel terrible that I ever let anyone in on this myself. Because I was homeless by choice as a drug addict at 14. And it was different. 

I almost never meet other homeless people with their heads screwed on. Sometimes I'm afraid they're dead, but I realize most of them went through years of turmoil before finally getting an alignment of decisions and circumstance which carry them all the way out. 

Ive been through treatment for my mild disorder. Which is BPD and General Anxiety + Chronic Depression. 

At 17 I got to a point in treatment where I was informed clearly, all I had left to do was take what I learned and move on with it. Other things can be tried in terms of technique, but the ones I've found that are effective on people dealing with mild but chronic addictions are just inaccessible. Joe Dispenza has a great program, but it costs so fucking much. You have to have a terminal illness to send in for free tickets

There are others who have proven solutions for depression that cant be put behind you with any obvious lifestyle change. But it costs crazy money. 

I can't even share space as a worker with most other people. Im still a full time student of yoga, so when I go into work I am a full time student of yoga. I'm not a regular dude who wants to go out for drinks, I don't have any method for absorbing bullshit all day and excreting it as rainbows. And overall my journey with yoga is for me to overcome not only the mental but also many physical issues I deal with. That means if I have back issues while working, I'm not going to push further. I've had compressed discs during adolescence and later. It hurts like hell and the more it happens the more dangerous it is. 

I will stop whatever I am doing, give or take a few minutes to do some yoga. That applies to my Jnana Yoga too, so when things get mentally unmanageable I am not pushing any harder for you or your business. I have to go meditate, or write. I have been struggling with suicide all my life. Putting myself in situations that worsen that feeling. Changing my response past a point will put me out of touch with myself. Although I do adjust my attitude for the better wherever possible


And more. It's cold as fuck. I usually dont wear socks and I have on slips to avoid toe fungus. It's too much to constantly use foot spray and carry around nasty old socks. Washing them proactively doesn't help either where laundry costs 7 dollars a load here. Yet people will still look at you like you are the asshole for doing the right thing for yourself. 

That look is so distinct. It starts with an 'ugh who are you' look and extends to an 'youve been here for 6 months and I still don't see your drugs WHERE IS THE DRUGS'

And they hide it behind stupid questions like 'why don't you just get a place' 'why not just get a job' 'whats going on with you?' and when it's not the answer they want or expect, they forget what I say and repeat the next day. 80% of conversations end with 'Oh. Ok.'

I stay in Frisco because of its accessibility to services but that doesn't mean that Frisco is ending homelessness. It's easy ish to get a place if you are local to the Tenderloin or the Mission. But I mean, really local or you need an in. 

North Beach Citizens which is nearest to me, told me they just are not interested in helping me because they have other priorities. 

I'm fairly certain I'm gonna die somewhere in the midst of this, with the people who run rampant at night and how much they choose to bother me. I don't look particularly jacked up, so most people assume I am hiding money drugs or both.

It's fucked up. If there was a delete button for 'assumptions people made about homelessness' I would just press it regardless of anybody's free will. The shit is ridiculous and the world looks even more bleak with the amount of nonsense being perpetuated on the net. 

No, help is not available for just anyone. No it does not work that way. Every program is different. I get state benefits and have MediCal, but I can't get ERAP to move on my fucking case to get me into a place. No matter what I do. It's been 6 months of that and even longer just being homeless generally

There's no point here and I wish that more people could see there's very little point to the struggles of homeless people. Like I saw someone else mention the cause of homelessness is not actually drugs it's lack of housing / funding. Drugs inspire voluntary homelessness for sure but that doesn't make everyone on the street a meth user

In so many cases we don't have that funding or housing because of the disgusting spitefulness of our chosen elites on the national level. All of whom believe far worse things about homeless people than most every day folk. And yet will lie to their death bed about it, thus making the situation worse. I don't give a fuck who wants votes or approval I'm feeling like punching the TV when I hear people say 'all people deserve housing. We are going to end homelessness.'

Motherfucker. No you aren't, you're going to do an end homelessness media campaign and then take the clout elsewhere. As soon as it gets worse again, the meek will be blamed for it. Up to whatever the breaking point is where everyone loses their shit altogether

10jc0na,"I don't even know where to begin Hey y'all. This may be a long post so buckle in.  Last Wednesday, my daughter, my two doggerinas, and I were booted from our apartment after I had been trying for months to avoid this from happening.

Long story kinda short, I work at a psychiatric hospital, and a few months ago I was assaulted by one of my patients, leaving me with severe head trauma, slipped disks in my cervical spine, and a bunch of other neat stuff. After being out of work for some time, my job brought me back on light duty, with a severe reduction of hours. I was hanging on there for a while, barely able to cover all of my bills, but I basically tapped out of my savings around October. 

Back around Novemberish I got hooked up with a volunteer organization that helps homeless vets. They said that they'd help me get caught up with my rent. Cool. Unfortunately the approval process was slower than slow and I just kept getting more and more behind on my rent. I kept my landlord updated on the process as much as I could, but I still ended up having to go to court a week before Christmas. My caseworker FINALLY got approval for my rent assistance, but then my landlord decided to drag their feet with sending the proper paperwork from their end. Two weeks ago, my caseworker sent my assistance checks in the mail, and forwarded promissory notes and scanned copies of the checks to my landlord. I thought everything was figured out so I spent my last check getting caught up on bills. Then Tuesday morning my door gets practically beaten down by a sheriff and six other cops. 

My landlord told me that since the checks didn't arrive by Monday that I was forced to vacate. They said it didn't matter that the checks got delayed in the mail or that they were dated before their ""deadline"" that they never told me about. Basically said ""sucks to suck"". They told me I had seven days to get my things but they wouldn't even let me in the apartment at all last week. 

I'm so scared. Kiddo and the pups and I have been bouncing around Airbnbs and hotels since. My daughter's friend's parents offered to let her stay with them for a few weeks so that's a blessing. But I'm so overwhelmed. Now I have an eviction on my credit so no one will rent to me. My caseworker is just as puzzled as I am that the apartments refused the money. I have to call her today to find out if she has any next steps. This still feels like a horrible dream.

10ilegi,"How stupid would it be of me to try to build a temporary shelter with the snow? So, in a couple of days, I get evicted from my hotel, and I'm back on the streets of Denver. The city has been really gung-ho about cracking down on camping all of a sudden, and it's made it virtually impossible to find anywhere to sleep. We've also got a ton of snow on the ground right now, and ice on the roads, which is going to make navigating the already terrible sidewalks even worse with my cart of belongings. I'm not really sure how I'm going to handle this.

However, as I was waking up this morning, in that state between being asleep and being awake where I tend to have my best and worst ideas, a thought popped into my head. Could I maybe camouflage my tent by building a pile of snow over it? I remember building snow forts as a kid, and I've got a reasonable idea of how to do it. I would still need to build it in a relatively out of the way place where it wouldn't stand out to people, but I was thinking that MAYBE, since the weather is going to stay cold for weeks, this might give me somewhere to lay low and tell the melt off begins. And then, once things start to melt, I can start working my way toward the edge of the city to try and find somewhere that I can get away with camping a bit easier. There is a park nearby that has some nooks and crannies I MIGHT stand a tiny chance of getting away with this in.

10i4f2r,"PLANNING on homelessness in SF? Where to start? TL;DR Looking for info on how to move into a vehicle in SF, and not go completely insane. 

Longer:

I have a decent job in San Francisco, but am on the edge financially. Debt, etc. 

Also, I am in a horrible marriage that is fundamentally abusive (verbally/emotionally). Not going into details here that's just my situation. 

We live in a house (owned, but mortgage), but I sleep in our daughter's old room, along with junk stored there. All ""my"" stuff - to the extent that stuff defines a life - is packed away. My role there is essentially to be a barely tolerated sidekick, agreeing to every decision, there to be criticized/attacked whenever she's in a bad mood (which is often). The fact that I've endured this for years is my own fault I know. 

I'm just saying the above for context. Please don't give me relationship advice! Been there, ONLY blows up in my face. If anyone suggests ""talking to her"" I will block them. It took me many years, but I know beyond a doubt I have to simply act for myself, and a solution isn't going to fall from the sky. 

So, I had the crazy idea: find a suitable/affordable vehicle (or use my Honda Fit but it's hella small), and hang with those RV mobs I see by SF State and other locations. 

At LEAST I can play music without bothering others, or go to the bathroom (probably in a bucket) without getting a report card on how someone was inconvenienced. There's an affordable gym near work for showers etc. 

And either drive or take public transportation to work (Civic Center). 

There MUST be people who've done this, are doing it, right? Even older people (60's) like me?

So I'm mainly just looking where to *start* looking. What have people done already? Are there subreddits? Blogs? Community?

It’s not because of money, it’s due to his pretty severe criminal record. He has multiple drug charges and 2 criminal drug convictions. He did time in prison, but has apparently been living in an abandoned shed since getting out 4 years ago. He has been completely sober for over 3 years and hasn’t missed a day of work. He is a senior gentleman as well. I have already reached out and met with a housing organization in our county and he is now enrolled in a program that is helping him find a suitable place. He also has an advocate who he gave me permission to work with as well. The advocate says since he’s high functioning, he will likely be expedited. Even so, his advocate doesn’t expect him to be able to find suitable housing for another 3-6 months. We are in Ohio and it’s cold. I personally put him in a hotel for a week and have given him a few food gift cards. What else can I do for him for the time being? He has a difficult time navigating computers and researching help. I’ve also enrolled him in our employee assistance program, and he’s in therapy once a week. I let him use my office, close the door and I leave alone for his sessions. I give him ride to and from his shed as often as I can. I have also ordered him a new birth certificate. Once it comes in we are getting him a state ID and a new social security card as well. I’m working on expunging his convictions as well, but it’s a long and complicated process. I also gave him 2 large bins of warm, gently used clothing. He’s currently using a propane heater. I guess some specific questions -

He needs a bicycle. Does anyone have any recommendations? He also wishes he had equipment to be able to cook.

Back in July I was sleeping in my friend’s car and jumping over pool gates to use the shower. I became homeless because I tried to report a co-worker harassing me when I was working at the casino. The surveillance would have proved me right but Human Resources called me and fired me… probably because she worked at the company a lot longer and had family members working there too. If I had known I was going to be fired, I would have kept my mouth shut and allowed the harassment… I begged for them to separate us and keep my job and they told me I could reapply in the future but I knew they were not going to re hire me for whistle blowing her. Anyway, homelessness can happen to anyone. I was living in a friend’s car because I didn’t have a car. Went to Starbucks and libraries for internet to apply to jobs during the daytime. I eventually got a job and started to team up with someone down on his luck and we shared a room at motel 6, both working. Now we have allowed another homeless person to move in with us and we got a slightly bigger room at a different hotel that has a kitchen and a closet. It takes sacrifice and a lot of days were frustrating. Sacrifice of privacy too… anyway I paid all my bills yesterday and it feels good to have $165 to last me 2 weeks til my next paycheck. 
For a lot of people $165 is scary to survive on but for me and the past 7 months I have had less than $15 in my pocket at all times. Living off bread, noodles, rice and top ramen… 
Obviously I should be on food stamps but I didn’t have a mailing address and I don’t know if I qualify because I have a Nevada license but now living in California…  I guess I just came here to say 3 heads are better than 1.

I have met other people in my situation and talked with locals who try to help. I feel like there's a gap that could be bridged with something like a discord server so that solutions could be communicated in real time, directly between those who need it and those who provide it. I think it could also open more honest communication and facilitate better understanding of what is *actually* needed on a larger scale (like regionally).

I spoke to a newish group that I came across through facebook this week. I mentioned my idea and they sounded pretty interested. Honestly, they've been the only charitible group that has been open to listening and adapting. So, I really think this general idea has the possibility of succeeding and really changing the way things are... at least around my area.

I'm wondering though, if anyone else has had an online forum succeed and if so, can I get a link for some guidance? Or, if you've thought about something similar, what kind of topics did you want to include? And, for anyone thats discord savvy, how do I set this up to be safe and make sense to users? I'm sure it would need to be highly moderated and submissions would have to be formatted... but what rules should be added/ avoided?

Edit to add: any general info on waivers or how to approach local businesses about how they could help would be great. I feel like many places don't want overnight parkers bc of insurance liability and maybe there is room for a liability waiver paired with terms of use? Also, just getting permission is one thing but then the cops roll up bc night shift and day shift dont communicate so having a blank form to show who said it was ok would be on my priority list. So is there a freebie site for customized  like this?

Older people tend to have various geriatric needs/conditions. High blood pressure, circulation/cardio issues, skin conditions, foot problems, mobility and digestive issues, etc. Just a whole lot of possible things. It's a lot easier for a young, strong, healthy person to get around than it is for someone in thier 60's with back problems, arthritis and COPD.

How do you deal with being elderly as a homeless person?. I would think a warm climate and a decent shelter with the long-term goal of getting stable housing and decent medical care. I mean, I've never seen anyone hitch-hiking with a cane or a back brace so these people must be already housed, yes?.",veryberryblue,42,1,3,1530

Jan 6 I moved into a regular apartment, not subsidized, no more food stamps, no one looking over my shoulder.  I don't have to worry about getting kicked out unless I actually do something bad.  No more drug tests to stay in a halfway house or transitional housing (I've had a few beers, drinking wasn't what destroyed me) and I had false positives when I was on probation and almost wound up in prison...  I was afraid I would pop for a cross test that I stopped taking badly needed psych meds.  I as I got things together was afraid it would all fail because one of the crazies in the building both residents and staff would corner me and I would need to defend myself. 

This is not bragging, but I clawed out and make good money now, more than the average in the us...  

I saw so many give up and think it would never get better...

My best friend in transitional housing was capable of as much or more than me but he just gave up and took a job he could never live on and is trying to get subsidized housing, if there is a reason that that's all you can do i don't knock it, but he could make good money and live well but has just been beat down by it all...

I have severe depression so I’m with them all day every day and even when I manage to get up to go to the store or something, when I come back they run around and meow at me like I was gone forever.

I think they have separation anxiety because even when I go downstairs to use the kitchen (I’m only allowed to have them in my room since I was sharing a home), they bang on the bedroom door and meow loudly for at least 20 mins. 

They’re also both really affectionate and want snuggles and pets every day all day, but they don’t really trust anyone else. Especially the boy cat, it took years to get him to snuggle with me.

10d1jc2,"""I Live on the Balcony"" - Part 2 Despite the divorce, the biggest reason I came back to Los Angeles was for work. 

When I left for Florida last January I was the #1 handyman/mover on Taskrabbit. My rate was $125/hour (plus tips), and even working just 1 or 2 hours a day I was able to get by. I didn’t stress out. I could spend most of my days running, skateboarding, editing videos, cooking, and just riding the train somewhere. I could be creative during the downtime. I didn’t have to take on every client request I received.

In Tampa, I could barely charge $60 and get any sort of demand. I averaged less than one client a month. My work life imploded as soon as I got there, and my marriage suffered because of it. I couldn’t find consistent work in the industry I knew, and with so many projects and contractors involved in renovating the house we had bought, I couldn’t commit to a traditional 9 to 5. When we broke up in May, I was certain I could get back to Los Angeles and rebuild. 

That didn’t happen.

Upon my return in October, I discovered the entire Taskrabbit platform was suffering nationwide. Demand was down by 90% for some people, despite impeccable 5-star reviews and reasonable rates accounting for inflation and rising gas prices. Clients were no longer paying. Taskrabbit denied any sort of drop in demand, but talk amongst Taskers said otherwise. The company encouraged everyone to lower their rates, even though doing so hurt the bottom line of both the company and the contractors. If we made less, they made less, and Taskers were encouraged into bidding wars with each other.

The gig-economy and on-demand service industry was not the same one I had left. Covid had finally caught up with us.

I’ve averaged two clients a month since being back. Of course, that’s ignoring the unrealistic requests like hoisting a pre-built king-sized bed frame up to a second-story balcony. Some times clients are just insane.

I signed up for Central Casting, but the few callbacks I’ve gotten were for locations in Simi Valley and Castaic- places where I would end up making $40 for 8-hours of work after paying for the gas to get there and back. My tattoos also seem to limit me to being typecast as a construction worker, biker, lumberjack, and MMA fighter. Tattoos are distracting to the audience if they aren’t on a main character. Still, no ragrets.

I also took a job as a bouncer at a bar I loved, but at some point I hit on the wrong person on my day off. It paid terribly and had terrible hours, and the tips were insulting ($7/night on average), but at least it reminded me why I hate the corporate work environment. Policy and protocol and the employee handbook say one thing, but it doesn’t matter if you’re in an at-will state because you can be fired at anytime. So I was.

I’m not sure if any of my coworkers even knew I was homeless. I mentioned staying with friends and sleeping in my truck several times, but I never explicitly told them why.

I think I have PTSD from the house renovations. I’d rather be homeless in Los Angeles than a homeowner in Florida. Maybe I’m finally understanding the mentality of a large part of the homeless population.

Back to job-searching for now.",405freeway,10,1,3,1530

I read about the daily thefts, assaults, feces, drugs, needles all over the place, etc. Not exactly my idea of a fun time and yet, it seems like the west coast is always in the news and people tend to flock there because of all the social services, weather, beaches and the care-free lifestyle.

I'm mainly talking about San Diego, San Francisco and other cities in Cali. I've watched a lot of videos about people who were really down on thier luck, went out west and were super happy there. They talk about getting free motel rooms, free money, eating like kings or queens, getting free medical/dental care, hanging out all day with thier buddies and getting drunk, cops being pretty chill, etc. I mean, I have to be honest...it does sound pretty tempting for someone who is totally down on thier luck but...

How do you stay safe?. I wouldn't want to live in a shelter with a bunch of violent people, bedbugs, etc and the thought of staying in a tent and getting awakened at 3:00AM by some tweaker with a machete isn't exactly appealing either. Any first steps to take when, for example, you arrive in San Diego or San Francisco and how do you get help and stay safe and avoid all (or most) of the bad/sketchy stuff?.",veryberryblue,3,2,8,1024

10cox2e,"The man-hamster. All species of animals are born with the nature-given freedom to gather and eat food. The freedom to drink from streams and rivers, and the freedom to sleep where they please.

All animals have this freedom. But it is taken away from humans. We are not allowed to hunt or fish (without expensive license and too many limits to survive on), we re not allowed to start a fire to cook, we are not allowed to gather fruits and vegetables anywhere legally, and all edible plants and trees have been purposely removed from public spaces. Hell we aren't even allowed to bathe or drink from rivers and streams because they've either been fenced off, diverted into pipes, or polluted by for-profit industries. OR it has simply been deemed as not-allowed, and you can be punished for trying.

Squirrels, mice, birds, deer, and other wild animals still can... they can eat and drink anything they see outdoors, and can sleep anywhere they want. But not humans. Humans have been purposefully limited/imprisoned in their world. This is true all over the world, in almost all societies.

Considering we are being actively and purposefully limited/imprisoned in our own world, those who are responsible for our status must provide us with alternative sources of food. If they do not, then this is tantamount to cruelty or torture.

It's like keeping a hamster locked up in a cage.. or a cat locked up in your house. once you take responsibility for this animal by locking them up and away from their natural food source, you BECOME RESPONSIBLE for feeding them. NOT feeding them would be cruel torture. Leaving them outdoors, chained to a rope in your yard when it is freezing out would also be torture. It would be considered Animal Abuse, and the owner would literally go to jail for it.

Humans are no different. Domesticated humans in a domesticated society wherever every aspect and food source is tightly controlled MUST BE FED. They MUST BE HOUSED. This is not an option. This is a ETHICAL REQUIREMENT on us, the society that actively enforces this environment.

The responsibility falls 100% on those in charge to give them access to food and housing. This is not a favor. This is not altruism. This is not self entitlement. This is not ""asking others to help.""

This is the caged hamster, stuck in a cage, waiting to be fed by those that put him in that cage.

This is BASIC HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY.

Some people claim, that if you didn't withhold food and shelter from humans, that they would not want to work or do anything to contribute to society. That's Nonsense. There are endless ways to incentivize people to work, be creative, and be productive. Too many to list. Love, admiration, fame, dreams, ideas. Nevermind plain old cash money and all the things it buys. Luxury cars, travel all over the world, vacation resorts, etc etc... but using FOOD and SHELTER, or the THREAT of HUNGER and COLD/DANGER as a bargaining tool or motivator to get people to do what you want them to do, is simply unethical. The lowest form of humanity. This affects EVERYONE because it brings ALL over humanity down to the level of slaves.

This is like forcing elephants to do tricks for food. That's not legal anymore either. This is why circuses all closed down. It is unethical. And it is about time that this is reflected for humans too.",tuggyforme,68,1,3,1530

10c3prd,"I Live on the Balcony - Part 1 I grew up here. But I left, and came back. I wasn’t even gone that long but things are different. It took five days to get from Tampa to Los Angeles. 

I had already removed the back seats in my truck and built a platform to sleep on, with storage underneath, and a yoga mat, pillow, and blanket laid out on top. Space was limited, so I couldn’t bring much with me. Everything else was left behind with with my parents.

The first night I slept in my truck at a rest stop just west of Memphis. I wasn’t ready for the change in weather, going from muggy Florida heat to the bitter Arkansas cold. My blanket wasn’t thick enough and I started to get sick.

The next day I met an internet friend just north of Dallas. We had played Among Us throughout the pandemic but never seen each other IRL. When I got there we had a bonfire at the lakefront behind his house, drinking whiskey and beer, and eating Nepali barbecue. It was some of the best tasting food I’ve ever had. I was so exhausted from the drive that I passed out on the ground and got bug bites all over my forearms. Thankfully the rest of the night was spent in a real bed.

The third day was the longest- exactly one thousand miles to a rest stop south of Sedona. I hit a major rainstorm in Flagstaff and stopped at a Target for some generic-brand Nyquil and a 4-pack of local IPAs. There were college kids everywhere inside. The drive down to the rest stop through the Coconino forest was pitch black and the roads were slick. I was happy to be done for the night and downed half the bottle of medicine.

When I woke up, the sunrise was barely illuminating the mountains and I remembered why I wanted to stop here: Northern Arizona is one of the most beautiful places on the planet. I took a scenic route through Cottonwood back into Sedona for food at the Coffee Pot Restaurant. It was exactly how I remembered it from when I first visited 15 years ago. After a breakfast of biscuits and gravy I took the road back to Cottonwood and made my way up to Jerome, a small historic boomtown on the side of many cliffs. I pulled over to walk around and admire the dilapidated buildings, still standing despite the overwhelming feeling of ruin and abandonment throughout the streets. Other tourists did the same, dipping into cafes and gift shops. I continued driving on to Whiskey Row in Prescott to have a quick beer at the Palace Saloon, then headed south toward Phoenix. I had more friends in Tempe hosting me that night, and they treated me to beer and arcade games at BRI Taproom followed by dinner and drinks at Lom Wong.

I stayed one more day in Tempe, suffering through my sickness. It was a work day, so my friends were gone, and I didn’t do much of anything besides rest. In the evening they treated me once again, this time to burgers and beer at the Chuckbox. I liked that place.

I felt much better and left early the next morning before my friends did. I wanted to beat as much traffic as possible. I gassed up before leaving the state (it was much cheaper due to lower Arizona taxes) and continued over the horizon into California. As I started the downhill descent towards Indio I could see the Salton Sea, an environmental disaster that was dressed up as a paradise for decades before becoming a saline wasteland of toxic dust, but I still want to visit someday. In Thousand Palms I stopped at In-N-Out for my first meal back as a Californian. It was perfect. Then, finally, I reached Los Angeles.",405freeway,11,2,12,1488

I am clean and sober now. I am currently living in low income housing. I was on short term disability from work due to my physical health and then they told me they were transferring me to long term disability (through an insurance company). I did not plan for it to take this long. The process started all the way back in November. I was told 60 days at the most. I got a letter from the insurance company last week saying that they still have not received all of my records in order for them to make a decision to approve me for long term disability. I had to call all of my doctors (which a few of them told me it was bs and they already sent them a few copy’s of my records). So here I am, without pay, not being able to pay rent, and the insurance company is taking their time while not even responding to me. Every time I call I get “sorry, the person you are trying to contact is with another client” and no email back. Even if I call and try to explain what is going on I get “sorry, I have to transfer you to your claim manager”. It’s complete bs.

With my rent I had to complete paper work stating I am no longer receiving pay. Since I got a partial pay back in December they are making me pay rent for December but they are trying to make me pay rent (more than $500) for January when I have absolutely no money coming in. It totals out to be a little more than $1000. They asked me if I can pay the $500 and I said there’s no way. They said “don’t worry about it for the weekend. We’ll let you know next week.” I do plan on getting the money out of my 401k but that is not even $200.

If I get evicted, I honestly would not care to leave the city I am staying in. There has been a ton of trauma that has happened to me here. I want to leave this place behind. I live in Pittsburgh. I would have no problem packing up a book bag, getting on a bus, and going to a different city (as long as I can afford it). I do have state insurance and on life sustaining meds so would need insurance in a different state. I may be better off staying in PA. I have considered moving to Erie.

The apartment I was supposed to move into failed the mention the qualifications to move in. So inevitably I couldn't move in. I do not make five times the income of the apartment nor do I have 3 grand to give, and I didn't have a co signer close by. So they told me I had to leave.

Now I'm currently in a shelter; no friends, family, no home and little money. All I have are suitcases. I'm hoping to get a call cack from a job in a couple days, but that's not a full proof plan. 

I don't know what to do, I'm in an area I don't know and I can't go back to living in the middle of nowhere with no job prospects and literally nothing to do but drink.

I need help, advice, whatever you want to call it. I'm at a loss of what my next step will be",notatyourservice,5,3,3,1530

I have an idea to help people who are trying to get back on their feet. I'm thinking of buying a house with several rooms and renting out beds, like you find in some airbnbs. I would also provide transportation to and from work within a radius of 10-20 miles. This will be in San Bernardino, CA and I would charge $650 per bed per month. This fee would cover utilities and also transport to/from work and maybe to go grocery shopping. Each room would have a max of 4 people.  


So I am posting here to see if this is something people would be interested in and to get any feedback/comments/ or suggestions.

I mean, yeah, I guess you could just ""toughen up"" or ""wish for good luck"" or whatever but seriously, what do you do and how do you survive out there?.

I'm thinking about someone with Alzheimers suddenly being forced out of thier home and landing on the streets. Maybe someone in a wheelchair or someone who just had surgery and has limited mobility. Maybe someone with chronic health issues. Maybe just someone in thier 70's or 80's. Yeah, that sort of thing.

Normally, I guess you would just be expected to ""toughen up"" and get 3 jobs so you could afford to rent some over-priced apartment or hit family/friends up for money or a place to stay but these options simply are not available to everyone.

I'd like to think that other homeless people or Church groups would try to help you. Heck, even in jails and prisons other inmates look after the sick, weak and elderly because heck, it could just as easily be someone in thier own family and I've seen people in wheelchairs out on the streets surrounded by other homeless people taking care of them and watching thier back.

So how do people like this survive out there?. Do they start making calls to various charites?. Just hang out and hope for someone to come by and help them?.

108a0o4,"How I got out of being homeless after 5 years on the street. I am now a homeowner. Greetings to all of you and I hope you're staying warm. It occurred to me this morning, as I held the keys to my new house in my hand, how lucky I am to now be permanently removed from the situation I was previously in. To this day, I am still paranoid, guarded as I sleep, my back hurts -- I bear all the scars of life on the street. But healing now feels possible for me, and I want to share it. Not everything I suggest is possible for everyone who might be reading, but on the odd chance that even one of you here reading this could stand to benefit, I'm happy to write it.

I was homeless for 5 years. Now I am a homeowner. Here are my tips. Please don't take them as some kind of judging statement against folks who for whatever reason couldn't do what I have done. I am sharing mostly to say: if you're sick of where you're at in life, here's at least one proven formula that can work so long as you are capable of working a minimum wage job, using Google, improving your credit, and are 100% flexible with where you wind up so long as you manage to buy a house.



My trick to survival was moving around constantly. I never stayed anywhere for more than a few days. I was always walking, bicycling, hitchhiking, or riding freight trains, figuring that being new in town (and soon to leave) would remove me from the daily dramas of those who are indefinitely on the street in one town. This worked, but it tired me out. I retreated to the forest and built an illegal cabin in a remote area, where I stayed for a winter. This was hard for me, and by spring, I knew I had to do something. I joined the US Coast Guard. I did this because I didn't want to kill anyone, but knew that a stint in the Armed Forces can give someone a big boost. It has worked for me, and if you are under the age of 42, in decent physical shape, with no seriously disqualifying medical history, a minimal criminal record, and no crazy debts or tattoos, you could do this too (we are desperate for new recruits). 

But I am not making a recruiting ad. What I did to secure a house for myself could be done by most people, I would guess -- it just requires a level of flexibility not everyone has. Here are the steps and some considerations:

1. In six states, the minimum wage is over $13/hr. Washington, Oregon, California, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut all pay this fairly substantial sum. No one *wants* to work for minimum, but that wage is just what it says -- the lowest you can go. If the bottom is significantly higher, you can gain. Obviously, you can go to other states, but always do the math of figuring what your mortgage will be and making sure it'll be the same as whatever a week's local minimum wage work will get you, to be safe.

2. The trick is to find the cheapest livable house you can in one of these states -- easier said than done. But not impossible. I was shocked at the sort of house a bank will give a mortgage for! My house needs a new roof, needs new siding, and has a wrecked barn that needs to be torn down. The bank didn't care, and I was able to secure home insurance on it (this was the hardest part) by doing a very extensive search. 

3. But before you can buy a house, you need two things: credit and a down payment. I was always under the impression that these things were out of reach. They aren't. 

4. My advice to anyone who wants out of their tough situation: Take one year and buckle down. Search the whole country for jobs that pay reasonably well. It's winter -- ski country in the intermountain west and Vermont can yield good jobs, often with guaranteed housing. Bus tickets are cheap and in a few days, you can beg enough for one on the street. Get yourself from where you currently are to having *any* job.

5. Get EBT *before* you get a job if you can, to buy yourself 6 months of basic help with food. Usually harder to get once you're working legitimately in my experience.

6. Save every single dollar you get. The goal is to get ~$7k - $8k. 

7. Apply for small credit of any kind. Play the game. Search all over the internet on how to play this game to win as soon as humanly possible. Run all essential purchases through your credit card and pay it religiously *no matter what*. Within 12 - 24 months, you can improve your credit enough to get a tiny mortgage. Keyword: tiny. Very small mortgages are, according to everyone in that industry I spoke with while shopping for loans, way way way easier to qualify for that gigantic $300k mortgages most people seem to get.

8. Search Zillow in high minimum wage states until you find ANY house that appears livable and is under $60k asking price. Be meticulous. Check EVERYWHERE. The longer it's been sitting on the market, the lower your offer can be. The lower your offer is, the lower the down payment and the monthly payment. Contrary to a lot of the complaints about the price of housing, there are many places in the US, even in the high minimum wage states, where livable homes can be purchased for $40k or less. Do keep in mind: it'd be tough to get a mortgage below $30k. The very best you could do is about $35k -- the smallest list price for which you can get a mortgage. 

9. Once your credit is decent and you've got about $8k, call banks. If you've got a target region that has a decent supply of affordable homes, go there and visit credit unions in person if you can. Read the culture of the area: if you're in a rural area or a small town (which you likely will be as most 'cheap' homes in cities are in horrible neighborhoods and come with thousands of dollars in tax penalties etc) don't show up with blue hair and an unkempt beard or in a skimpy dress. Get your clothes from Tractor Supply or Wal-Mart. Speak plainly. Say ""yes sir"" and ""no ma'am"" and ""God bless"". Talk about your ambitions to be hardworking and have a family and go to Church, and be prepared to participate in the community you move to. Even if you don't like this, I promise it's not as bad as it's made out to be -- and owning a house anywhere is better than being homeless. 

10. You will get approved if you can get a 650 credit score, which is not particularly hard to do in my experience if you have a job and exceptionally responsible use of credit for a couple years. I went from a 430 to a 690 in about that time. Once approved, it's time to do two things: get yourself to the target area and find a job. This next chapter is the toughest part, particularly if in a small town. You need to keep a *very* low profile, quietly working and living outdoors. Get a bicycle and a tent that camouflages into the land. Stay well out of town in an unpopulated area. Keep working and paying your credit card. 

11. Look at houses. Google helps; research what to look for. Stick a pocket knife in the floor joists in the basement to see if they're solid. Look for newer hot water heaters and furnaces. Small houses are the best as they're the cheapest to improve. My house is ~700 sq ft; I pieced together a roof for about $1k and do it myself (YouTube is your friend). Yes, even with inflation you can do it. 

12. Once approved, make an offer. Google everything (that's what I did). It's a slog to get through the paperwork, but the lenders are highly motivated lately. I was given a $40 mortgage without any home inspection requirement, no appraisal, and the whole process took about 60 days, including making an offer. In small towns, there's less bullshit to deal with - small-town realtors seem to be driven to get it done quick, especially if it's a small sale like mine was.   

13. Hot tip: If you can double your efforts with a friend, do that. Hell, do it with three of you. All of your names can be on the house title, it's not hard to do. Take the one of you with the best credit and put it in his or her's name. Pool your cash and keep track of who spends what. Then, with a sub-$60k house, you'll be *splitting* a mortgage that is less than $500/mo two or three ways...

At day's end, my mortgage is $400/mo with all the taxes and insurance in escrow (meaning included in the monthly payment). My electric bill is, if I am smart, $20/mo. I use a flip phone I got on eBay for $20 and my monthly bill for it is $15. I use the library for internet and download music and movies to use at home. I installed a wood stove from Craigslist ($120) and heat my house with wood -- which I usually can find for free. I bought a $3000 beater pickup truck I can fix myself (with YouTube's help) and use it to get firewood. I go to Church to network with folks who offer me wood in exchange for picking up their yard or shoveling them out. (Even if you don't agree with going to Church, if you live in a rural area, I'm telling you, go anyway. Services are harmless and you WILL get access to all kinds of opportunities you wouldn't get sitting at home on a Sunday). I wash my laundry by hand right now but am working on building a bicycle-powered washer. I dry it on the line, which oddly enough works well even in winter. I grew 600 pounds of cabbage last year and turned it into sauerkraut. Grew 200 pounds of potatoes. I borrowed a 30-30 from a guy at Church and shot a deer that yielded me 150 pounds of meat. Also shot two turkeys and five rabbits. Now working on chickens for eggs and meat. Minimum wage take-home weekly pay in my state at 40 hours of work per week is about $400, which would leave you with another $1200 to pay for electric ($20), auto insurance ($80 here), food you can't grow or kill, and savings. I'm making more than this, and odds are decent you could get there too. 

I have helped two people IRL do exactly this. When I say it's doable, I'm not lying. Maybe you don't want to live in a small rural town, but I'm telling you, once you get into your own house and lock the door, you won't care where you are so long as you've got a yard to garden and there aren't bullets flying around your neighborhood. Maybe you don't like conservative backwoods folks but they WILL help you if you play the game they're playing even a tiny bit. My ""racist deplorable Trumper"" neighbors have helped me more than any agency in any city ever did. City poverty is a TRAP! Get away!

Also, do NOT be afraid of winter!!! A house in a freezing cold region with long dark cloudy winters and ten feet of snow is better than being homeless in Florida! Really! Do not let climate impact where you look at all. 

A variation on this can also be done with land if you're *really* resilient, and it takes a lot less to start it up. Find a town with no building codes and cheap land (try WV). You can usually get land loans on small parcels for 40% down. Say, a $10k 3-acre parcel, totally unimproved, can be bought for $4k down and 24 months of $274 payments at 9% interest (rates are way higher for land loans). As long as you have a truck and a minimum wage job, even with lower minimum wages, you can live. Sometimes, there are parcels for sale for less than $6k outright - look in forested regions with plenty of rainfall. You don't need more than an acre but it's good to have it if you can. Avoid the desert! Tons of cheap ways to build a livable cabin. Again, YouTube can teach you all sorts of things. I never had anyone teach me how to do the things I do, I just Googled it. Sink some concrete sleeves into 6' deep post holes and put 6"" diameter young, straight tree logs into them (preferably hardwood) and build a cabin frame onto those. Tarpaper is cheap and for a small place, so is tin. Insulate with wool moving blankets from Alibaba. Or search up straw bale construction. Get a big garden. Kill squirrels and rabbits and learn to skin and eat them. I'm dead serious I know guys who did it, went straight from sleeping under the West Side Highway in Manhattan to living like this in Kentucky. He sends me typewritten letters and says he works 20hrs a week at a truck stop and spends the rest of his time with his chickens writing poems and fixing his old F-150.

For me, the house worked. The military helped, but I now realize I could've done this even without the military. Saving $8k in a year isn't that hard if you don't pay rent, just work full time and preferably try to get to a state that pays a decent minimum wage (or work under the table somewhere). 

Anyway, hope I didn't piss anyone off with this post. If it's not for you that's ok, but again, if even ONE person reads this and comes to believe they can get there and goes and does it, it was worth it to share. God bless all of you.

We frequently have people that sit on our back step to chill, eat, smoke, do whatever they need to do and that has never bothered us. They usually just pass through and we don’t typically see the same people a lot. 

There was a large snowstorm that passed through our city and there has been a man sleeping by our back step since the storm. We are not used to people staying more than a couple nights, as I said they typically just pass through no problem. We’ve been cutting this guy some slack on his stay because it’s been freezing outside and it would be cruel to make him move when he’s found a comfortable and decently warm spot. 

When he first started sleeping here he would give a quick remark as we walked inside: “Happy New Year”, “Have a great day”, etc. As the days have progressed so have his remarks and today he asked if we had any dogs in the house (we don’t) and he said “What, no guardians?”. This is the first we’ve ever experienced this, people ask us for money and food and we give what we can but we’re also struggling in our 20s so there’s only so much we can help. 

We don’t want to call the cops on him and get him in trouble but his remarks are just starting to scare us a little. The snow is melting, would it be rude to ask him to find a different spot? What is the best way to go about doing that?",clockthecasba,83,1,3,1530

106cagz,"Homelessness is an obvious result of the systematic breakdown of the family unit. Cultures with strong family and community structures don't experience rampant homelessness issues.  Countries like America have cultural systems in place that encourage people to abandon their young children and elderly parents to the mercy of a cruel and cold capitalistic dystopian hellscape.

Most of the other gypsies and vagabonds I have met on the road (who have shared their tale) either escaped their family home because of violence or sexual abuse... or their family kicked them out of the house once they came of age.

Which seems to be a ""thing"" in America in particular.  Like, oh, your kid just finished high school, has no job or life experience, let's FORCE THEM TO LIVE ON THE STREET.  People hate raising their own children so much that they force them into destitution as soon as it's legally possible to do so.  It sucks.  I just see these situations so often here, I find it disheartening that folks feel ok about abandoning their own kids.  

Anyway, I'm an older dude, I have a kid in their 20's.  I make sure that she knows that as long as I have a house, SHE ALWAYS HAS A PLACE TO STAY.  Parents, stop kicking your kids out of the house when they come of age.  It's not helpful.  It just cripples your child's chance of having a successful future.",RabidusRex,52,1,8,1024

I can imagine that some of it would have to do with the time of day but other than that, you may have been terrified and had no idea what to do, where to go or who to reach out to for help. Especially if it was your first time.

I was homeless and also a vagabond for quite a few years and I'm still kind of living on the edge now but I always kept a ""just in case"" bookbag/backpack handy with things I might need in such a situation.

Depending on the time of day I found myself homeless, I might find a place to grab a coffee, look over a map and try to figure out where I wanted to go and what I hoped to do when I got there. Then, I'd hitch-hike, train-hop or whatever until I got where I wanted to be. If it was late at night, my first priority would be to find a safe place to sleep until the next day. If my clothes were raggedy and I needed a shower, I'd try to find a clothing pantry and a shelter where I could get a quick shower and a change of clothes and good walking shoes/boots. If it was freezing outside, I'd layer my clothes and do the ""turtle"" thing when sleeping. If I was really hungry, my first priority might be to hit up a restaurant, dumpster-dive or panhandle. So, it would all depend on the time of day and needs I had when I found myself homeless.

So, what were some of the first things you did when you found yourself homeless?. Try to find something to eat?. Hitch a ride, study a map (or GPS)?. Look for a place to sleep?. Call friends/family?.

I had no choice but to crash on my sister's couch for 3 months as I waited for college to start.

The depression came in waves of strength but it never went away. I kept my job the entire time and still have it. Hell I even had just got a promotion a few months back but I had to give that up under the pretense I was gonna get a transfer to a different city. I'm in Daytona Beach, and I was supposed to go to Orlando to be by family but all the variables stacked onto another left me with no money to save. Nor do they actually have any room for me as I was supposed to use the cash to find a room and now that's invalid

I have 5 days staying at a friend's house RN but I know I have to leave soon and after that I have no place to go. I'm still getting hours at work for the time being so when I do end up nowhere I can at least cover my storage for another month or two, but my question is this. I have some friends in Vegas who informed me if I can get a way there, they would have a couch for me. Everyone I've talked to says Florida is atrocious for homeless, and I see it here as well between the junkies and such. I don't do hard drugs nor do I drink, in fact I recently stopped smoking pot entirely to be alert and pass whatever drug test for shelters and such so I'm sober entirely RN.

Would I have a better chance in Vegas? I know I have a couch for a few weeks max as I wouldn't want to be a bother to them that long at all, I would just want to find work there or maybe even try to get a transfer of my current job so I can try to save up some money there, throw them some money for their kindness until I can get into like a transitional housing situation or something. I'm not sure what my options are and even though the desire to throw myself under a train isn't there anymore (took me years after mom and pops passed to not wanna die and join them and I'm still not ok entirely) I don't wanna just give up and fade away.

It's tough as nails to make friends these days or get into a good relationship and even tougher to maintain that friendship/relationship. I mean, you have to just bump into someone first and maybe get a convo going. If it goes well, you next have to have shared interests or things in common. You have to establish trust...a bond...spend days, weeks, years hanging out together and socializing and even then, there is no guarantee that a friendship/bond will form.

At some point, you find out that your new friend has a dark past, maybe violent tendancies or has an addiction problem. Maybe your new girlfriend/boyfriend gives you an STD and isn't honest about it up-front. Maybe the new person in your life has a family that hates your guts or the person just turns out to be really wierd or have some creepy fetish or whatever and you don't find out until you have already wasted a whole year just getting to know them.

Out on the streets it's even more difficult because a lot of folks are on high-alert for danger, in survival-mode and distrustful of others because thier safety and even lives can depend on it. Other people could care less about being your friend and just can't be bothered.

I know the following is true- that my past has a huge impact on the issues I face as an adult. That it can only be sorted out by a professional. But I can't see myself going to *anyone* and just telling my life story because it's so cringe to me. Yet other people dump this stuff on random people even all the time. 

Do people actually empathize when people start a convo or post with listing all the reasons they are especially disadvantaged? Because it makes me want to hurl and I also think they have a developmental delay or personality disorder. That's not what everyone really thinks tho? Because maybe it's because I have an extreme amount of shame for things like that and I'm projecting that towards these other people who express themselves this way. That is highly likely, BUT..

 I also know enough to know that in general people really don't give a fuck about other people if they're not somehow invested already. Like when someone lists off their problems instead of just addressing the main point I get kind of offended like it's awfully audacious of them to help themselves to my time or the assumption that I would automatically give a flying fuck. And the average person cares even less. So how does this behavior get reinforced even? Or does it even?

In a few days or even less I will be living behind my workplace.  I have been living with my family for a few years but my mother has bpd and is prone to outbursts.  Today she and I had an unprovoked argument and she’s threanting me with eviction.  I told her I would leave so she wouldn’t have to go through the process of filing an official eviction since it’s so expensive and I don’t want that on my record.  That wasn’t an acceptable response and if I don’t move out soon enough, though she never gave me a timeline, she said she would call the city police and tell them I assaulted her.  She’s getting older, has the beginnings of Alzheimer’s or dementia, and she has a mood disorder.  I don’t want to cause her anymore stress and my stepfather doesn’t want to get involved.

I was married with two kids in 2015. I had a stable job and I was working through a rough marriage. I knew my spouse had some manic depression/bipolar and I stood by him through the hardest times. We separated for a time, due to his drug and alcohol use and I went live with a family member for several months while we tried to work out our issues. He got a better job and sobered up a bit. I went back and we were pregnant with our third kid. The first week I found out I was pregnant, I lost my job. I found another job but it was so rough with two kids and being pregnant, I had to leave. My husband was living in a different state for a job and sending what money he could. Eventually he came back and we sofa hopped for a bit and I asked if we could try the local shelters. We went through the application process and we were accepted. We lived in a shelter for two months with two kids under age of five. 

We still had a vehicle, but payments were getting behind. My husband worked, as it was part of the shelter program we were in, and we eventually went to a transitional housing in 2015. Our son was born two months later and I took a small job while going back to school. We were doing well for awhile until my husband started using again in 2017. I wanted to leave the transition house and he became complacent. I eventually left and took three kids with me on my own.

It’s been a wild life. My oldest will be thirteen soon and she is the only one that remembers living in a homeless shelter. She will bring up memories here and there. She recently asked if she could work towards getting into an Ivy League College one day. I didn’t know what that was at her age. So, I sit back and humble myself a bit just thinking about where we have been in life. I’m grateful for the people that made my family a meal during those times and that we had a place to rest our heads at night.

i have a part time job and i make $1600/month. i will also be attending community college now to complete a CS degree (should be done in a year or so), so working more right now is impossible due to my mental and physical issues. i have ended up in the hospital attempting to do two full time jobs. i cannot get private loans because i don’t have a co-signer, so i can expect to get a grand or two each semester from fafsa. i can also get a bus pass through my school and access to a gym. i’m trying to sign up for food stamps but the process is difficult. i might be able to stay with a friend for a few nights but not long term, and i have no other financial supports.

I pay a minimum of $600 in credit card bills and therapy/medical bills (no longer spending credit ofc, i set up a payment plan with lower interest through some program. i will call and see if they can lower my monthly dues due to my situation). after that i’m left with $1100. so already i think i’m starting with a lot of options compared to some, but the issue lies in the cost of living here. rent is insane. even with roommates i’d be lucky to find something under what i have left, and then i would have zero dollars for emergency expenses, or utilities or anything. it doesn’t help that i don’t know how to network and find roommates or living situations. i’ve looked on craigslist and everything seems dangerous for a woman, and everything on facebook is seeking more middle class rents that i can’t afford. seems most opportunities are found by knowing people, which i do not. i also have a general fear of people and have difficulties making friends. 

it’s my weak understanding that transitional housing  can offer semi long term opportunities for some people and section 8 vouchers and stuff (which from my understanding can take years anyway). let’s say i was somehow eligible for this. do i live alone? with others? is it safe? how much will i pay? because until i graduate there’s no chance of making more money than i already am, and if i can graduate i can potentially make a living wage and help my family members escape too. so how can you transition from this housing to “normal” housing if you cannot afford it? and if i were to attempt to do this with family (two disabled adults) will that change things?

zyuc19,"Need advice So, for history we got evicted back in our old state and have been in our current one long enough to be residents. 

We took some bad advice to ‘wait for court to leave so he can’t claim you owe even more’ as the landlord we had at the time had tried many shady things already(even lied in court!) and now we are stuck with this on our record. 

Because of this, on top of being low income already, we are in a bind sleeping in a friends basement and paying them rent. 

We have no vehicle. Currently in the process of getting my license(old state wasn’t a great place to get it after the people who had custody of me as a child refused to let me get it while in hs). Kinda makes it harder since there isn’t a rule you can’t there but also you technically have to lie to do so because the paperwork is made for teenagers and teenagers only. Anyway here it isn’t and I can exist and get it, however friends hubby decided ‘until you find a place’ and doing a short term agreement to revisit later is now ‘be out by February’. 

We cannot find a rental. We’ve spent months applying. In the aftermath of what happened it turns out better halves credit dropped off from 688 to ‘no credit’ so apparently that also dings us too. Obviously we are on that but I cannot do much about it before time. It dropped off without warning while we’ve been dealing with this situation. 

I’m disabled, on a walker, keep getting denied for assistance so got someone who does that for a living to help from over by the homeless shelter. Kiddo is on the spectrum. We aren’t on disability, either one of us. We only managed to get kiddo seen after we moved so the diagnosis is recent for kiddo but for me I was told they’d owe me too much back pay so wouldn’t do so. I try to find jobs anyway but so far they see physical and realize I’ve a ptsd on top of that and naada. That’s if the walker alone don’t scare them off. I’ll be the only one able to drive when I get my license due to better half having his own medical issues.

We aren’t legally married but we’ve been together a long time. 

I’m doing my best to plan but we cannot even qualify for a small loan to help get a vehicle sooner rather than later and even then we’ll probably be camping and sleeping in Walmart parking lots a lot. What we managed to bring with us? We’re losing even more and we lost nearly everything in the first place.

Have applied for lists and had eyes on housing assist lists but we keep running into lists being closed or only for people who are chronically homeless, and since we’ve been doing our best not to be homeless all along we’ve managed to avoid it until recently.

I don’t know what to do or where to turn. Every door is closed and every window empty. No matter what I do out ends up feeling so stupidly hopeless. Like all we did was delay it. 

I need to know somewhere concrete to turn or something we can do. Anything. At current time all I can think of is that we’ll be sleeping in a Walmart parking lot even if we can get a car. I’ve marked items to help shower and have a means to cook food etc, but I’ve not been camping since I was seven or eight years old and I refuse to have my family in the situation I was when homeless at barely legal age.

I need solutions, things to do, places to turn that won’t turn us away. 

I’ve called 211, gone through various housing searches and even obscure ones you really only hear about through them or some sort of service that deals with them otherwise. I’ve searched hud and I’ve endured near countless disappointment for months while doing searching. (Section 8 is closed but the lists are still viable so used the housing list and checked lists). 

I have been endured all manner of attitude so my family doesn’t have to. Some people ate compassionate. Some of them will insist there is some service you’ve yet found or simply not bothered with. They can’t tell you what that is but they are convinced it must exist. Some have told me people needing help are simply lazy or that it is our fault bc better halves job doesn’t pay more so we can just buy a house.

I need methods. I need ideas. Just someone please tell me there is something I’ve not tried yet. Something. And if not some method my family survives this together somehow with needs met even if only just until we can figure something out. 

If there is something I’ve missed someone please direct me to it.

I had very little money so I went to Walmart, picked out some meager food items to eat and yes, made the decision to put a $28 sleeping bag in my cart I couldn't afford to pay for. I didn't choose the most expensive one by any means, just the minimum I thought it would take to keep warm. 

I went through self checkout scanning everything but the sleeping bag, calmly put the food and the bag into my cart and was waived right past the greeter, receipt in hand. About 5 seconds later, I hear the greeter from about 20 ft. behind me start saying ""Sir! SIR!"". I kept walking not even pausing to look, after all, I was waived through and was now out of the store. I then abruptly heard a male voice yelling "" Hey! YOU!"" Still I kept calmly walking pushing my cart down an aisle of parked vehicles. I was praying that was it and as I parked the cart at the curb and began to take out the items to start walking off property,  I hear again from much closer, a bunch of heavy footsteps, and see 4 large males surrounding me. I began to walk with my items away from then but then before I knew it one of em shouted ""Fuck him up!"". One got me in a police style chokehold from behind cutting off my windpipe and the others took shots at my face before I hit the ground, with the chokehold still applied to my neck. I was about to lose consciousness when the guy finally let go. They took the sleeping bag back inside, left my food and told me to never come back. 

I picked up my food and walked back to where I knew people and everyone was shocked. My face was bloody and swollen and it was apparent I was on the business end of a gang style beat down. I called the police to make a report, the cops came, one of them drove over to Walmart to "" investigate "" and came back with the story it was just 4 random guys that did this and NOT Walmart security.

zwx6hm,"Anyone familiar with RV's? Questions for Mechanics, Plumbers, RV specialists, and even electronics. Just not sure where to start, my RV is so old I can't really find matching advice/documentation on how to deal with it, some of my questions are basic, some are more technical.  I just don't learn well reading alone, I have to at bare minimum ask questions.  I hope someone here can chime in some advice.

1. RV toilets, people have explained how they work in basic sense, but not enough to tell me how to use it and test if it's working.  Things like, how do I put water into it?  Do I have to use the water tank, or can I manually fill it for only emergencies?  Where's the water tank normally at?  How do I test the lines?  How do I make sure it ""Works"" before ""Soiling"" it?  I at least know where the blackwater drain is, and have a rough idea of the water tanks, but I really don't want to use them.  My goal is to only use in emergencies (Mornings for me, and if I can't get to a regular bathroom) and thus fill it on an as needed basis, then clean on every use to ensure it's clean to my standards.
2. Electrical, this is an older truck outfitted with a single solar panel, all wiring is gone, except the panel to the deep cycle RV battery.  I'm familiar enough with how to use it, using an inverter, however is there a way to calculate the usage, or how long that battery should last on it's own, no incoming power?  I'll be using the solar, but it's old enough it won't be efficient.
3. I'd also like to conserve electricity, so secondary question on electrical, more about saving.  Any advice on jimmy rig but safe fires, cheap/diy candles and heaters with fire are greatly appreciated, It's tiny, so definitely no fireplace.  I'll get candles if I can, but otherwise I'm completely out of money ensuring it works properly and drives.  Should be plenty of ventilation, but I would like to avoid smoky wood fires however I'll take any advice, it's cold out there.
4. I know my way around electronics, but I don't know every single piece, I've only mainly dealt with networking and small electronics repair.  Is there an easy, but safe way, to wire up the main battery and alternator to the deep cycle, and allow it to also charge off the alternator when running?  This would allow me to use the heat from the engine, and keep the battery charged.  Only problem is funds, I have old stereo wiring perfect for this higher voltage (2ga and 0ga) I can strip from my old cars, and eventually will sell one for scrap metal prices.  Any advice here, even cheap equipment to buy over long term is appreciated.

I can't think of anything else for this post, so I leave it here, and do appreciate any additional information or knowledge anyone thinks may be important or useful.

Edit:  To add, I re-watched a few videos about RV basics, but my issue is I need ELI5 there.  They say fill the toilet, where?  How?  Is there a back tank to fill it?  A side tank?  Do I use a pump?  Do I pour water in the back like in a home?  Directly in the bowl?",Sickologyy,5,1,11,964

zwqx40,"People who use the homeless to get social media views There's a guy I keep running across on my Facebook page who posts numerous videos of him helping homeless people. He'll walk up to them, ask them what they need, and he'll give it to them, along with some extra money. Of course the homeless person is very grateful (I would be too) and of course hundreds of people post replies about what an awesome guy he is. 
Now please don't get me wrong...I totally believe in helping the homeless whenever you can, but I also just hate the fact that people like this seem to be using the plight of the homeless to garner praise on social media. I don't understand why he can't just do it without filming it and why every good deed has to be put on blast.
Another video I saw the other day really upset me. It was of this guy who had bought a breakfast meal for a homeless gentleman at a Macdonald's, and the staff I guess told him the homeless guy couldn't eat it at the restaurant because there had been complaints of him harassing customers. That happened to me one time...I bought a meal for a homeless woman and the staff told me she wasn't allowed to eat there, so I took the homeless woman to a park and sat and talked with her while she ate. Yet instead of doing that, this kid whips out his phone and proceeds to yell at the staff and law enforcement on video telling them that they are heartless bastards and how dare they not allow him to eat there. It was as if he was trying to be the hero by sticking up for this ""poor homeless man"" and being some sort of justice warrior. It just seemed to me he was using the situation and the homeless man to look like he a hero on social media.
Like I said I totally believe in helping the homeless but there's a way to do it, and I certainly don't think you should be doing it for social media fame. To me that's so wrong and I see it as using the plight of the homeless for your own glory. 
Am I way off kilter here? I also remember one time a homeless guy was kicked out of a restaurant close to me for no obvious reason than he was homeless, but come to find out, he was a predator who had been caught pleasuring himself under the table with kids there.

zwpbwf,"I helped a homeless friend a few years ago and now that I'm homeless and she's doing okay she doesn't seem to care I'm currently sleeping on a couch on a friend's porch. Because I don't have a room in his home I consider myself and my 2 cats homeless. Due to some bad investments, and trusting my father who ended up lying to me, I lost my home and am now starting over. A huge part of me is very grateful that I at least have a place to sleep and shower, it still gets very cold at night and very discouraging not having a home if my own and it's getting to the point where I feel like I'll never have another home. 

I have a friend who lives a couple hours from me. A few yrs ago she got evicted from her apartment and landed on the streets. I took her into my home and tried to offer her shelter but she was a junkie at the time and I eventually took her to rehab, but she ended up on the streets anyhow. I found a home for her dog and allowed her to store her stuff at my place. 
She pretty much cut herself off and I lost touch with her for several years until a few months ago. It was at this time that I started having problems and through an unfortunate series of events became homeless. I'm trying to work myself out of it but it's hard.
Let me just say she has not been as good a friend and support that I would have hoped. The last time I tried to confide in her about how hopeless I was becoming she basically told me that I needed to quit having a pity party and that God doesn't always want us to be comfortable and how there's something in my life that I'm not fully surrendering to him and that's why I'm in this predicament. She said that she was only telling these things because she ""loves me and is being truthful with me.""
The thing that really bothers me is that when she was down on her luck I did everything I could to help her. I picked her up from the hospital several times because she was going through withdrawals. I even kept her from killing herself when she took a knife and tried to slit her wrists in front of me. I literally held her down until the cops came. I did a lot for her and really tried to help her, and now that she's off the streets and doing well, she's too involved with her fiance and ""ministry"" to help me or even give me any encouragement.
Of all the people who would have some compassion I figured that she would, especially since she used to be in my shoes. But apparently she's too good for that now. I've pretty much given up on even talking to her. I never judged her when she was in my shoes.",CaliCloudburst,110,5,3,1530

A stranger online ended up catching wind via one of my posts in a town reddit I'm in hat I'm homeless. They kindly reached out and offered to let me live in their trailer temporarily.
We decided to meet up for coffee for both our own comfort,and we seemed to click. Our original plan was that'd I'd get picked up by them today.
The thing is though, my anxiety has been blaring about all this since yesterday.
They don't seem at all suspicious, and what they told me about themself seemed legitimate enough, but I'm going to be living with a complete stranger. And they don't really live in my town, as they're from a small township 45 minutes away from town.
I know it's very common for people to move in with strangers when looking for places with pre established roommates and stuff, but even if i wasn't homeless, doing something like this makes me feel super nervous.
So i guess what I'm asking is, should i take this kind stranger's offer? And if so, what can I do to protect myself for the short time in there?
And also, have you guys ever stayed with a stranger that doesn't know you? If yes, what has that been like for you?
Any advice would be appreciated.

I never had a good relationship with my mom, and my dad has been out of the picture ever since I was 4. When I was 18 my mom said she didn’t have room for me and I was forced to live with my grandparents. My grandparents didn’t like me and it just made me uncomfortable living there and made me suicidal. I explained to my mom that I was suicidal and I just got the “you’re depressed? I’m depressed. You don’t know what depression is” talk. My mom never cared about my mental health even though I was showing signs of extreme depression at the ripe age of 12. After living with my grandparents for 2 years I met a girl, she was so kind to me, and offered me to live with her. I moved in with her after dating for 2 months because I thought I would be happier with her than with my grandparents, and I was for a little bit. But over time she just became so overwhelming and I didn’t know how to help her. After about 10 months with her I became extremely depressed and tried to kill myself. I was admitted to the mental hospital and they diagnosed me with a personality disorder. I went to visit my mom after I had been released and showed her what I had been diagnosed with and she just brushed it off and told me my disorder was a mindset. I told her about my disorder in hopes that she would try and figure out ways to communicate with me without me feeling like a victim. After a while, I realized that my girlfriend and I were not compatible after a year of being together. I explained to my mom that I wanted to break up with my girlfriend and move in with her again, and she said it was totally fine. I break up with my girlfriend and pack my bags to move in with my mom. After driving 2 hours with everything I own in my car my mom tells me she doesn’t want me around, that I’m crazy, that I would just make Christmas worse. She wants nothing to do with me. She says I just blame her for everything that goes wrong in my life which is not the case at all. But she refuses to try to understand me. She told me I’m not a daughter to her and that she doesn’t want me corrupting my brothers or her “kids” because I’m a bad influence.

While I don't personally run any of the rescues, I've had to be extremely creative and network intensely to bring in volunteers to help. I was talking about (honestly as a joke first) starting my own rescue, bringing homeless individuals to take care of the dogs (really not that hard of work) in exchange for some sort of living/Food arrangements on the same land. The rescue world is very expensive, and demands a lot of outside charitable donations, so simply paying them like a normal job wouldn't be very manageable. From some reading around, I've noticed the consensus is that a lot of homeless people are not interested in working, due to many reasons, but I'd imagine SOME would love the opportunity to get into a place with a roof (even if it's just a shed) with some food in exchange for a few hours of work a day.

Last time she placed an order at a store near him for him to pick up. When she contacted the store to be sure he picked everything up okay, she was told he's in very rough shape, clearly using heavy drugs, and stole several items from the store after picking up the order. The store manager didnt call police because she felt bad but said she wont allow him back in (understandable). 
This type of situation isnt unusual for him. My mom worries so much about him shoplifting (he's been in jail a few times now) that's she taken to sending him more money more often.
I'm fairly certain that he shop lifts because he uses the money for his drugs, but also understand he's going to use either way. 
With that in mind, is sending the money helping him?? Is it at least allowing him to have the *opportunity* to buy necessities? Beyond that, theres a small chance I'm wrong, and he really does use the money for things he needs (I suppose the argument could also be made that at this point, he probably does need the drugs to survive as well).
I dont know. I'm just very out of my depth here. As I said, I dont mind sending money, but I worry it's doing more harm than good. Any thoughts or insights would be much appreciated

I also tried to take a couple homeless guys to see a movie but they didn’t show up the next day when I went to meet them. I was going to drop them off, buy their tickets and some popcorn, and then let them watch the movie together. Then after I drove around looking for them and couldn’t find them, someone told me that was stupid because they could have hurt me. 

What are some options I have? Here are my thoughts/ideas if someone could set me straight. Thank you in advance

I realized I had some clothes I wasn’t using or that I grew out of. I intended to give some to my boyfriend’s kids but one of them is too young for my size and the other is already larger than I am. I have stuff like a couple warm puffy jackets, some sweaters, and other random clothes. I’m 140 lb female, so my clothes are pretty small and probably wouldn’t be much help to some so I feel a little silly considering it and don’t want to come off as rude if I don’t have clothes to fit them.

I also have some stuff like unused disposable razors and shaving cream that I was using for my dad when I was taking care of him before he died. I was thinking of buying some toothpaste and toothbrushes, some deodorant wipes, maybe baby wipes, idk. 

Then I thought that I would like to give away some food, too. Maybe fruit snacks, chips, granola bars, small stuff that won’t go bad right away.

I don’t know if it’s safe to walk up to someone because I don’t want to offend them and I don’t want to get yelled at or stalked which has happened in the past. I considered wrapping some shoe boxes full of useful stuff and leaving them for someone to find. But I want to make sure they don’t get missed and blown away or tossed, I want them to go to people who really need them.

Later in the day, while I was at one of the community activities, I got pulled out by a shelter staff member and taken to the front desk. The staff member behind the desk started lecturing me and giving me attitude and sass that I wasn't going to be allowed to go to community events like that since I canceled my therapy appointment. Then, they told me they literally got on the phone with the doctor's office and told them I was still going to the appointment and then they forced me to go.

Writing about it it doesn't sound real but that literally happened to me. I had a flashback while I was doing something else just now so I wanted to write about it.

zt2qhf,"Some insight into what helped me survive homelessness I was homeless for three years while I was in the depths of a prolonged psychotic break. My journey started in Syracuse, NY, but because I thought the CIA was brainwashing me, I would travel to Portland, OR and then Miami, FL with barely a dollar to my name. Suffered a lot being so detached from reality as I was, but at the same time I have to say that those three years were not only the best thing for me, but they were also some of the best years of my life thus far. I want to share some of my insights as to why this is, so that you might lessen your suffering while living without a place to rest your head that you can call your own.


First off, you gotta have a mission; something you can immerse yourself in to do meaningful things and whittle away at the long hours out of doors. A person without a mission is just sitting around waiting to die. If you are invested in something greater than yourself, you will find the strength to keep putting one foot in front of the other. Definitely assuages the pain of depression and addiction and apathy.


Because I was mad during this period of my life, I always felt like I had something I had to do. Usually this involved picking up trash or exercising or writing or doing performance art, but as everyday was its own self-contained episode of synchronous hijinks, I would frequently try new things. That is another key point I want to make; break as many patterns of behavior and other habits that make your life feel comfortable. Not only is this critical in the healing process as it is the primary means to recondition yourself out of the old you, but when each day is filled with novelty, that greatly decreases the agony of feeling trapped in a prison of unending negativity. It just makes life feel like it's worth living to the fullest, which brings us to my next point.


You have to have some connection to a higher power. Now, as insane as I've been, I am still a highly rational person. I don't believe in traditional depictions of God, which is fine because you don't need to in order to receive strength from your faith. If you do find peace in normative versions of the divine, more power to you, but I find the same bliss in my belief that there is a functional alien hivemind guiding humanity. It's strange, but it works. It gives me a worldview where everything is working as intended and that I have a role to play in the big picture. Truly, you need to find something that gives you a purpose and the willpower to be the best version of yourself that you can be.


That said, I've found that living a life dedicated to kindness, compassion, and selfless service grants a profound sense of happiness in your life. When you put a smile on someone's face, suddenly your suffering becomes smaller. When you know that you're an agent of love and light, you can shrug off the little things easier, as you will see yourself as more valuable, which in turn boosts your outlook on everything.


Finally, I want to return to something I've already touched on. Your spiritual work is vital to your success and well-being. For reference, I consider spiritual work to be the things you do to better yourself and evolve your framework so you have the best perspective that you can muster. I've felt lost and hopeless before, but with much effort I improved my position in life and climbed out of such dark pits. You know what kicked off that transformation? I taught myself to juggle. It was the perfect activity for me to sink my time into and helped create opportunities moving forward. You have to find something that inspires you to work and work hard. Do what you love, and have faith that it is worth it to keep on with your self-improvement. 


That's all I have to share at this juncture in time. No, I lied. One last parting of words before I go. Being in the types of positions that lead to homelessness often results in feeling unloved and unwanted. So, I hope that I can help you see that you are in fact loved. If you don't get told it that often, let me tell you that I love you, cousin. I may not know you, but I care about you, and I'm not the only one. Across my bizarre journey, I've met a plethora of people that are full of love. Likewise, I've found that I can find them by spreading love as much as I can. You never know who someone is before they open themselves up, but you should believe that you are worthy of all the love in the world. Keep up with what I mentioned in this post and you'll find that you'll feel the abundance of good vibes present in the garden. Best wishes, friends. May fortune smile upon you.",Afoolfortheeons,55,1,12,1488

zsls8a,"My friendly town magician also woke up homeless on Christmas Day There is a magician in my town who is 50 who ever since I would be in downtown more and be around the junior college in the early 2010s after I graduated from HS, would be often seen walking around the jc library and just general downtown. I was sure he was carless but wasn’t sold from that alone that he was homeless. 

He usually looks well dressed in suits and dress shirts and is  clean and he performs magic tricks downtown, sometimes the “ball behind your ear” trick and in live shows he does the sawing a woman trick, etc. He isn’t bad, not the best but he does shows around the North Bay Area of Northern California and sometimes if lucky San Francisco. 

In 2013 a murder happened where two homeless men, one only 22, had a fight escalating into a brutal stabbing. The 22 year old died, and this was on Christmas night, and the murder happened over really nothing (sus thought victim was previous robber and came up to him apparently angrily). 

The magician heard the screams and it was on a court report he was homeless and slept behind a library stairwell… on Christmas Eve. And had to hear a horrific murder. The magician was a little over 40 at the time. 

Imagine that. Maybe he’s done something bad before but he seems like a very nerdy, quirky guy who can make you laugh. He finally got a job at Home Depot as a cashier thank god. 

But imagine your town magician who also is jolly and happy performing at elementary schools; kids sometimes send their teacher or whoever letters about the magician or addressed to him because they valued his shows. This guy that the local news covered on just a month or two prior to his homeless stints, praising his acts and looking forward to another show. 

No, he still ended up on a cold Northern California street in a sleeping bag. Who were the friends of his on Facebook and his magic show assistants. Not blaming them, maybe they were full on Christmas Eve. No help for a hotel?

Christmas may be another day for many but still. Wow this is awful. Glad he made out of it at least and he apparently has a room, no car

zs9gn7,"seeking feedback on a resource concept Location: semi rural South NJ, USA

I live and work in a county with total population around 150k. Point in Time homeless count was 82 last year (up from a consistent 30-35 pre-covid). Many are chronically homeless. 

Code blue here is about 10 years established, with waning volunteer pools. Two local churches offer showers.  Several with once a week feeding. One with daily lunch.  There are limited to no spaces for daytime services/support in the area. (Counting sympathetic librarians and VOA). Our one shelter is remote and is a bad fit for most of our chronically homeless. 

My concept idea: The Day Center, a place to be.

What it is: A membership based home- like environment with access to a kitchen,  showers,  laundry and community closet/commissary, personal storage, a living room with television and games,  and a ""quiet enjoyment library"" with reading materials wherein people would be free to nod off as they ""read"". The building I have in mind is situated within a block of our local Social security office, county jail, Courthouse, and administrative buildings.  

How it works: monthly sliding scale""memberships"", and additional day passes with acceptance of shared use guidelines,  including commitments to non aggression,  quiet enjoyment, and cleanliness. No other requirements for entry. Membership may be revoked or suspended for intentional violence or disruption, but may also be reinstated at a later time. Sponsorships would be encouraged to maintain membership for known chronically homeless neighbors.  

Open 7am to 7pm. Due to limited capacity (roughly 20 at a time), individuals would enter on timed passes with each check in OR First in, first out as patrons arrive through the day after reaching capacity.  Weapons and intoxicating substances left at the coat check along with health screening.  Showers encouraged at entry, potentially required if one is especially soiled. Other services may include: appointment and recertification reminders, referral to social service agencies, arranging transportation. No on-site social services or requirement of engagement with such. Agency partners may come in to promote or screen for services from time to time.

Staffed by volunteer and paid stewards, possibly members elected to these positions. These would be active accountable persons with the ability to assist individuals in accessing their belongings in storage or using facilities.  May need to regulate entry, exit, and activity within facilities. On the whole members would be given vote or influence in house rules and activities.  This makes for an opportunity to build an intentional community over another social service entity. 



My questions: 

Would you utilize a space like this? How often?

What is a reasonable rate of general affordability? Hourly? Daily? Monthly? 

What concerns or considerations would you have?



I'm also asking local unhoused friends their ideas on the concept, but most have had no interaction with a day shelter model, because most have only been homeless here.

He was playing games with the landlord and stopped paying and was avoiding contact with him and our family.

Recently he finally got kicked out of there before the matters got taken to court and has been trying to live at homeless shelters but gets kicked out of them because he can’t follow there rules. 

The past 5 days he ended up faking his sickness to stay 5 nights at the hospital just so he can have a place to stay and doesn’t realize that it costs so much money to spend even 1 night at a hospital.

Please keep in mind that he is delusional, he has mental illness and believes in God to an extent that shouldn’t be believed in. (Cult like religious beliefs ever since he got out of prison)

I only met this neighbor in passing for maybe a minute or two (I often walk a couple times a day, usually not much further than two miles due to health issues).

Anyhow, our conversation was short, but seemed enjoyable and both of us headed in different directions. I asked what was needed and where I could leave the supplies and the person was fairly excited about the exchange and instructed me on where to drop them off at.

Eventually, once I got rested enough I got back out and did so hours later, but so far they’ve not been touched.

I’ve only got a name/nickname to go by and have checked local arrest records just incase since, this person did mention squatting and avoiding the shelters, which I understand.

zqyhho," Happy Holidays Everyone ❤️🎄
 (ik it may not be cheerful for some) 

I was Homeless in 2017&18 when I was only 17yrs old living in New England Winters etc. It was Horrible. 

Now that I'm 22 and no longer Homeless I would like to give back. 
Unfortunately I am Not wealthy like these Youtubers. I cannot give away hundreds of dollars nor feed hundreds of families...BUT


I can buy supplies (actually already did) and create homemade holiday cards for the Homeless Community Around My City❤️❤️



I'm making this post because if you could spare just a few seconds of your day to write a short comment that I can write in one of my cards for them ❤️

Just Imagine you were without any friends, loved ones, or even a phone to visit reddit groups and meet mutual.
 Some genuinely are alone with nothing but their bodies and minds this holiday season. The least we can do as a community is offer a few loving words of encouragement❤️❤️ Maybe give them a smile that they very much needed this holiday season. 


Any comment you write I'll make sure to put into a personalized hand written and decorated card.


 Will be passing these cards out tomorrow in about 24 hours (4pm EST)",Main-Ad-5922,7,2,8,1024

zqtadx,"Deadly weather in the midsouth this weekend this Friday, in the mid south US, there's a brutal cold coming in. the temp will drop to 7 degrees. now I know some of you out there may be like ""it gets much colder than that where I live."" and you may be right. but the temp itself isnt the issue. at 12:30 am Thursday night (or Friday morning depending on your point of view since it is after midnight) the temperature will be in the mid 50s where I am currently. and by 3:30am, just 3 hours later, it's going to rapidly drop to the single digits. the human body has an amazing ability to adapt to extreme temperatures, so while you won't enjoy it, it's certainly possible to survive these conditions. but the problem is the speed of the change offers no chance to adapt. Combined with a -10 wind chill, this is deadly weather if you're outdoors. if you are currently in the east/midsouth us, take care to take all the precautions you can so you don't end up a corpsesicle by morning. make sure you have a warm bedding and stay off the ground. if you don't have something between your body and the ground you might just die. if I have funds to rent a hotel for a few nights, maybe consider it.  I don't so wish me luck lol. and most importantly, if you are shivering violently and freezing, but suddenly get warm and very sleepy, DO NOT go to sleep. you won't wake up if you do. do whatever you can to stay warm this weekend. if you're further north, I dont know the weather conditions, but you're probably already cold. hopefully you aren't also expecting a rapid drop in temp from what's probably alelready near or at single digits anyway, but if you are, this applies even more to you. remember, very low temperatures are extremely dangerous to those of us exposed to them, but a sudden huge drop in temp is far more dangerous as you have no change to get used to it. stay safe out there.",Vagabond2805,33,1,0,144

I’ve been sleeping in my SUV. On the side of this road near a park; it’s usually pretty quiet and there are other folks doing the same thing there.

Last friday, while i was laying in the back of my car, a drunk(on drugs?) driver ran into my car and totaled it. He hit me so hard that it moved my car into the guys van in front of me(also homeless), which fucked up his van supremely as well. His might be totaled too. For both of us, that’s all we had. Our livelihood. That wasn’t just our car it was our home too. I have so much shit in there that I can’t get out, because even if I did i’d have nowhere to put it. I’m lucky that I wasn’t killed and made it out with only a minor bruise but that shit was crazy and I can’t stop thinking about it.

I started my new job that I had lined up today, but it’s so much harder now. I don’t have my car and only a fraction of my belongings in a small backpack and I can’t stay in motels forever. I’m still not sure what I’m gonna do. I worked so fucking hard to get this job(it pays decent), and right before i’m finally supposed to start this happens to me. 

I want so badly to go fuck that guy up. The motherfucker was so fucked up on whatever he was on he couldn’t even speak a single sentence straight. And this fucking cunt was driving and ran into me. Then had the audacity to get out and start saying slurs to me. I’ve done fucked up shit in my life. I wouldn’t lose sleep if i found him and beat his kneecaps into shards. The cops let me take a picture of his ID so i have his address. He’s probably still in jail now, but i want SO BADLY to go fuck that guy up. I’m trying to remind myself that I need to be forgiving and be a good person even though he’s not. It’s hard.

Things went horribly wrong for a number of reasons and I lost everything and ended up homeless.  The hows and why are complicated and another story, but it needs included that I have severe mental problems with a history of alcoholism and drug abuse, with the final blow being several felony charges.  I bounced around between rehabs, psych wards, halfway houses a long term homeless shelter and finally starting about 17 months ago transitional housing.  A year ago after being turned down for many jobs because of my record which on top of being felonies makes it obvious I have addiction issues, I landed a job back in my field, they made me do grunt work general labor for 3 months to prove myself before getting me on a machine (I'm a CNC machinist) I was buried in debt that was all in collections from maxing out a lot of credit cards at the end largely on lawyers and trying to hold on after I lost my job do to the legal issues my credit was destroyed as well.  I've managed to pay off the majority of the debt and got my credit score up high enough that I was approved for an apartment with a large deposit.  I'm pretty much wiped out because of the deposit and first month rent, but I'll recover in a few months, I know how to live cheap to get money back in my account. I move in 3 weeks to a pretty nice normal apartment very close to my work in a much better neighborhood then I've been in most of the last 3 years.

Some people delete their post because they think its embarrassing or a bad reason for being homeless. And that's fine. But I think it is good to share your story, long or short, if you can for many good reasons, and for the greater good of all.

For me, its for many reasons, and for many times on and off.

I cant work or live a 9 to 5 life for politicians and other things that I don't like or support, its usually because of a moral issue about what these things are (predators, exploiters, corrupt, etc) even though I do love working 24/7. This issue is the same for income tax, as it is robbery and tyranny so I try to avoid it as much as possible. So instead, I work odd jobs for money, or just work for myself and others for free, usually all under the table. And so I am without money for long periods of time.

Additionally I like travelling and living free. Since a child I've always traveled freely. Going to and hanging out in different places in and out of town/city. As I grew up I expanded to different cities, then states. But I've never been out of my country (america is surrounded by only 2 other country and water so I cant just walk or hitchhike outside easily).


Once on the run. I was on the run once and that was the longest I was homeless (6 months). It was also the toughest because I couldn't just do whatever.

Those are my main reasons for being homeless on and off my whole life. But Iv never had a drug problem or hardcore mental illness problem (except being against the 9 to 5 life working for politicians and such, which is considered a mental illness by those things and their so called experts). I assume, because I don't have a drug problem or other hardcore mental illness, that's probably why I can stop being homeless somewhat easily when I want to.

This question is partially to find out why some people stay homeless for so long. Especially if they don't have a drug or mental illness problem. Is it a choice, unfortunate events, some other problem?",dadadies,37,1,3,1530

The last couple times we thought we found a place, horrible things happened. We lost thousands of dollars on a camper that ended up having a hidden mold problem- hospitalizing us both. We found a small apartment that we never got to stay a single night in because we got robbed immediately and had our car vandalized. We found another house and the landlord would only accept money orders for rent. After we put rent/deposit/pet fee onto three separate money orders as requested, he decided to not rent the house. Since we had filled them out already, we had a hard time cashing them out and it ended up taking almost a month to get our cash back.

Things are looking up, but now I'm scared. I won't be comfortable with it until everything is in writing and signed and paid and I'm sleeping in my own bed. I'm so terrified of getting my hopes up and having something stupid happen yet again. I'm tired of being cold, I'm tired of sleeping in uncomfortable car seats, I'm tired of worrying about a cop beating on my windows with a flashlight and demanding I leave, or someone robbing me.

This type of cold will bite down to the bones. Anyone dealing with the elements should do everything they can think of to get ready for this. Sock caps, layers of clothing really do help your body stay warm during extreme weather. Trying to find some decent shelter somewhere should be a priority.

zn0x4u,"First Time Every Being Homeless My doctor recently stopped prescribing my medicine which led to me having to take a leave of absence from work and ended up losing my place to live. I spent the first week in a hotel but I knew I would run out of money if I stayed there so I came to the local shelter. The staff is amazing, super friendly and willing to help. They are working on getting me into a doctor and they have a program to assist you in getting a job and an apartment. My boss is holding my job for me until I get this situation sorted out, so I have that hurdle covered.

I want to say that I now realize how hard it is for people to overcome homelessness. I knew it had to be tough but you don't know how hard until you experience it. Many of the people here have full time jobs but housing is so expensive in this town that they are forced to stay here at the shelter. 

I've also heard horror stories about shelters, but I must say this one is very clean and the other people here for the most part get along very well. I'm not saying there is not any drama, occasionally people will argue, but that is most likely due to the fact that there are so many people here, all undergoing the stress of being homeless, it can take a toll on person. Once I'm back on my feet I plan on volunteering at a homeless outreach program and maybe make a difference in someone's life, I know they are working to make difference in mine.",No-Emergency3374,66,1,11,964
zn0cuu,"Thinking about starting a weekly meditation practice w/ mainly homeless people in mind. Thinking of billing it as mental health, cause ""enlightenment"" is a strange word. Avoiding overdosing -by way of carbs, sugar, coffee, shopping, daydreaming, or any type of escapism- is what it helps us avoid. Using a substance or state of mind to the point of overdosing on it is my definition of drugs. Overdosing doesn't mean physical death, necessarily, it's in the word itself: to much dosage, of whatever it may be. Anything can be medicine in the right amounts, even escapism, daydreaming, etc.  


Anyway, I'm writing this post just to put the idea out there for others, cause who knows if I'll actually ever organize it? I've shopped the idea around to a few people I know to mixed results. I've got one enthusiast so far.

I spoke with a few people in my area, and some personal requests were puzzle books, pencils, led for pencils, drawing pads, light weight books, shoe laces, emergency blankets, socks (almost everyone), bookbags, chap stick, moisturizers, blankets (Almost everyone), small towels, and umbrellas.

My target goal is 24 people and under 1000. At the moment I'm at $844. I am in South Carolina. Here is what I planned so far for each kit:

Should I get travel tooth brushes and travel tooth paste? How about deodorant, if so, what type? Water bottles, suggestions?

zll8hl,"I feel like a total fuck up and I'm sick of it. I'm sick if feeling like s total failure. No matter what I do i always end up back on the streets. I've been living on and off full time homeless since about 2008-2009. My husband and i recently had a great place to call home with 4 walls and a door we could lock but shit went south and we had to bounce so back to the streets. While we were there we acquired a pregnant Female pitbull named Precious she had 12 puppies her and I did the whole puppy thing, that was hard as fuck and there was lost of sweat and tears shed yada yada yada. We kept one of the puppies Buddy Jr. He is now 1.5. 
 Shit went south and we ended up back on the streets. Precious and Buddy absolutely love it out here in the riverbottom. It was summer when we hit the streets so of course we went to our summer home under the bridge. We acquired an old and kinda run down RV as a gift and we moved it out into the desert surrounding the bridge after summer was gone. The past 6 months I have been working full time at FedEx and I'm not home alot. My husband also has his own thing he's got going so he's also gone alot as well. We learned that it's damn near impossible keeping precious and Buddy inside the RV when we are gone and they developed a habit of roaming. Well i have been tirelessly trying to find a way to get precious spayed for the last year and a half. I haven't been able to find a legit low cost clinic that is any less than $300 after all is said and done and living paycheck to paycheck that's just not feasible. Buddy is also unaltered and guess what happened???? Yup she's pregnant!!!!!! I told my husband after her last heat that i was near positive she was and he told me I was tripping, I was just looking for something new to bitch about, blah blah blah. Whelp here we are middle of winter and she's big as a house her tits are hanging low and he sure as fuck can't deny it now. More often than not I fucking hate it when I'm right. 
This is total bullshit. I'm fucked because it's fucking hard as fuck raising a litter if puppies. Her last litter was 12!!! Granted she will do most of the work for the first 4 weeks but I still have to figure out #1 WHERE THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT A WHELPING BOX IN AN RV THATS BARELY BIG ENOUGH FOR US NOW!!!! #2 HOW AM I GOING TO KEEP GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW MANY NEWBORN PUPPIES WARM ENOUGH TO STAY I have no heat dont even have most of the windows in the back half  the front half of my RV leaks when it rains i just have blankets and plywood tacked up to keep it somewhat half ass not freezing. 

I feel so guilty because it's my responsibility to get my dogs fixed but it's expensive as fuck. I did get a voucher once but it was way way far at 7:30 am and of course the truck wouldn't start and we missed it FMR. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I know that my husband and I'll figure it out and pull it out of one our asses at the last minute like we always do. I'm just scared what if we don't. I can't let her down or her puppies. I already did by not getting her fixed before she got pregnant. I'm just venting and looking for suggestions I guess. I entertained the idea of building some sort of an insulated dog house it side but there's a pretty big coyote population here so no. I've also been thinking maybe i should look into giving her up... It's apparent that I'm not equipped for a litter of puppies. We did fine last time but that was different.  I know that i would never forgive myself and neither would Buddy Jr that's his Mama they are closer than my butt cheeks.

zlh4uv,"I have some very specific questions about Cali. If a person wanted to start completely from scratch...clean slate...nothing but the shirt on thier back and wanted to settle down somewhere in Cali, how exactly would they do that?.

Obviously, you would need a bus ticket or you would have to hike/train-hop to get out there in the first place but then what?.

I read that before you can get any type of assistance (ie; cash, stamps, medical, etc), you have to have lived in Cali for at least 30 days. How do I prove that though?. Hang onto receipts or something?.

Also, I'm very confused about the whole shelter/pantry/day-station thing. I thought you could just walk in but apparently they have these outreach workers and homeless advocate people out there that give you a referral and thats how you get into a shelter (I guess?).

Also, what do the shelters require of you in order to get in?. Do they just help anyone who needs it or is there a long application process, background check, waiting list, 10 different pieces of ID, references and a bunch of other hassles and red tape?. Do you just go to the shelter/pantry or do they have advocates who come out, find you a shelter and drive you to it?. I mean, how helpful are they actually?.

Is it possible to just go to places in Cali, get found by an outreach team, get taken to a shelter, get assigned a social worker, get into a motel or more permenant housing and get other types of assitance with no issues or do you just have to be one of the few ""lucky ones""?.

zlewio,"4 people homeless together under the age of 18 please help any advice or resources welcome I’ve (16F) been couch surfing for years but at this point have one reliable place and that’s with my boyfriend(17M) and his 2 brothers (16M) (13M). his parents got an eviction notice almost 2 months ago and haven’t yet found another place (we’re evicted 6 days from now). For context my mom is a drug addict and my dad hasn’t talked to me since I was a child, I’ve been in and out of Homeless shelters and friends houses since I was a pre teen, I know my way around it and can get shelter if I need it but my boyfriend and his brothers’s parents don’t have citizenship. The kids have American citizenship the parents only have Mexican citizenship. In 6 days if we can’t find another place then the parents will go back to Mexico and leave the kids up here to fend for themselves because the parents state in Mexico is extremely dangerous and they have no family or stability down there and can’t support 3 kids down there. My boyfriend has his own car it’s an suv and we don’t have many belongings other than clothes. Me and my boyfriend get our work permits signed this Friday and will apply everywhere that we can, until then we have food stamps and about 200$ in savings, and As far as I know if they go to a youth shelter without parents in the country they’ll be taken to border camps for kids who’s parents have been deported and/or foster care and we will do anything in our power to prevent that, I have been in foster care myself and it’s horrors beyond imagination, and from what I’ve seen photos of and interviews of, the border camps for kids have them sleeping on tin foil blankets and it can take years to get them placed in a foster home or group home and so many kids there “disappear”.  There’s two safe parking programs that I know of in San Diego for people living out of their cars, dreams for change and Jewish family services, the Jewish one seems like they’d need ID or drivers license based on what they said on the phone interview (which not one of us have) and dreams for change is more low key I don’t think they’d need ID but there’s a 1 month+ waiting list. I guess I’m just asking that if any of u know any other safe parking programs or ways that we could stay at youth shelters without my boyfriend and his brothers being taken into custody because of their parents. My step dad lives at a sober living so we can’t stay there or the parking lot but he can help me by buying us baby wipes and soap and toothbrushes and food if we run out type of things so me and my boyfriend could maintain hygiene for job interviews next week. Our plan right now I guess is to survive as long as we can in the car and get a job as soon as a possible and find some shady studio or one bedroom on Craigslist that doesn’t need credit or documentation’s as long as we can give extra money type thing. The 16 year old will also hopefully be getting a job too soon so we’ll have three combined incomes. Any advice or resources welcome",throwawayeyeyette,52,2,3,1530

2. Bathroom, Toilet, Shower. I miss being able to use my own bathroom.
3. Cooking food. I hate eating gas station food.
4. Water: Being able to drink clean water whenever I want.
5. Having a pet. I miss my cat more than anything in this world. He was my companion and was with me to the very end.
6. Dating. I miss companionship. It's near impossible to date in our circumstances.
7. Privacy: It sucks having zero privacy.

Not having a pet feels like the ultimate punishment from the universe. One of the first things I'll do when I'm housed is to adopt another one. I miss my old boy so much. When I moved into my car. The first few nights, I confess to crying my eyes out not being able to see my boy. I was depressed thinking about him because I raised him. Giving him up for adoption hurt my soul. Those of you who like pets can relate. Losing your pet is like the loss of a child/best friend.

2. Starbucks

If you are newly homeless. I recommend finding a reliable rotation of bathrooms that you can use. Also if you can get a small hand towel. You can use it to do a quick wipe down of your body. Which is awesome to avoid smelling.

If you can, wash your hands and forearms with the soap that is there. Or just use plain water. Rinse the face as well.

So an emergency radio like this with a hand crank (and solar panel but don't expect to charge it in any reasonable time) would prove to be quite useful when disaster strikes and you lost power or when you simply don't have any easy way to get power. And of course you can also charge it like a normal phone though the usb port.

zckkyg,"Packs Hey everyone, I hope you’re all staying safe and warm this winter. If y’all don’t mind, I had a couple questions about packs I wanted to make to give out to homeless folks in my community this year. 

I did this last year around this time, but wanted to make sure I get people what they really need/want so I’d love to hear from you guys. I did research but I’d honestly prefer hearing from you directly. 

Last year the packs I made were in zip lock gallon bags and included:
- Socks
- Hand warmers and feet warmers (4 for hand, 4 for feet)
- Bandaids
- Instant packs of coffee
- Masks
- Soft chocolate candy 
- Salty snack (like Cheez-it’s)
- Hand sanitizer 
- Wipes
- Slim Jims 
- $5 bill per pack (I know it’s not a lot, but it’s all I could give per pack based on income)

I think there might have been one or two more things in there but I can’t fully remember.

My main questions if you don’t mind answering are:

1. What kind of snacks would you personally like to receive? I want to get something nutritious and that you’d actually want as opposed to just junk if that’s not helpful. 
2. What kind of socks do you prefer that could potentially be bought in bulk (unfortunately I can’t afford the really good $20 per pair kind, but I also don’t want to get the flimsy cheap ones either cause I know those aren’t going to do anything, so I’d love to hear if anyone has a favorite brand or go to that is maybe an in between. Best bang for your buck type of thing.) 
3. Are hand warmers and foot warmers good for a pack? 
4. Masks/hand sanitizers still helpful? 
5. Cash or gift cards?

zbobtv,"I'm going to talk about me, for a bit. For those who don't know... Slab City has taken homelessness in a slightly different direction, and it isn't for everyone.

But the title says I'm going to talk about myself.  Plenty won't give a shit... many of whom I myself have alienated with long comments, or preachy ideals.  I get it.  I've at least shown that for better or worse, I'm not stupid... so I get it.  I don't expect to ever be a cup of tea the majority would enjoy.

I am an individualist.

>an advocate of a social theory favoring freedom of action for individuals over collective or state control

This also includes individual responsibility... freedom of action most definitely **does not mean** freedom from consequences.  This is also NOT just another way of saying Anarchist.  It doesn't mean there should be a lack of collective or state control/regulation... it means that these things should favor the individual over the collective.  It comes up in silly ways... like... there shouldn't be tax breaks, just because someone gets married, because that puts the incentive on becoming a group over becoming the best individual one can.

Individualism doesn't mean one can't work more efficiently as part of a group and do more work.  It means one assesses what they do to ensure that they \*are\* efficiently contributing to the group.  An Individualist won't follow the mass, just because the mass is going that way.  Individualists don't follow trends.  Individualists get jobs, and prove to either be problematic when part of a team, or they end up altering the team to better recognize the individual strengths within it.  You don't make EVERYONE stock the heavy stuff, just because it is their turn... you have the strongest in the team do the heaviest lifting.  Is it fair?  Maybe not to the collective itself... but it is fair to the individuals within it, because playing to strengths would take a load off of those strong individuals in other ways within the team.  Tanks tank.

Being homeless teaches me how to better recognize and appreciate the difference between what I want, and what I need.  What I **need**... is food, water, a place to relieve myself, electricity, and a box to keep out most of the weather.  **That is it**.  That's all \***I**\* need, to be able to find moments of happiness.  And, for the most part, I can string together enough moments of happiness to cover the time I spend awake.  I say ""for the most part"" because I do live in a world that makes me angry when I look at it long enough.  Maybe I read too much science fiction as a kid, and I saw what mankind \*could\* be... and now I can't ever get that image out of my head.  Mankind definitely doesn't live up to my expectations.. but I am smart enough to know that my expectations are just that.... MINE and no one else's.  Even if others do share them.....they have theirs and they just look like mine.  I **know** mine are unrealistic for actual human nature... know it for a fact.  Knowing it, doesn't make it any easier when I see the world as it is, and all the ways ***I think*** it could be, simultaneously all... the... time.

So... I limit how much of the world I pay attention to.  I'd be a hermit in the middle of a city, living in my box with electricity, if I could connect with the job that would let me.  It isn't the fault of the system... it is my fault for my choices along the way, to where I am older with no viable career choices.... and employment options generally put me in direct competition with younger people who will be able to do that job better.... specifically because it is largely unskilled labor.  And again... I know that this is my fault for not being able to plan for my future better when I should have.  When I should have been planning for my future, I still didn't really know the difference between a dream and a plan.

When I graduated, the reason why I didn't go to the Berkley School of Music in Boston was because I didn't write the essay for the application.  Again, for better or worse, I can write essays like people have conversations... all day and at length.  I didn't write that essay, because I didn't think I belonged at that school.  See... I can't sight read.  That means I cannot look at a new piece of written music, and just play it as it is.  I can play, compose, and arrange... but I have to sit with that piece of music and work with it, before I memorize the passages and use the written music as a reference guide... or I have to hear it first.  That means I'd never pass the jury just to get into a music college, since that's one of the things they do.  You get sat down in front of strange/unfamiliar music, and you are required to play it.

Now... I probably should have just written it, because this was 1987, and that would have put me in Boston, in a music college, playing the Trombone when Ska became a thing and bands like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones came into existence.  I'm not saying I would have been good enough to play in that band... but it would have been like being in a grunge band in the Northwest, when grunge was just beginning  to be a thing.  I've just never been any good at imagining my own future in a realistic sense, over any kind of dream or fantasy.  \*I\* wanted to play the bass.  That's the route I followed.  I just didn't know then that what I really wanted..... was to arrange and compose.  I don't want to be a performer... I used to have to wear sunglasses on stage so I could close my eyes and block out the audience.  I stayed in a band once, because we never played out... we'd get together, and instead of writing and practicing pieces to get them perfect for performances, we'd jam for a couple of hours and go home.  We'd create these new constructs, work them out into something coherent on the fly, explore them for a few minutes... and then do it again in a different way.  We talked about wanting to get gigs... but none of us would put the effort in, and instead we'd get together three times a week and just play.  For a little more than two years.  I loved it.

Choices.

I've caused myself a lot of trouble over the years, by not knowing how to make better choices for my future.  I'd support  myself with cashier jobs, while I moved from band to band.  I've lived in all four corners of the lower 48... from Maine to Florida, from Washington to southern California, and a bunch of places in-between.  In my late 20's, I figured out that people were part of my problem... and I switched gears and started repairing computers.  I was... 26-27 at the time, that'd be what. 1997-1997.  I was in New Orleans, of all places, to give up on music.  And no... I didn't touch a Trombone once in all the times I've been in New Orleans.  I got a job at the first internet cafe in the French Quarter... and I started getting paid to repair desktops.  I'd done it for free for years before that as a hobby.  I was very proud of the AMD 486-DX133 I was carting around with me with people were just starting to use Pentium P90's and 120's.  Better architecture and processors for sure.... but that DX133 was like an older beefed up, beat-up muscle car being put against newer, sleeker mid-line vehicles.  If you want to compare processors to cars, that is.

I was also carting around a Yamaha controller, and doing multi-track composing with midi and custom soundfonts with realistic samples.  So the synthesized piano track would sound like a piano.. in 1996-1997.  I had cheap equipment I could skip upgrading, and create music I liked to listen to.  At that time, I was closer to realizing how I just need that box.  I didn't need an audience to approve of my creations, for my creations to make me happy.  I didn't need that external validation.  I didn't FULLY realize it then... I only started to.

I moved after the internet cafe closed in 2001.  I stayed with my grandparents and worked for a few months, made enough money to get back to Cape Cod to a seasonal job I knew of that included housing, used the saved money to cover the winter expenses, and did that for a few years, fixing computers on the side.  I chased a few job offers up and down the east coast for computer repair shops, worked independently passing out flyers sometimes... lived out of a van, stayed in a few shelters, got involved for a hellish four years with an old high-school flame from 2009 to 2013... went 3000 miles across the country and homeless again to escape.... and I failed to get any kind of foothold until I got here.

Now... here I am, on a ledge, already over the edge of a cliff.  I used this analogy here very recently.  Any of us who just couldn't make it work and ended up homeless, know that cliff I am talking about.  Actually, even the people who were pushed over that cliff, know about it.  I don't want to directly call it the Cliff of Homelessness, because that almost sounds like a Monty Python skit.  But we know what it is like to try to claw one's way back UP it.  It isn't a hill.  It isn't a mountain.  It isn't even a hole.  It is a cliff.

Once at the bottom of that cliff... it is possible to go sideways and just do things completely differently.  I don't really believe anyone should live naked in the Oregon woods, hunting with a spear and living in a cave... but that is a possibility.  We did it once.  Kinda.  With skins, not naked.  Most of us though, we want back up that cliff.. to how things were, or how they were \*supposed\* to be.  Indoctrination or desire doesn't matter as much when one is in the process of climbing back up.  Realizing the want to get back up is because of indoctrination, only means that much more work changing directions, with no safety net.  Realizing it is only desire, and not need, sometimes makes you want to just let go and fall back down.

I got to a ledge.  You wouldn't think it comfortable, and my choices have made it even harder to proceed up from here.  Getting a job here pretty much requires Spanish as a second language, and I took French (and never learned to think in it) in High School.  And that work is 26 miles away across desert and fields, and I have no license or car of my own.  I have access to an unregistered vehicle that gets used to make gasoline and supply purchases for a neighbor.  There is a single bus which services a stop 4 miles away, but not on a schedule that would work with most jobs.  There would have to be a car involved either getting to work, or getting home from work.  In exchange for forward progress, I can sit on this ledge almost indefinitely.  I have a box... you could have once called it a recreational trailer, but with the way the ceiling is coming down and separating from the wall in one corner, it is getting harder to call a habitable one.  It certainly wouldn't survive being moved.  It isn't mine.  It isn't on land anyone here owns.  I have solar.  I have an outhouse, and access to a tank of water.  I have a job, of sorts.  I earn $6.25 a day, working 7 days a week keeping a neighbor alive.  $200 a month, every day.  I had a day off in June when I went to the hospital in Brawley for dehydration.  I fill and start his generator, I check on him, I do his shopping for him, get the gas, kill the rats, light construction, troubleshooting.... I won't clean for him.  I insisted he pay someone else for that.  I carry a walkie-talkie all the time until midnight.  Out here, you get what you can, not what you should.

I know I have strong feelings about personal accountability.  I work hard at not putting myself into situations that I cannot handle being personally accountable for my actions.  Making sure I have food is my responsibility.  If I have to get the food from Commodities (aka, food bank once a month in the town of Niland, 4 miles away), or I have to make arrangements to get the 33 miles to Imperial, to go to the food bank.... then that is what I have to do.  I have to get a permanent mailing address I can count on so I can sign up again with SNAP.... using General Delivery here, while Calipatria is still handling Niland mail, and they could potentially eliminate postal service to Niland in the future, well..... I can't use General Delivery until I know whether or not to have it sent to Calipatria (which is 12 miles away) or Niland.  Changing a mailing address with social services here is apparently impossible, and why I am not on SNAP currently.  24 miles round trip in the desert, without either transportation, or paying for it with money I don't have... just to get the forms that get sent back with the same information.... let's just say this is the second option I don't want to HAVE to accept.  If I can get a Niland PO box of my own, before any final decision gets made, then it could make the difference between being accessible to me and not.  I recognize the uniqueness of my situation involving my personal details,  a burnt-down post office, and living in a rather hostile desert region.

I believe what I believe, because of what I've read, and learned... seen and heard... over the years.  I'm no different from anyone else in that regard.  I know that sometimes when a person asks for a specific piece of information, I want to delve into the why of it instead.  I've learned over the years, that the problems we see aren't always the problems that need to get solved.  I've learned how to see through most of my wants, to determine whether or not there was need within them.  I've learned that happiness isn't a destination.... it is the scenery on the way.  One can be happy anywhere.  Hell, the human brain contains the capacity to completely disassociate oneself from reality and send one to a happy place in times of extreme trauma.  One can be happy in a moldy tent, with an uncleaned month or two on them, reading a book by flashlight... or even moonlight.  One doesn't have to be happy WITH something, in order to be happy.  One can be unhappy with one's situation, while one is happy reading that book.  Or listening to music.  Or laughing at TikTok videos.  Or watching ducks.

People who say that they just want to be happy..... are either not being honest with themselves, or they are being manipulative in how they go about getting what they want.  What they really mean is that there is something they want, which they believe will MAKE them happy.  It almost never works, which is where the saying ""You can't buy happiness"" comes from.  Things don't make us happy.  WE make ourselves happy.  If we convince ourselves we can't be happy without something, we forget how to find happiness in all the other ways available.  We end up not giving credit to those moments of happiness we DO find... thus ignoring what does **actually** make us happy while we focus on the things we are missing instead.  There's also a connection to ""missing the forest for the trees"" there.

I'm 92% introvert... since we all have some of both in us.  I'm here, so I know I have to have some social contact.  I say things that are contrary sometimes, because I can see a larger picture involved.  I learned from reading Isaac Asimov that humans can be looked at as a single organism, and the general actions and direction of mankind can essentially be graphed out based on past performance.  That it will be possible to predict the next Dark Ages, based on psychoanalysis of the human organism as a whole, instead of just the actions of the individual.  This clashed with my individuality at first, but actually makes sense, because although on the whole, the actions of any one individual cannot be accurately predicted over time, and sometimes these actions can have an affect on the group as a whole... by and large individual actions are errant points on the graph.  I like Probability and Statistics as well... thank the first half of my Senior Year for that.  I can't control the group as a whole.  I can only control me.  I thank my introversion for that.

Maybe this will help some people understand why I am a mix of individuality and support for collective things.  I don't know.  I was born in the state with Hope on the flag, in the village named Hope.... spent the first 18 years of my life living on Hope Furnace Road.  Hope... is painful.  To quote Malcolm Reynolds ""***I ain't lookin for help from on high.  That's a long wait for a train don't come.***""  I try not to wish, and I try not to hope.  I accept, or I alter.  If I cannot alter, I do what I need to accept.  If I cannot accept, I alter what I need to.  And I know as humans, we are all capable of this.",bongart,16,1,3,1530

Living in a motel because my father (59) and I (31) have bad credit and can't get into a place anywhere! *NJ* We have been searching relentlessly, day and night - daily, for an apartment move into. (For a little under a year already, which is draining our funds at a pretty rapid rate.) We simply can not afford to buy, or rent, a home at the moment. Is there another option for my father and I to move in somewhere that Definitely accepts bad credit OR where we can live other than with family members/friends (not an option) and get out of this horrible motel? 

I really feel like I'm on the verge of having a mental breakdown.

What we've tried already 

We have even offered to pay more upfront as well as pay a years rent upfront if approved. We tried finding private landlords, low-income housing/HUD and ""no credit check/bad credit okay"" places, also. Nine months in and we have been denied by literally every last person we contacted. Side note: The places that claim, ""Bad Credit OKAY!"" and ""No Credit checks"" are straight lies and/or scams.

z5eo69,"Here's something that can help with the cold. Alrighty.  For all of us out here who have time on our hands, inadequate gear for the weather, and strange odds and ends that have collected over time in bags and boxes... here's a way to stay warmer, longer, when ""exposed"" to the elements living in a tent, or even on the street.  Although... if you are on the street, you might want to modify this.

You know those almost useless ""Emergency Thermal Blankets"" that aren't much more than thin, flexible, reflective material?  Don't use them in the expected way... unfolding and wrapping around oneself.  Instead, take the time to sew one BETWEEN two thin blankets.  You could finally make good use of that cheap sewing kit you picked up somewhere... you could use a length of wire as a needle and use string.  This doesn't have to be a professional job.  But... with time on your hands, you could quilt the motherfucker, sewing the entire thing up into rough two inch squares.  Less crinkling when you move around, and a more solid feel to the new ""comforter"" you just made. if you quilt it.

The point is... you put the thermal blanket between two other fabrics.  This will make the whole thing last longer... MUCH longer.

Want to get crazy?  Put a thermal blanket between two sleeping bags.

The reflective material blocks the transmission of heat.  It isn't insulation, like the poly fill in the sleeping bag.  It is a barrier.  This is why, by itself, it can make you feel warm when you should be dry in a jacket.  The material itself doesn't stand up to direct abuse... thus, the thermal blanket sandwich.

Why sew it all together?  To keep shit from bunching up when you sleep.

A couple of those white Red Cross blankets, the Emergency Human Plastic Foil Wrap, some ""sewing""... and you've got yourself the warmest cover you can imagine.  Except maybe using sleeping bags instead of blankets... but then the whole assembly becomes unwieldy.

Advanced points for putting a thermal blanket between two tarps for overhead shelter.  Use your imagination.  Anywhere you don't want heat going... that Walmart Ozark Trail $3 sheet of reflective plastic could potentially be a gift beyond repayment.  Any way that you can sandwich it between materials... the longer you will make it last.

The ~~Master's~~ Masters Class involves using them to block the heat of the sun to create cooler shelters.

EDIT:  I was going to say something darkly clever-ish about the class not being for masters, but actually belonging to some **fictional** Josh ""Joe Bob"" Master, aka the ""Master"" of emergency thermal blanket usage... but that seemed too convoluted.",bongart,49,1,3,1530

I've ceased meeting new people almost entirely and I know that this trend will only continue as long as I maintain housing.

Homeless Carless with a small dog I have a 17 year old daughter whom fortunately has a wonderful father that she can stay at most nights and I'm pregnant. We slept in the back of the U-Haul truck the first five nights but had to return it. But that counteracts with saving to move into a spot I do have a full-time job I've worked out for many years but with the price of rentals and not being prepared to have to move it's going to take some time to come up with what's needed to get into a spot and paying for motels kind of depletes the purpose. I'm trying to not look like a complete failure to my daughter. I would never want her to know I slept in the back of U-Haul truck how traumatizing that would be to her. most hours of everyday I'm on the phone calling whatever resources I can find and it all seems to be one giant loophole it keep hearing about these Outreach programs that will get you off the streets fast and into temporary housing and then permanent housing especially if you have a job which I have but I've yet to find one that actually does anything but send you back to square one which is a big circle all I'm asking for is any input on where to go to get off the streets or to get into a car I'm not asking for anything of monetary value just advice maybe a prayer or two. thank you,Minimum-Historian-66,27,1,3,1530

z11tb7,im about to be homeless in a few days and i need some advice i dont really know if i will be homeless or not (im sure i will be) but i would still accept some advice for a place to a shelter or something. As it stands rn I live in tampa fl with my single mom and 3 grandkids kids i love them but after what happened yesterday i dont feel like i have a place i can truly call my home. a little bit of background im 24 yrs old  i have lived with my mother all of my life and during most of it i was always quiet i kept to myself i always tried to respect other ppls boundaries spaces and rules and have never cussed my mother or anything but after yesterday i just cant do it anymore during my 18 years as a teenager my mother would always get on me for stealing things and call me a liar and cuss me and i can understand why back then i had a problem and i didnt notice how bad it was until i turned 19 and i kid you not long story short i ate a entire box of slim jims in 3 days. i think there was like 120 in that box alone when i came to realize my mother is right wtf am i doing to myself is this really how i want to spend my life? i dont wanna end up looking like the biggest disappointment in my family so after i turned 20 and decided to grow up. i started practicing self control to stop myself from taking more than i actually need because not everyone can afford everything and i now understand that im helping a family of 4 around that time my first nephew was already 4 and developing his story his little sister was following behind him and the youngest 1 was still a newborn and i dont want them to end up like me. so for 4 yrs i spent most of my time controlling myself around food and actually started helping around the house i would sweep up the kitchen help mom get the kids ready for school watch out for the kids to get home move sum boxes or furniture around to her liking wash the dishes take the kids for a walk for 30 minutes so she could have a break watch them eat so we make sure they eat all of their food etc and my mom is helping me look for a job we are supposed to be at a job interview tommorow i was so excited. and i will admit im not a perfect human being either sometimes i forget to brush my teeth and put on deordant and stuff but even i still do everything my mom says without talking back getting a attitude and tried to control my anger because my mom would constantly get mad over the smallest thing i do wrong when i make 1 mistake be it small or big she would correct what i do in a smart mouth mannered way like she was annoyed by me and threaten to kick me on the street like she did my sister if i step outta line for 1 second (my sisters fine we just dont talk about her much) when i never meant to hurt her in any way or form possible im just trying to help. but as always as this went on i was getting angrier and more depressed day by day until yesterday i snapped. story goes that the day before my mom had cooked us some chilli for dinner we all got our share we ate and there was still half a big pot of hot chilli on the stove for everyone to enjoy i didnt get anymore bc i was full and went to bed apparently what i didnt know was my mom had saved her chilli in the microwave and the reason i didnt know this was because i never looked in that microwave in the first place and sum1 ate it im not blaming anyone but if she would have told me she was saving sum for later i would have never touched it and told my kids not to either because i know thats her food but she insisted it was me and didnt back down we got into a little screaming match but after that it was over. next few days my big brother bought over 3 cases of diet coke for my mom to enjoy being me i know those sodas are for my mom only shes made it clear that those are for her only so i didnt touch any of em. these particular soda cases tho had 2 long but shallow openings on the top it looks like sum1 grabbed a knife and cut 2 long deep holes on it where you can stick your hand in and grab a soda just like that apparently one of the holes had somehow gotten bigger like someone already grabbed a soda or two and sum were missing from there and it was the way the pack was designed i guessed because they all looked like that when it got here i dont blame other ppl and i thought my mom knew because we usually check the stuff before we put it up but you can probably guess what happened she blamed me as usual and made me look like a fool even though i never touched them bc i understand boundaries and the rules applied to them and threatened to kick me out and well i just lost it we ended getting into a huge argument and i was so angry and frustrated i not only cussed out my mom like she did me but she even tempted me to call the cops and dragged a officer into this over chilli and a soda i never stole now shes planning to evict me and as for me i no longer want to live in this house i wanna live alone the problem once your homeless your just that unless you know what to do first and i dont really have any friends or a phone but i do have a bag with 4 pairs of clothes a blanket basic hygiene stuff and sum food a big bag of raisans 2 breakfast bars some ramen noodles i havent cooked yet and sum rice crispy treats im willing to work full time just to have a place where i can live looking into going to a shelter so i can restart my life off right until i find a place to call home do you guys have any advice. like i said before i love my parents but im sooo done with life in this home. thx for reading this essay it must have been a pain.,Method_Key,18,1,8,1024

I got evicted from my apartment in July and I'm still currently homeless, but I've had my car to stay in since losing my place. I know so many people in my city who live in a tent, some that sleep on the sidewalk with a little sleeping bag only, and I feel like I have it pretty easy, comparatively.

I don't know what I would have done over the summer without my air conditioning, in the 107° weather and right now when the temperature is almost in the 20's, I am so thankful for the heater to keep warm by. 

To all of those out there struggling and feeling hopeless or alone, my heart is with you. I know how good I have it, and I don't take it for granted.

She lives at a but stop that is open to the elements. I find it interesting that she is very nonchalant about her situation. She say she's been on the streets for 22 years.This makes me wonder if she is really interested in no being homeless. I would think that in 22 years she would have been able to get on her feet. I see her on a daily basis and she doesn't do drugs or alcohol and doesn't seem to have mental issues. I could be wrong though.

Im fortunate enough to have a friend that can help me find a job. I cannot find any resources about where I should go if I’m about to become homeless. Everything I have found is referral only. All I’ve heard from shelters in Milwaukee is very negative things. My mom says I should be put in a facility where they can help me with my mental health. That would be 8000 a week which I don’t have. Most of these places also don’t take state insurance. I just feel lost. So if anybody can give some resources in the Milwaukee area that’d be very appreciated,Clemiecakes,12,1,3,1530

I imagine that if your homeless in the city, your daily life consists of homeless shelters or camping in the woods at night, soup kitchens and thrift shops, gyms and public libraries plus panhandling, dumpster-diving, looking for work or flying a sign.

And I guess if your a homeless vagabond/nomad, your day consists of hopping trains, hitch-hiking, hanging out at truckstops, begging/working for meals at various restaurants, sleeping in the woods or motels, getting to see the country, etc.

I guess if your up there in years or disabled, it's better to be in the city and close to resources and if your young and healthy, maybe being a vag/nomad is a better option. I don't know. Any thoughts on this?. Thank you for reading...",veryberryblue,15,1,3,1530

ynlv7m,"[UPDATE] 18 male arrived and homeless, help Hello reddit, it has been a few days since I posted
Firstly thank you everyone that gave me advise on what to get done and how to proceed. A lot has happened since then and I figured I could use some advise on what to do next: 
Since the first night which I spent at a bus stop and public bathroom room I have managed to stay off the street. After that first night I went to the NSW communities and justice office and they have been a major help in getting me somewhere to sleep, if anyone needs housing ASAP in Sydney then call LINK2Home they were a massive help and have got me set up in a place that is working with me till at least this Tuesday. Which has been great. Sadly that is where the good ends, the first issue is that the place i am staying in is temporary and i am currently not eligible for housing assistance as i do not posses an income, the staff at the Community and Justice place pointed me towards Centrelink and getting set up with a Jobseeker claim which would allow me to receive a bi-weekly payment until I old get a job. IN theory this is good, in practice it has been painful to jump through the hoops to get it, i have been to there offices (Centerlinks) a few time and on Friday they said it was sent in to be urgently processed due to my situation and i would hear back on whether i got it by Wednesday this week, however i went to check the website today and wouldn’t you know that the claim has been paused due to some missing paperwork that was not need a day ago. They would like to present some sort of document to show i can not be with a guardian or family. This has really pissed me off as i now need to go back to there offices tomorrow and sort this out, but I already explained to the lady who said she noted it down n the claim that i had run away from home and she said that was alright. It’s not that big a deal for me as i left for not the worst reasons but imagine if someone left to escape domestic violence and now they are being asked to get a letter or something from the abusers to say she/he is being abused? That is my current issue to get sorted tomorrow and as soon as that is done i need to find myself some work. I was wondering if anyone on here know the best way to find work in Sydney. I have no prior experience and only to a year 11 education which much limit my options but any advise will help. 
One of my options which is not a “cop out” but something i has always had a passive interest in is the military pathway, i just don’t know what i will do with the stuff i have with me as I can’t take it to basic training and i would only want to use the military as a stepping stone rather than a be all end all. But this is something to think about another time. 
Sorry for the bad grammar/spelling, on account of the late nights and dyslexia

(Addition)
Sorry i forgot to bring is up and i wanted to get some input, but i am sure people are wondering why i left my family and flew 16 hours to Australia and cut contact. I do not really wish to get into the details but the best way to phrase it is a break down of relationships and mental health issues. Allthough it seems i manged nothing close to a clean break as they manged to track me down in about 72 hours due to the limited amount of flights leaving the country we were in and the limited amount of places i could have ended up in. They manged to figure out which city i was in and filled a missing persons report which resulted in a police visit and medical inspection. Luckily after checking my abondended email it seems they have decided to leave to alone and only ask i keep in contact which for now is a hard no. Funny enough when i had talked about feeling with my therapist that very few people who claimed to be my friends in Dhaka would notice i had left it seems i was correct, as i did leave a message behind for them wishing them the best and so forth and of the 7 or so people that i was close with 2 sent message and one of them thinks this is a fun little joke/stunt. Which is both validating and a little disappointing. I knew i was right about the people around me, but i guess on some level i wished it was not true.",m1ssingkeys,8,1,3,1530

Between April 2020 - July 2021 I worked a full-time warehouse job. I ended up getting fired when I tested positive for Covid and they wanted me to continue going to work full-time even though I felt really sick and uncomfortable being around people knowing I’m positive.

I tried applying for unemployment soon after that but it never worked out. I wasn’t allowed to apply online for unemployment benefits because EDD California doesn’t let you apply online if you have a history of working in another state which I did at the time. My only other options was to call or mail-in my application. I mailed in my application every month for 6 months straight and they never received my application even though I’m 100% sure I mailed it to the right address every time. So after a month of them never getting back to me after mailing in my first application I started calling the EDD number hundreds of times per day and to this day I’m yet to talk to someone over the phone with EDD. I COULD NOT GET CONNECTED. No matter how many times I call, despite the day of the week or time of the day, it always says they’re full and to call a different time. …it’s now been almost 1 and 1/2 years and still can’t get connected or receive my benefits.

The problem here is that I couldn’t pay my bills. I’m so behind in bills that I had to start sleeping in my car and have since. I’m writing this in my car right now. I can’t sleep properly anymore. I have so much back and shoulder pain. It’s impossible to catch up with my bills and survival expenses at this point when you’re poor and trying to put gas in your car, get food, stay safe, etc. I don’t have anyone in my life. I’m a woman in her 20s and I don’t feel safe at any shelter. All this because I can’t get in touch with unemployment???!!!! I went into the EDD office several times and only once were they able to help me by providing a telephone appointment weeks ahead with an EDD representative. What happened after that? I get a call, I answer, they immediately hang up, and they leave a voice message with no way of calling them back and a simple “sorry you missed our call.” Like no I fucking did not miss it. It’s almost like they’re doing this on purpose. I can’t do this anymore. I’m in so much physical and emotional pain all because of this bs, if anything it’s made it harder to find a job. I’ve never spent so much money on basic necessities. Its really really expensive to be poor. I wanna end it already. I don’t deserve this.",RemixHipster,6,1,3,1530

She was a very nice older woman, but I don't think she had any family looking out for her from what I understand. Unfortunately, there is an extremely high rate of homelessness in my area and right now the general public opinion is exhausting, anger, frustration, stereotypes, and etc. surrounding the issue - the empathy for the problem has almost entirely run out because of a variety of reasons. That being said, since this woman had almost no family that anyone knew of, the general opinion around homelessness is currently to just sort of look the other way/move on, and most of her friends are either homeless or very near homeless, I'm worried that she will not be given a proper burial or ceremony to honor her life or allow her friends to grieve. I only recently got to meet her a few months ago once I started walking on a road that she would regularly camp out on so I'd try to talk with her/check in on how she was, but I know some people knew her for years and were very close to her.

Does anyone here know of any resources that help cover the costs of funding a funeral for a homeless individual? I'd really like to try to put something together for her or even just a very extremely simple headstone so that she's not just left in some unmarked grave, but I don't know of any places that assist with that type of thing. Thank you all and stay safe this winter!",interested_in_ed,28,1,3,1530

yhbshs,"18 male, arrived and homeless help Hello, I need help, my situation is unique in the sense that 8 have placed myself in the position, however let me explain;
I am an 18 year old male as of a 2 weeks ago, and I took money from my family who I lived aboard with to get a flight back to Australia where we are from. I left a short note saying why I left (related to mental health) and removed all my social media and so forth. Now 30 hours later, I have landed in Sydney Airport and although I strted with 600 aud to get me set up with two weeks rent then a job I am down to 40 aud as I have to pay to leave the country I was coming from. What can I do now?, I have no where to go and will not contact my family (most live in Australia, but I did this to get away). I would like to get a job and a place to live, and because I left my family and where I was I would like to finish high-school. But my current focus it staying off the street, or on it for as little time as possible. I do not think I should go to a shelter for youth or homeless shelter, as I have placed myself in this position and there are people that need more support than I do. 
I will stay in the airport as long as possible and will leave by the morning, hopefully by then I have a plan
Please I need some help/advise",m1ssingkeys,12,1,8,1024

They record people in vulnerable positions, in most cases berate them for being in the position they are in life, as if they can see the bigger picture of the situation, and then move on in life as if they're doing a good thing. Not only that, but people constantly are able to view the videos of their most vulnerable positions in life. 

I feel like this is sick, and the people who support their channels just don't understand why this isn't good.

yh6ir1,"Basic Guide (just general could go on forever indefinitely, but ultimately feel free to input and brainstorm). Feel free to DM though. No ego just love helping so keep competitive crap to self. Thank You. Been homeless for over a year and documenting my journey. Lived successful on the streets alone entire time. Actually in Chicago supporting someone I met on here. She's absolutely experienced most tragic circumstances.

STEP 1: You will need to move to an area that gives you access to resources. No arguments there. Google homeless services, shelters, etc. At least go to establish stuff like an address, various documents you might need, apply to programs like food stamps and Medicaid, place to clean yourself, feed yourself, sleep, etc. There's a government program where you can get free unlimited cellphone service and even a tablet. I went with qlink wireless so Google them.  I don't recommend staying at most shelters unless they're truly supporting your progress instead of vast majority just being a place to exist till death where bad habits and complacency are norm. You'll use this system as long as you need until you're established enough to venture further. I'm in Vegas because southwest weather is more conducive not dealing with rain.

STEP 2: Find a job. There are plenty of options there. Again can use homeless and government resources to help. At least try temp agencies. Apps like Instawork. Amazon is a great place to apply to. Again stay at shelter as long as you feel like best option. You've got your basics covered like place to sleep, food, money, etc.

STEP 3: I only was there for first couple days to establish services I mentioned. Once I got Food Stamps, Medicaid, ID Card then I left because had money to buy stuff to live on my own. For many reasons didn't want to get a place, but stay outdoors. Now you can leave to housing like renting a room in someone's home. Keep working while staying at shelter until have enough income and job stability to leave.

STEP 4: Regardless need to get methods of self defense. I love Amazon. Again can order stuff to shelter or I use Amazon locker locations. Get pepper spray gel. Small version that has a strap around hands. Easy to walk with securely which you should always visibly show. I'd also get a defense/tactical knife with a hilt. Obviously worse case scenario and again when possible visibly display it. Also, avoid walking near anyone suspicious or going to any rough part of town. I don't care how far out of way gotta go. I've been attacked and I'm a former top level athlete who wrestled in college. Unfortunately it's much tougher for women which means way more precautions. Obviously avoid night and unpopulated areas. Try to let someone know location for example I text my buddy places I frequent and in my case place I sleep at.

STEP 5: If you do wanna stay homeless, but on your own like I'm doing, then gotta buy gear and find a ""camping"" spot. I only go to shelter to get regular mail once every week or two weeks. Again used Amazon. You'll need a rucksack first off aka camping/military style backpack. Either can get a blowup camping mat to lay on whatever surface you're gonna sleep on or yoga mat which can roll-up to secure it using lower straps of rucksack. I wrap everything I place unsure using scented waterproof garbage bags.

Inside place shower supplies and anything else that might bust like laundry stuff although I do mine once per week and just buy a single serve at dollar store. In between I spray my clothes down using antibacterial clothing freshener. Use whatever deodorant, sprays, etc to help.

Then I place my clothes on top of that. Then my towels. Inside outside biggest pocket put hygiene products, meds, etc. In one big side compartment put a big thermos for water. In other I put miscellaneous stuff. Stuff like straps, ropes, multipurpose tool, lighter, first aid supplies, etc. Use other compartments as you see fit. For example my very top on one the flap I store my electric shaver kit. Fit in a rechargeable power pack, power cords, devices, etc somewhere too.

I'd get a sleeping bag from Walmart. Better to be safe so I get one at least rated to freezing. I actually sleep in as much clothing as I need. Basically what I wear out in public covered with whatever else I need. For pillow can get inflatable one but I prefer one that rolls up and fluffs up by patting hands around it. One on Amazon by Wise Owl Outfitters. I'll try posting various stuff I got. But basically saying yes get a pillow lol. Roll-up sleeping bag and strap it on using top straps that come down to close top of rucksack which then secures all the contents inside. 

In terms of other stuff I've got a waterproof poncho which covers almost entire body plus big enough to even put over your rucksack. Has a hoody with a lid on it too. I've got a huge waterproof warm bulky jacket that I attach and drap over my rucksack. Figure out best way to attach. It'll cover up your rucksack like a cape lol.

If needed I have a duffle bag that I wear crossbody. Put whatever you think is best. I like putting in gym clothing, food, whatever extra that need more space for, but truthfully more so stuff that won't severely impact me if I lose it. If, for example, you find a great storage spot like for me there's one near where I sleep that's hidden can keep whatever you'd like there like wardrobe, sleeping gear, etc. Keep your duffel bag there when not needed or get something else specifically for storage. Always keep your rucksack with you. Up to you but can outfit it with gps tracker for worse case scenario. I keep an old phone turned on at bottom of bag wrapped up in trash bag. I'll check it every other day and charge as needed. App on my real phone can track it.

STEP 6: Buy public transit pass. Finding a spot. Google Maps satellite view is greatest weapon. Map out places you find essential. I'm near a 24 hour grocery store. Very least can use bathroom. Gym which I not only use to exercise but clean up and even charge stuff. I'd recommend Planet Fitness. Panera Bread is another major place. Go there to chill, charge and do whatever I need. They've got a Sip Club unlimited drinks like coffee, tea, soda, lemonade for only $12/month. Take advantage of free trials though. Libraries are great too. I also look for fairly easy access to work. You'll only go to shelter for mail here and there so not major priority logistically.

I'm at a park. It's actually got a sink on the outside of bathroom structure so always accessable. Near all the spots I told you. So once I find a spot or spots that seem promising I'll ride bus there and do a walk around. I'm behind a bush in the corner against a brick wall barricading park from residential neighborhood. Also a big contributing factor is needs to be safe area. Another factor is how visible you are coming and going. Park I'm at is huge and not very active. Coming back to it at night is easy though because nobody is there. Guess trespassing helps keep them out lol. Luckily the dirt is soft enough and I prefer firmer surface so laying seeking bag directly on ground is perfect. If have hesitation about critters which I personally never had issues with or care too much about can spray area, put traps, whatever else you think is needed. Let somebody trusted know where you area.

STEP 7: Know makes it lonelier, but best to not hang around or associate with other homeless folks. Drug use, mental health, bad habits, getting taken advantage of, even harmed isn't worth risk. You're a target. Vast majority don't want or are able to improve themselves. They've got nothing to lose by dealing with you while you've got everything to. It's tough but obviously lean on online communities like this. Befriend people who are integrated into society. Join social clubs and activities. Personally my first step was get mental health treatment. Take full advantage of free healthcare aka Medicaid. Prioritize health and hygiene. This is about building foundation so no rush or pressure, but everything is dependant upon your ability to feel secure with yourself first. I love studying philosophy like stoicism, listening to audiobooks, creating social media content, etc. Make sure to find social outlets because need at least one person who can at least have conversation with on a deeper level.

STEP 8: Always stay connected to support systems like this group on Reddit. Never forget there are people willing to care and help. Before I got mental health treatment I thought nobody would understand or be embarrassing to mention certain things. Complete opposite. Actually was best thing because being involved with genuine people encourages further positive development. I've been blessed enough to learn from various experiences without fully going crazy haha. Trial and error. So I'm always here to at least suggest because almost guaranteed have knowledge regarding things.

Feel free to reach out and that goes for anyone. If curious can check out my social media by finding links on my profile or DM for anything. Trust me I don't feel there's anything special about me or have any ego. This is about overall help. Just like I've been fortunate enough to receive I'm doing best I can to be there for others. Hope it helps.

Other Resources/Tips: Planet Fitness for hygiene and charging devices, Panera Bread (sign up for Sip Club. Use free trials. Can keep registering as many times via different emails. Once you can't only $12 per month. Good spot to chill and charge devices. Yes, junk but can at least get calories from drinks if needed), libraries and dumpster diving (which I truthfully use for food as needed, but probably best to DM me for details), parks and nature areas, malls, etc. Again, contact me for whatever.

ygxq03,"Always reading/hearing about how wonderful the west coast is if your homeless... Yeah, not sure if it's even true anymore or what it's like there now but it seems like every time I start reading about the best place to be homeless, it's always Cali, with Washington and Oregon running a close second and third place. Even on Youtube and in forums, everyone is always talking about how great life is out there if your homeless. Is it really true?.

I was out in Cali about 30 years ago and can vouch for the fact that it was pretty decent. The locals were really cool and laid-back, lots of good services and even the cops seemed pretty easy-going and even helpful. For example, I was invited into the home of a disc jockey. I didn't even know the guy but he invited me into his house and turned out to be a really cool guy. Then, I got stopped by a cop and he took me out for coffee and donuts and then, drove me to a homeless shelter which turned out to be a pretty decent one.

I was up in Washington (state) and some older dude (I guess he was lonely or something) invited me to live with him and treated me really well while I was there. I stayed there for about a week and I didn't even know the guy!.

The people/culture out on the west coast also seems much more open-minded, laid-back and friendly but I have no idea what it's like today. I never stayed in downtown LA or anything like that. These were just small-medium sized towns.

I'm almost 2,500 miles from the west coast now so it would be one heck of a journey getting back out that way again but it was a pretty decent experience tbh.

Colorado was pretty good too. I stayed in a really nice, clean shelter. Hardly anyone there. Got clean clothes, a good meal and a bed for the night. Staff were very nice and helpful.

Anyone else here have a good experience out west?. I don't think I'd care for Florida (I've read some pretty bad things about being homeless in that state) and NY sounds like it has a lot of good services but it's way too crowded for me.",veryberryblue,54,1,3,1530
ygvarj,"Is a world without homelessness possible? Is a world without homelessness possible?
 
We believe so, but it’s up to us to make it happen.
How?
Simple ➡️ 
we start by collecting enough signatures so a new tax law is passed which dictates that everyone within a state will give .50 Cents a paycheck. 
And why would we need money? You might ask.
Well, like that we can buy infrastructure or terrains on each state where the homeless can take refugee! Food, clothing, and medical attention.
We as well will be capacitating them to re join the work force by teaching them skills that are highly in demand currently!
And no worries, if they are not suited to re join the work force we will send them to a nursing home! Or facility where they can live comfortably.
We will teach them how to grow food and be self sufficient, while establishing organic markets for everyone! Give the power back to the people! Right!?
Everyone is welcome.
The homeless, runaways, and anyone that needs a safe heaven. 
state by state is how we will start this project and like that we will keep improving it as we grow. 
After it's all set and done we should be all over the USA, we will move to the rest of the world. 
It’s time for us to do a real change, it’s time for us to make a better future while having fun ����
 
Ps; we need all the help we can get. If this tax law can become a reality we will definitely need kind hearted people that really want to help. 
We will need all type of professionals so we can drive the system. 
We are the universe itself, we can do this.

I only have enough money for 2 months. My Rent is being jacked up in January And I will not be able to afford it. 

To give a little back story, I live with a family members friend that I hadn't seen since I was a small child. When I was re introduced to her, she told me that rent was $950 a month and that utilities were covered, so we'd both be paying $450 right? Wrong. For 5 months I had paid that, only to get a notice from my roommate stating that the rent was going up, so I had to pay $550 a month. So I was like, ok, I'll try to get the money. But when I saw the official notice it said the current rent was $650 PER MONTH, NOT $950, ANDTHAT THEY WERE RAISING IT TO $750. now, I was kind of irritated, confused, and felt cheated. so, I went to her and what did she tell me? She told me ""oh yeah, that's cause you're paying for utilities"" remember how she told me that I wasn't paying utilities and that they were covered?? Yeah, so either she is only paying $250 for rent, or she's pocketing my Money.

ydhqh6,"Using a mobile phone while homeless I have some questions about using and maintaining a mobile phone while homeless...

How/where do you get your phone charged?. Are there free charging stations?. Maybe public libraries?. Do you just go to a random biz and ask if you can charge your phone there?.

How about a signal if you do not have a current phone plan or the money for one?. Are there free wifi spots and where are they?. Are there apps that you can download that have free wifi spot detectors?.

Where do you keep your phone to keep it safe and from getting stolen?. Do you loan it to strangers if they ask to use it?. Like, some random dude walks up to you, claiming his phone just died and asks to use your phone to make an ""emergency"" call, etc.

And finally, how do you navigate while going from one place to another?. Can you still get paper maps or an atlas for free or cheap or do you need to use GPS and a nav app and if so, what nav apps are the most useful?.

ydbk9z,"What do y'all do for mail? So, in March my wife left me with the kids. It's been nasty, I have some mental and physical health issues that I cope with through strict processes, that ex and I could not get on the same page on. That created a very large amount of stress and anxiety in our life together and it (I) just became too much to handle. 

A large part of my issues is that I've never been in a financial situation where I could prioritize my healthcare. So with this divorce, I decided to make my healthcare a priority. After crunching the numbers, I realized I would not be able to do that supporting two households. Hell I couldn't do it being the only income in 1 household. Thankfully, ex decided to move her and the kids back to her parents, so the financial load is less. Anyway, I made a conscious decision to be homeless while I 1: get since of these health issues dealt with, and 2: really figure out wtf I want out of life. 

The next step was figuring out some of the logistics. I'm a large individual (not fat, 6'3"" 260 ish) with a history of back, hip, and knee injuries, so living out of my sonota wasn't appealing. So I made a career change, got my commercial drivers license, and went over the road trucking. First 6 weeks or so were rough as I didn't quite have the capitol up front to equip the truck, but now that's going pretty good (wish I would have waited another week or two before buying a fridge to get a bigger one with a better freezer).

So there's only one logistical thing I'm still trying to figure out, which is postal service. I went to the post office near my companies terminal to get a pobox and they weren't exactly helpful.

I noticed a lack of attentiveness and compassion towards him in general and some don't understand why I spend my time and energy trying to help him (I am trying to inform him of the government financial assistance available to him and ways to obtain long term housing) It's interesting he told me I am the only one who has personally reached out to him to help him in any kind of way which he greatly appreciates. I can't help but wonder if he was a female or senior woman if the treatment towards him would be different.

Ironically I was watching an interview with a community social worker (from our city) who said the women's shelters are night and day compared to the men's shelter where there's more compassion, understanding and extension of help towards women whereas in men's shelters there's a lack of resources and supports for them and the expectations for them to simply buckle up and get themselves out of their situations but because of that very lack of supports many men end up stuck and unable to move forward.

As far as I understand, a homeless person needs the following at a bare minimum to be able to get back on their feet:

1. A set of clothes, underwears, towels, toilet paper, wallet, belt, socks, shoes
2. Grooming (Haircut, Shaving, etc.)
3. Hygiene-related items
4. Food
5. Smartphone with a plan
6. Laptop
7. Internet connection
8. Place to live with a kitchen, utensils and other household items
9. Electricity
10. Job
11. Car

I would like to organize this for one or two people. I don't want to do this through a charity or some organization and would like to deal a person directly myself so I can monitor their progress and see what else I can do to turn their life around. I am not rich or anything but I think I can get most of the items listed above for cheap on eBay or something. The only major expense on this list is the car and house, which also I need to figure out for them.

It would be nice if I can help them get a job and they help me cover the expense I initially made for them so I can do the same for the next homeless person but if they can't then it's okay.

Are there any online communities like this where people get together to accomplish this together or am I on my own?",kudikarasavasa,15,4,3,1530
yc1c1j,"lost my room in a day So in my last post I showed a room that was provided by my employer and I was so happy about it. I went to work for the first day and I worked really hard. I didn't have the experience of being a waiter but I learned fast and the manager said I'm good at it.

And then, as I expected, shit happened. 

The next day the owner of the restaurant told me that he's sorry because he has to fire me. I was shocked because I think I did a good job. The owner said one of his nephews is coming here and he needed a job so he has to take my position. Losing the job also means losing the place to stay so I begged him to give me a few more days so I can find a new job. He agreed to let me stay there for a couple days. Then I called several places and one of the places said they are hiring and they also offers place to stay. I was so happy I found a job in 24 hrs and I agreed. My former boss knew it then told me not to work there because they treat people like shit, but I couldn't wait, I needed money, and I don't wanna cause too much trouble to my former boss, so I still went there.

After seeing the living environment I immediately regretted it. It's a house and there's 10 people living in there and 6 of them are living in the living room with me. I got a bed and that's it, I couldn't even change my clothes without being seen by someone else. The entire house is messy and dirty and there are food, boxes and shoes everywhere. The bathroom is untouchable and full of stains. Even homeless shelter I stayed is better than this.

I started wondering if I really wanna be there. I don't have a choice because winter is coming and I need a place to stay and a job so I can make money. I don't know how long I can stand here.

I am fighting to stay where I am abroad but am most likely going to be evicted and will probably be homeless once I arrive back in the states. In any case, I am preparing for what I think is the worst that could happen to me and/or a very difficult time. 

Because of the coming winter, I changed my mind from Chicago to Atlanta. Two metros where I think there must be good transportation, some decent infrastructure for the homeless, and similarly probable chances for me to find some employment. And the plus with Atlanta – besides having the benefits of a metropolitan area and being in the South so it's probably going to be somewhat warm – is that there are far less homeless people there than in Chicago, which I'm assuming means less competition for resources. Is this a good choice? Is there any detailed, tactical approach to choosing cities?

Also, I'm looking to score a place in a homeless shelter. Would they accept me, a 23-year old, able-bodied male? Or would it be hard to find a place and would I have to stay in the street? (I won't have money so I won't be able to rent an apartment for a while and being in the street is the number one thing I am trying to avoid) When I arrive in Atlanta, should I call 2-1-1, the police, or directly the shelter? Should I call shelters ahead of my arrival to ask about available spots?

Luckily I had drunkenly vented to one of my twin sisters when they FINALLY reached out to find out how I was. I cried, I was honest and open about my addiction. I was clear about how it felt to be the last one of 9 and how pretty much everyone has someone within the family. I cried ALOT, I had never been so frank and it was mainly coz they asked. Which let me know it was safe to speak out. 

The twins put money together and got me a 4night stay in a Travelodge with breakfast. These two things happened at the same time, getting the call about the Hostel and my sisters helping me and hearing me out. I was so grateful, I showed my appreciation to both my family and my housing team. Spent the weekend just getting my shit together. Trying to forge some normalcy and spending time with a friend here and there. Taking hot showers and eating substantial food. It had been just over 4 days of sleeping rough and hiding in gyms. Something had finally happened. 

Today, I’m sat in the Hostel, the room is VERY hot, a little boxy but it’s mine for the coming weeks. I have a support team downstairs who are going to help with housing, dental and health and even opticians as I recently lost my glasses on one of my binges. I also asked for help with money advice and ways to improve my credit score. Since I’m a chef, and the hostel is looking for a chef they said I can volunteer while I stay here and cooking is also a past time of mine. 

I’ve also been working on feeling my emotions rather than trying to fight them. Someone stole my wallet from the Hotel I was staying at or maybe I dropped it, it was a gift from a secret admirer who im still don’t know who it is. But it was an LV purse and it had my id and bank cards. I’ve accepted that it maybe gone forever but I’m going to go back to the hotel and see if maybe someone picked it up. That was my first label anything and it’s silly of me to be thinking of materialistic things but I’d hate for the person to show up one day and say “did you get my gift “ and my response is I lost it. 

Anyway, I know I’m VERY lucky, but I guess I wanted to share where I was now. I cleaned up my room and reorganised it as the fengshui of the room wasn’t in flow. I’m going to ask for a little chair for my desk and a mop to further clean my room.

I lost pretty much everything and ended up in a homeless shelter. I had a roof over my head and food, but that was pretty much it. It didn't help that most of the staff had no training in social work. They were hired for their religious beliefs, not because they had experience helping people get back on their feet. They assumed every women there was a heathen, a liar, a thief, an alcoholic, an addict, a threat to society. I got even more depressed. I didn't think I'd ever get out of there.

I ended up staying only 4 months. After I got some rest, I pulled myself together enough to get a good job. Today I'm in my own apartment, with a new (used) car and a new pet. I'm still rebuilding my life and wonder if I'm far enough along with that. And I still struggle with depression, even though I'm back on my meds and have a great counselor.

But at least I'm here instead of on the streets or in a shelter. I'm happy to have a job I enjoy and lets me feel like I'm contributing to society. My apartment is small, but it keeps me safe and sheltered. I'm grateful I was hard-headed enough to not give up. I'm very grateful I have an education that helped me get a high-paying job.

When I just became homeless, I truly believed things would get better. I tried hard to be optimistic about it, but I still fucked up and lost my last job.

I couldn't see a way out of this.

y4b6zr,"Been working at a homeless shelter for almost 2 years and... I am so depressed. I've grown to love my clients. Personally I'm 25 days clean off meth, multiple mental hospital stays and 10+ full time jobs aside from the shelter this year.  My coworkers and clients know I'm an addict but think I've been clean for years. I would 100% be homeless and so would my 3 cats if not for my dad and ex constantly keeping me afloat....

That being said I still dont understand what's with the complete lack of empathy in our programs design. I get the idea but it isnt feasible for many clients. Our time limit to stay is two months. How many of you believe that's fair. We have open beds right now and have all summer and fall. The program operates as if people in active addiction, on disability or both can actually pay off their evictions, get a job, recover, find a roomie who isnt shady? In two months, maybe 3...

We have quite a few who've been thru several two month rounds since I've been. Then we have those who've been banned completely for valid reasons but what will happen to them this winter? I get the feeling other staff feel these issues are out of our hands but I dont agree. 

I plan on staying for the long haul, boosting myself up so I can do more for the ones who struggle most. I'm on thin ice for being the staff that breaks rules to do things extra stuff for people who've already used that resource (giving out too many undies to 1 person for example)

It was the meth addict who moved into the next encampment over until a prostitute stole all of his things and then he went to Venice. Now he's back? Why the fuck is he on a sideway right behind OUR tent if he needs to pee on grass? He doesn't give a shit about COVID and the police station has public bathrooms down the street anyone can walk into...

&#x200B;

He then also gives two more b.s. reasons: that he's helping an elderly womyn get inside and with groceries. It is 4 AM and every supermarket in the fucking county closes by midnight. The elderly Womyn lives ACROSS THE STREET, and gets PARATRANSIT which pulls up AT HER DOOR (And it's a residential intersection. I'm on a fucking parkway.) facing us but across the street. The stairs down have a railing and she physically can't get up them without falling. The paratransit drivers NEVER help her walk to her door. She doesn't buy groceries, she's not even capable of carrying them, but her family members are asleep by the time she gets home and they sleep like rocks. We can hear her call for help whenever she gets back, which is around midnight. We can also hear her when she is talking to people. Why the fuck would she be at someone else's truck with no one else, on our side of the street with a known homeless drug addict? Explain that one.

&#x200B;

I am normally against sweeps, but the activity from my neighbor's encampment is radicalizing me. The main person there brought two druggies over when his situationship person was getting medical treatment in another county. One person was arrested last week and is in jail. The other person is the meth addict who tried to break into the truck, and he kept trying to convince me to take meth ""for weight loss"" 🤮! He only left because a prostitute who was staying at the encampment stole all of his clothes out of his tent. When I tried to give him clothes which were his size which I was given for the purpose of upcycling them, he told me he was in VENICE (Drug mecca for houseless people. One time I ended up being walked to Venice by a weirdo prepandemic because I couldn't get to my storage unit to grab my camping supplies before the gate lockout time so I went to a party at a dungeon which briefly existed in my neighborhood to have somewhere to go and the friend who was letting me stay at their place at times wasn't able to give me a ride to get to them and no one else was that I got stranded and this shady character wouldn't leave me alone when all I wanted to do was walk over to Jack in the Box and just sit there all night for safety... This was the night before I had to go in to be hired by Amazon the first time so I had to keep my clothes nice, and the womyn the guy brought me too called me a ""prissy bitch"" for not wanting to ruin my bottoms which I needed to wear to what might be an interview, and apparently she was waking up to people leaving USED DRUG NEEDLES RIGHT BT HER FACE! The guy wanted to smoke with her and ended up quickly changing attitude and ignoring me after saying they would escort me and make sure nothing happened. I ended up grabbing a Lyft scooter, back when they had the $5 scooter passes for low income people, and scootering to a bus bench in Marina Del Rey in an area I used to work, and laying there in the freezing cold waiting for the first bus I could take back to go into storage for my interview shirt and jacket and to go charge at Starbucks and then get to the hiring location...).

&#x200B;

Days before the prostitute thing, two people who are apparently known for thieving and stealing whatever they can stole my broken mouse poop infested tent from a changeover which I was waiting for LA Sanitation to empty the public trash cans to throw away (The drivers were skipping pickup). I had told everyone else who asked for the tent no because of the sanitation issue and got the one person who actually didn't have a tent in working condition a new tent through a volunteer who distributes tents to people who need it. I ended up getting the people who stole my tent 2 new tents before finding out one of them had housing. So now that they had a tent to use and a tent to sell, they STILL didn't return the old tent until the womyn in a situationship with the main person who camps there told them off (They originally tried to extort my ex for the tent, too. I feel like this is one of those instances where both trying to help people and seeking justice stops or delays them from experiencing karma.), But they filled the tent with LOOSE RAZORBLADES that I got FUCKING INJURED and had to seek medical care!

&#x200B;

Meanwhile the main person who camps there DOES ACTUALLY prostitute/sexually abuse womyn. Apparently one womyn in a yellow dress who isn't all there is being abused by a man who seems to be whoring her out, and she stayed in main person's tent one day. The following day, she spent the ENTIRE DAY tens of feet from the encampment with a cart, just standing around and not doing anything. The ex gave her water, but from what he saw, she was NOT all there. I saw her with the guy a mile down the road days later fighting out in the open. Another womyn had apparently stayed over the previous night. I had seen her before on my way to a dog walking gig earlier that week and she was pretending to do Tai Chi but not doing Tai Chi. I was early so I had to wait a few light cycles and I really needed to drink water, but I got the worst vibes from her. She kept fucking watching me and I had to keep watching her so she wouldn't come up to me. Well apparently the day after she slept with said neighbor in his encampment, she was found in the middle of the rain (Hurricane Kay was at it's closest point to LA, so it rained heavily), and she was just laying there on the ground in the middle of the rain in just shorts and a Tshirt. Apparently she tried going into people's tents including a neighbor just before the problematic encampment and the guy wanted NOTHING TO DO WITH HER (His tent is broken and he doesn't even want to set up the replacement tent because the problem encampment is so problematic, he doesn't want to attract the same attention with the same influx of undesirables or get lumped in there from getting upgraded from what is only a little bit bigger than a Happy Camper tent.), but she was trying because of what he did...

&#x200B;

Every time the situationship womyn leaves temporarily, EVEN FOR A DAY, the main person brings a womyn THE NEXT DAY. One womyn who assaulted her that she has a restraining order against showed up THE DAY after she left. At one point while she was on a medical trip, the main person brought over a womyn for a while who then stole the situationship person's tent and set it up past us to create her own encampment. The main person whose encampment it is I'd a MENACE and THE ENCAMPMENT NEEDS TO GO!

I am also sick of the womyn too. She's an alcoholic and there is a rehab place she can stay at indefinitely in another county. Running water, electricity... But every time she says she is leaving for good, she is back anywhere from days to a week. She practically fake leaves every month. Now because of the meth addicts, it has fucked her up and she acts like she is secondhand affected by meth. I come to find that now she's suffering from high blood pressure and a very high heart rate. Gee, the meth smoke and stress from being there could easily be why... That or diabetes... Meanwhile she acts like she's so attached to this guy who treats her like crap, but he's literally sexually abusing and using womyn. WHO THE FUCK STAYS WITH SOMEONE KEEPING PROSTITUTES OVER? Meanwhile she is having health issues which could easily be from all of the prostitutes... For example, she has an ear infection. My ex used to have chronic ear infections from drooling on the bed. This guy doesn't even clean. One time the womyn bought pizza for the entire encampment, and he opened the pizza box for a slice and LEFT IT OPEN so when she tried to get a slice, there was already a mouse on it! He can't be bothered to clean ANYTHING so she acts like his maid... If he's having strange womyn over, who is to say she didn't get an ear infection off whatever body fluids they got in the bedding? She needs to run away and never come back. I am also tired by how two faced she is. Extremely passive aggressive in group text with advocates, pretends to care about COVID and actively violated all COVID safety protocol when I paid her to help with laundry. She also kept trying to get the meth addicts involved when I told her no that I didn't want to give money to hard drug users. But I am now realizing that drunks count too. I should not be supporting someone as ditzy, flaky, two faced against me, and doesn't even genuinely do the work she is paid to do let alone actually care if I live or die.

She has repeatedly tried to dismiss me as ""but you look healthy"". Bitch, I am just shy of being morbidly obese (I am still metabolically obese and I have been for more than a decade), and I have GENETIC issues and genetically linked chronic health issues that I LITERALLY cannot get vaxxed and am simultaneously high risk for Covid even if I was magically able to get fully vaxxed and boosted. I come from a fucked up genetic line that all of my immediate family members had vaccine reactions and my sister ended up with long COVID where she was CONTINUALLY POSITIVE for 3 months straight less than a year after being vaccinated. She literally couldn't leave her house for 3 months. Her NOT HIGH RISK boyfriend tested negative the entire fucking time while living with her. She is also immunocompromised for a 2/3 out of 1 million genetic condition that is sex linked that there is a 50% chance I have it too and I have had early signs of having as well that there is a good chance I will end up with kidney failure like she has at 35, and possibly liver failure when I don't even drink, it's the genetic disorder.

&#x200B;

At one point the main person kept breaking branches and destroying trees which was fucking up my neighbor's allergies, causing me ex's childhood allergies to come back (They were burning pollen covered pinecones and needles), and we're giving me allergies I NEVER had before! I KNEW when they had fires just by the nose irritation kind of like I know my ex is trying to get away with smoking by smoking outside the tent but I still fucking smell it! When the ex told him no, he physically assaulted the ex. I RECORDED IT, yet the police REFUSED to arrest him and instead spoke my ex out that he thought it was futile and started going along with police which then undermined me when I kept trying to advocate for them to do something!

At work I busted my ass showing up everyday with no breaks working 10-14 hours and waking up the next day to do it again. Some days I’d go hungry just so I could get something to eat for the next day. I work at a gas station that serves food so I’d wait for stuff to go bad and when my store throws them away I’d come back and take them to eat. Emotionally I wasn’t ok. I found myself crying a lot while eating soiled food knowing I could do better soo much better. This isn’t me. I’d be angry some days and others the depression would get so bad I’d get to the edge of just ending myself. But I knew I was above it all. Don’t take this the wrong way but I view myself as a god. It’s stupid I know but I was bullyed so much when I was younger I developed this annoying god complex that although I know how to tell real from fake it was just what I needed so all those times I started driving really fast so I’d crash and die or when I’d go to the beat and just got deep into the sea hoping I’d drown that thought of being a god kept me alive. I finally stopped being so angry all the time and started to focus. I worked so much I ended up in the hospital a few times my feet swollen so bad and I was in so much pain I couldn’t stand but I decided to give myself a break I changed thinking about what I want to do and what I will do to this:
“Just one more day and if I can’t I’ll give up” days turned into weeks. Just one more day. Weeks turned into months. Just one more day. With all I’ve been though and the emotions and struggles, I don’t feel strong hell I still can’t believe it’s gotten to the point where I can breathe but I’ll say this, if your feeling down, at your breaking point, no one to turn to and your just can’t anymore. Keep struggling for one more day.

I got fired from the restaurant some days ago because of some bullshit reason. The owner says I'm not working hard enough and I often show up late ( I only showed up late two times in two months and it was not longer than 20mins). So anyway, I'm right back to square one. I have no place to stay because the library called the police one night and they escorted me out of the building. The police said if he see me one more time he will arrest me for trespassing. I don't know if trespassing works for the public library but I don't want trouble. So I'm on the street now, shivering in the darkness and cold wind.

But what is the most help an individual can do to help the homeless? I’m a young woman living in a big city so I don’t feel safe interacting with strange men on my own, homeless or not, outside of safe spaces which makes this a little harder because otherwise I would give rides.

I hate that people only give the homeless food cause they “don’t want them to spend it on drugs” it seems like equating a homeless person to a stray animal. 

I want to help homeless people in a way that treats them like humans and gives them autonomy so I figure the best way to go about this is to ask people who are homeless and who have been homeless. 

Are bus passes, 24/7 gym memberships, a phone, things like that helpful? I’m trying to think of things that fix the problem of being homeless in the first place, not just treat the side effects of it. What I mean by this is I want to do more than just hand homeless people food and money.

y1o9j1,"Looking for feedback on a website design to replace 211 and current resource distribution systems. Hello! I have experience in public policy and have some experience being homeless myself. I've had this idea for a while and someone graciously offered to code it up, it's going to be part of the next advocacy project I launch. Please let me know your thoughts. I will use constructive criticisms to change the design before it gets made. It’s one chapter in a draft of a book I wrote up so it might be a little messy. 

TLDR: The website would have a linkable and searchable glossary on definitions of services, a filtered services search engine, optional accounts, and messaging and document sharing for communicating with case managers, for those of you that don’t have phones. 

**Section A: Base set of Definitions.**

When you hear the word ‘supportive living services’ what comes to mind? 

I’ve found many case managers think of a housing program where clients are assigned a case manager and/or a therapist.

Supportive Living Services are actually the customized support someone typically with developmental differences receives in the residence of their choice- which isn’t necessarily a housing program.

For example, a person with autism lives in their own apartment, and a supportive living staff member comes by in the mornings on an as-needed basis to help them get ready for work and plan meals. Services are customized, so when they are doing well they might not use services very often, and when they are not doing well they might need support for a longer portion of the day every day.

When someone is trying to find a service, it’s important that everyone is on the same page about what they’re looking for. 

In some situations, people know what they need, but don’t know what the name of that type of service is. It can be difficult to find what it’s called if you don’t have the words to search it up.

Having a base set of definitions and descriptions of what different services are called can help people seeking services and service providers get on the same page on what a person’s needs are.

It could also help people learn about services that they didn’t know existed, and find services that fit their needs better. 

For example someone might try getting EBT hot meal benefits, but not know that a home delivery meal program exists and they qualify for it.

The base set of definitions needs to be organized by type of service such as food, housing, healthcare, and other categories that would allow people looking for services to find what solution would best fit them. 

A base set of definitions could also be shared with and used by other communities to identify their own community needs and opportunities. 

**Section B: Search Engine**

People would be able to search for services a few ways:

\-They could enter the name of the type of service as seen in the glossary 

\-They could enter their situation by filling out a demographic/intake questionnaire filter and get search results for all services that they may need, or may be available to them.

\-They could search for information about services using filters on the Effective Resource List, seen below. 

\-People could also search for all the services automatically available to them based on statuses such as recipients of SSI/SSDI, EBT, or Calworks. 

Trying to collect data on what communities need can take years and solutions are often far later. The search engine would collect data on what community needs are in real time, so organizations and policy makers can respond quickly. 

For services that are closed to new clients, when people go to exit out of the page a popup could ask people to choose from a few options, including “I need this service, please fund this” and “I’m just browsing” 

**Section C: Effective Resource List**

(This is what the search results would look like. The original draft contains an abridged version of this list as well.)

In this article I’ve described a service design that would replace intakes. The list below is designed for people creating resource lists for their own communities, as a way to help spread the information that matters most. 

1. Program Type 

As defined in the glossary.

1. Program Name
2. Provider

If the organization is really small, it may be the same name. 

1. City/Location

Include all relevant addresses. It is important to differentiate a business office between the location the services are provided. 

1. Hours of operation. 

It’s important to differentiate between the hours the services are open and the hours the office is open. For smaller organizations this may be the same. 

1. A detailed description of what the services are and who provides them

This is relevant when the services offered are a little different than the glossary definition. Saying who the services are offered by is relevant when the services are provided by community partners. This helps anticipate how much support will be or is available, as partner-based services may not be available depending on independent waiting lists, contracts, or legal issues. 

1. Eligibility requirements

These are the requirements people must meet in order to be accepted into the program. \*\*\*It’s important for services to remove eligibility requirements when possible so people can access services preventatively.\*\*\*

1. Cost to participant and/or insurance accepted 

This is an important one to search for on the search engine.

1. Requirements to stay enrolled 

These are the requirements people must meet to not get kicked out of the program. 

1. Waiting list 

This would indicate if there is a waiting list, and the waiting list length time based on the longest amount of time a person will wait before entering the program. If the waiting list's wait time is dependent on individual circumstances, then add a statement that explains who priority enrollment goes to. 

1. What the intake process is. 

Different programs have different intake processes. 

1. Contact information for the intake coordinator. 
2. Contact information for at least one other staff member. 

This is important when contact information changes, employee turnover, and sick leave/vacation time.

1. Funding source

This is relevant for people who are already in other programs, so they know which additional services they can receive without encountering double billing issues. 

1. Contact for filing a grievance. 

This information is listed in the program’s intake paperwork. Most people can’t find this fine print, including a program’s own employees.

1. Accessibility 

Accessibility includes wheelchair accessibility, languages spoken, and proximity to public transportation routes. 

1. Outbreak policies and risk level. 

Depending on what type of program it is, there are higher and lower chances of how transmissible an illness is. This is relevant for general outbreaks and future pandemics, and this information is especially important for immunocompromised people.

1. Date the information was last updated. 

A large amount of information on resource lists is outdated. Having a date can let people expect how many resources will still be relevant. For resourcing organizations, it’s important to update regularly.

**Section D: Accounts**

It would be important for people to be able to make accounts- especially those with frequent, consistent, fluctuating, or higher needs. 

The idea behind this website with an account is that it would consolidate every person’s needs across different sectors and systems within sectors. The search engine would help people find what they qualify for based on their situation and needs, while an account would help those with changing situations and needs update and keep track of what services are available to them and what services they’ve already tried. 

Creating an account would serve multiple purposes: 

1. It would replace program intakes.

A person could enter in all their information, and be able to see what programs they qualify for and what services are available. They would have the option to send their intake form to these organizations. This would replace program intake processes. 

2. It would help coordinate care and communicate with multiple agencies at once. 

There would be a space for people to electronically sign ROI’s, and staff at different organizations would be able to delegate and prioritize responsibilities and needs. Everyone would be able to give and get updates in real time. The account would both be a method of contact, and allow clients to update their methods of contact. They would also have the ability to add notes if the service they were connected to doesn’t work out, so social workers can get a better idea of what services would be more accessible, or the client would feel comfortable reaching out again if their situation changed. 

3. It would help identify needs. 

If they know what service they need, they could enter a service type as seen in definitions. If they aren’t sure and don’t have the bandwidth to find the name of it, they could write a description to give social workers a better idea of what they are looking for.

It’s also important to note what they were originally looking for. If the service they need isn’t available, (unfortunately all too common) they might have to make up for it by combining two or three other services. If case managers don’t know what the goal is, it can look bad on the outside if the client isn’t showing up or accepting services they asked for previously. 

Clients could also identify their needs with a ‘needs checklist’, where they could click on a label for needs they are missing and currently seeking a solution for.

See section E for more details. 

4. It would allow clients to opt in and opt out of services within an organization. 

Services would be based on client/staff relationships that were a good fit. The term ‘good fit’ is common when describing client/therapist relationships, but it also applies to case managers, employment specialists, etc. It’s important to note that when someone is seeking services, they aren’t looking for a person with a standard job title. They are looking for someone who cares enough to do their job well- someone who understands them. 

When clients decide who to see from what program, not only are they gaining agency, but resources are used more effectively- funding and billing would only happen based on the actual amount services are used, and services can be redirected to better meet the need. This is especially important for mental health services that provide medication- we are in a national psychiatrist shortage, and we can’t afford mental health programs that require medication to those not interested when people who both want and need medication are desperate for appointments. 

The website can be set up in a way that is organized by agencies, but used by clients that would incentivize market competition to provide the best services possible. 

There’s been many times when agencies just aren’t providing the services described in the intake. The reasons vary: partners backed out on the contract, ongoing legal settlements, but the most common issue is staff shortages due to low wages and micromanaging bosses. In other words, the exact same issues that every single industry experiences. It begs the question: where is the unused money for these programs going?

5. It would allow clients to see their file.

If clients had the ability to see their file, they would be better able to see and confirm the accuracy of information written on their file. Clients can report whether service providers are providing them services or not.

**Section E. Identifying Needs** 

An account can allow people to identify what they need, and coordinate with multiple social workers. 

An easy way to do this is with Maslow’s Circle of Needs. It’s an alternative to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which was criticized for its hierarchical structure. Different people prioritize their need differently. An example of this is the “starving artist”, whose need for self-actualization is more important than their need for food. 

People could click on a label for needs they are missing and currently seeking a solution for. If they know what they need, they could enter a service type as seen in definitions. If they aren’t sure and don’t have the bandwidth to find the name of it, they could write a description. 

It’s also important to note what they were originally looking for. If the service they need isn’t available, (unfortunately all too common) they might need to make up for it by combining two or three other services. If case managers don’t know what the goal is, it can look bad on the outside if the client isn’t showing up or accepting services they asked for previously. 

(people might have a large amount of needs, but there does need to be goal prioritization) 

The easiest needs checklist can be done with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. People could indicate what needs they are missing and currently seeking a solution for. Someone might have a large amount of needs, but there does need to be goal prioritization

Here is a sample list of needs, based on Maslow’s need hierarchy. I did add and adjust the list to make more sense in the context of services.

Water

Food

Sleep

Toileting 

Medications 

Healthcare 

Air Quality 

Transportation 

Income/Finances 

Employment 

Internet/Technology 

Education

Community/Social Connection 

Safety

I thankfully have some friends that had a small space for me and an air mattress. I have to pay a few hundred a month. My mom however doesn't have anyone but me and I don't have anything more to give aside from what I have which was literally everything. 

Neither of us have had the means to save and this blows. She can't go to a shelter because of her new jobs. If they found out, she'd get fired. We can't pay for a hotel and I'm at a loss for what to do. I tried to ask my friends if she could at least stay tonight on the couch but they said no. While I understand it just made me devastated. I'm so worried now that she doesn't have a phone and her job won't allow her to work right now with whatever illness is going on. She's dying or could die and I'm scared and she's scared and we're both overwhelmed and stressed out. I thought after all this time I'd be stronger, that we'd be in a better place but we take one step forward and freaking 30 steps back. I don't even know what advice to ask for. I just want things to be okay.

Recently the topic of Idealism vs Realism has been coming up in my conversations a lot. I embrace my ability to be the idealist that’s always looking at the silver lining. I suppose to some that could come across as arrogant/delusional.

I am a present being, granted I have fixated on my past ALOT and it’s been to my detriment. It’s just that, I’m the future I get to choose to be in a state of positive expectation.

xyk99h,"GAH! I don't have enough money to make any money!! Full disclosure, I'm no longer homeless and haven't been for about a year now.  But I was not too long ago.

Before the pandemic I was pretty successful.  However without addiction or mental illness, I still ended up homeless for a year.  Just bad financial decisions in conjunction with the pandemic got me there.

Now I'm not homeless anymore, but I still can't get anywhere close to making anywhere near the money I used to.  I simply never have enough money to wait the 3-8 weeks financial companies take to hire you!  I always have to take shitty jobs that pay way, WAY below my grade, experience and degree simply because crappier jobs hire much faster.  They pay shitty though so it's hard to save especially with this inflation.  Can't save, so I never have the several weeks worth of expenses that it would take for me to wait on a good job.

1- Applied to a private equity firm and two weeks later they called me for an interview.  Then they asked me to come in for a 2nd interview scheduled a week later.  That's 3 weeks of waiting - and that's without getting officially hired which probably would've taken another 1-2 weeks.  By the time the 2nd interview came up I was too hard up for cash and had to apply to a minimum wage place that would hire me the next day.  That better paying job was going to have to wait.

2- Applied to a dream job with killer benefits.  After 2 interviews I was given a tentative job offer... only to have to turn it down because the job required a whole LIST of background checks, fingerprinting etc, that they told me would take at **least** 2 extra weeks to finish!  I couldn't wait anymore than I already had.  Needed money so again I applied to another low paying gig and got the job same day and got my first paycheck only 2 days later.

3- Applied to another financial firm and same story..  Took 3 weeks to go through 3 interviews and I had to take those days off work to do the interviews... They told me they wanted to do a 4th interview with ""the entire team this time"" and I had to pass.... I just couldn't afford taking another day off work.  So back I went to my much too low paying job that I new would give me a quick paycheck.

I have the skills.  I have the experience.   But I can't wait long enough to go through all the interviews and wait to be *possibly* hired.   It's a catch 22.  I don't have the money to be able to wait those things out and the reason I don't have the money is because I have to get fast hiring jobs that don't pay well.... which causes me to not have the money... and round and round I've gone like that for almost a year now.  For almost a year I've been on this never ending shit wheel of not being able to get off these minimum wage-low paying gigs because the higher paying jobs that I'm qualified for don't hire fast enough.

So I was staying at a place in Baltimore where I was working but that project ended. I had a few hundred bucks, and decided to buy some camping gear and rough it until I get back on my feet. On Thursday I start a job detailing cars. I bought nite cat water proof hammock tent, which can be used as both a waterproof hammock and a small tent. I got a 38 liter interior frame hiking backpack. Wanted a bigger one but this one was only ten bucks. Pocket sized propane stove for 12 bucks from Walmart, 2 1 lb cans of propane. Small canteen kit with mini kettle, pot, plate, and cutlery.  An adapter so I can fill my small propane tanks with a big tank. A hurricane lamp and half gallon of kersone, for a cheap heat source. I have 3 led lights, 2 flashlights and one small flood light. Sleeping bag rated for 35 degrees, needs to be upgraded. 20k mah power source for phone. Tiny little camp stool. 550 Paracord, a hatchet, leather work gloves, hammer Yoga mat as under pad, was all I could find. To move around I have a gravel bike with large saddle bags. 

I have a black card membership to planet fitness, so I can exercise and take showers. 

I'm thinking I need a good coat, right now I just have a jacket, a 20 lb propane tank, and maybe a few gallons of water when I find my ""homebase."" And a couple tarps and some stakes. Eventually a small 10 or 15 watt solar panel. 

I'm not actually from Baltimore. Just came here to get a fresh start. I know I'll be straight with a couple months of work under belt. I don't really have any bills beside cell phone and planet fitness, I should be able to bank quite a bit
 Anyway, in the meantime, what resources does Baltimore have for homeless people? I just applied for food stamps. Anyone know where I can set up camp at? An abandoned house would be the best as far as shelter, but can't I get arrested doing that? I was thinking of setting up a camp on the outskirts of the city somewhere in some wooded area.

I've been homeless in NYC shelters and drop in centers for a long time as well as subletting rooms, staying with people I know, sleep on kitchen floor of old job, etc., and considering car living as an option (yes, I know it's cold).  I've been on disability for 8 years due to cancer and started working a remote job two months ago in the hope I could get an apartment but the rents have gone up 40% in the last year and I still can't afford anything, and at this point feel it would be less traumatic to sleep in a car somewhere than to go back to the shelter or continue subletting from horrible people who are just as likely to throw me out when they feel like it, steal my shit for drug money, or all the other things that have happened over the years.  I don't want to stay within the city due to the inevitable parking issues and likelihood of abuse from the police, but I need to stay close to the city since my job requires me to be within an hour and a half of the office and occasionally come in.

xpbzvf,"A free ticket to a better life Would anybody like to read a story? I’m assuming if you’re here you might be cramped up laying in the back of your car, laying on a bench, sitting outside of a building or in a tent. Hungry. Maybe you’ve escaped this pitfall of life, or maybe you’re just interested in the issue.

I was homeless for a year. An entire year! Now, many people are homeless for longer than that. By in large I would guess that the majority of these people will be terminally homeless. This could be due to a variety of issues. There are those who have genuine health issues; mental cognitive disorders or otherwise that prevent them from ever being able to have a job. There are addicts, and I’ve seen and lived with addiction and I know the difficulties. But at the end, that too is a choice. 

But then there are others who are just lazy. I know this because I’ve seen them. I’ve met them and talked with them. I’ve sat under bridges while it was raining and on benches in the respite of the cool weather Spring brings. Some of these people have nothing wrong with them besides whatever complex they are constructing to rationalize and shift blame off of themselves. That was me too.

For a whole year I felt genuinely hopeless. That despair is something nobody should have to feel. But in the world we live in, you are responsible for yourself. I finally came to this conclusion. And then? I did the unthinkable. I did the thing people here would shun you for! They will tell you it’s a horrible idea! Why? I guess because there’s a preconception of it being difficult, and people are lazy.

I joined the military. Man was it worth it. After a handful of short months of training I was stationed in the place all the homeless dream of coming to. Not only that, I was on perhaps some of the most beautiful real estate in all of Southern California. Not only that, it was FREE! For four years! Not just the housing; the food, clothes, training. All free. In fact, I even got paid for it. 

Now if I go up to just about any homeless person and tell them that they could get PAID to live in housing, with free food, and free job training, they would of course agree. 

But of course not everyone can join the military. Some do have disqualifying medical conditions. Some do have a record. Some may be too old. But for those who can, and wouldn’t, and would instead choose to sleep on the street, shit in a ditch, and shower in a gas station bathroom using the sink. Well, for those people, you’re choosing to be homeless. It’s really that simple. 

I was homeless for a year. After 4 years of being smart with my money and bettering myself as a person, I’m now enrolled at a prestigious university undertaking a paramedic training program slated to find a job in the market paying 6 figures. The military sucked a lot. Nobody who served in any branch will tell you otherwise. But depending on which branch you choose, the suck is minimal and the payoff at the end of it all is life changing. 

I just wish people here would quit dismissing the military or say it’s a bad idea. It changes so many lives for the better(and granted, some for the worse. don’t go into combat arms and you’ll be okay).

Much love and good luck",treyj88,0,1,8,1024

I searched this sub to see if anyone had asked this before and I didn’t have much luck. If I’m breaking any rules I’m unaware of, I apologize ahead of time and I will remove this post. 

A little background:
I just moved to a metropolitan area after being born and raised in a small town states away. My hometown disgust me, as it’s the norm to treat anyone homeless without any sort of respect. I grew up in a family with this mentality as well, and needless to say, I’m thankful I no longer live there and I can now start giving back to those who need it most without getting yelled at by passerby’s and family _just_ for being human. Thankfully, the homeless population in my home town is small to begin with, and it seems people are breaking this mentality as we speak. 

I’m wanting to put together a kit as I’ve mentioned, and here’s what I’m thinking to include in it. I wanted to drop in here and ask for some feedback, in case any of the items I have in mind aren’t actually practical and could be replaced with someone more practical. Here goes:

• A small bag or backpack to store all items in the kit

• Snack packs and other non-perishable foods, such as ramen, cracker and tuna packs, granola bars, etc.

• Unscented deodorant, tooth paste & toothbrush

• Warm socks and gloves, and hopefully some liner socks and gloves too (We live in snowy conditions)

• Emergency warming blanket and/or warm poncho 

• refillable water bottle 

• Wet wipes and/or bathing wipes 

• pen and note pad

• laminated list of resources in the area with numbers and addresses 

There may have been a few things I’ve left out, but these are the main items I’m working on getting in bulk at the moment. If anyone has any items that you think I should add to the kits, I’ll be more than happy to follow through with any suggestions. 

It might be a few months before I am able to start putting these kits together as I’m a recent grad who is still searching for employment in my new city. Many people, such as my parents back in my hometown, are not in favor of my partner and I doing this, their main reason being that we are young adults just getting started in our careers and we need to think of ourselves and only ourselves. This has made it just a tad harder to get started on, but there’s no way I’d let the outdated mentality of my parents stop me from helping those who happen to be in a homeless situation. Screw that mentality. We are all humans deserving of basic necessities, and that’s exactly why I want to do this. The resources in my new city are pretty decent, but they can’t reach everyone. Not that I will be able to reach everyone either, but something is just calling me to be _that_ person. I hope I’ve made some sense with my background and why I’ve chose to help out. Another thing that somewhat disgust me is seeing people helping out someone who is in a homeless situation, just for internet points. My phone most likely won’t be anywhere near me when I’m able to start giving the kits. It is possible to help someone out simply because they need it, and not for personal gain or internet points. That is something I’ve learned since moving to a city that cares about all their residence, whether they have a house or not. 

Any suggestions for the items in the kits or how to go about distributing them is very much appreciated!!

xgtah5,"Lack of compassionate people out there, be careful... People make assumptions about the homeless community, such as that drugs led y'all down this path. They don't realize that aging out of the foster care system is an actual thing plus the large lgbtq+ homeless community that got kicked out for who they are. Or the fact that our medical care system is broken. Access to medical services to help people suffering from mental illness is not always feasible. What they don't realize is that they're one paycheck themselves from facing the very same thing. 

I have been arguing with multiple people online about this and it's insane how so many could hold that same view about the community. They lack compassion. Not one person has come to my defense.

It seems to me that we need to get the homeless into those two categories those that want to be homeless and those that don't then we can help those that don't and try to understand those that do.

xfu09n,"Currently homeless and my experience and thought as a Black 22m I just been recently kicked out the my ex friends place due to getting into a fight cuz he was off drugs and demanding money for 2k (the game).

This isn’t my first time being homeless, when i was 18 i was kicked out the house for a month  by my grandparents so that can teach me a lesson, knowing i was homeless before moving in with them after taking me in off the streets when i was 15 homeless living with my family (1 sibling and 2 dogs). 

Being homeless through out my life has taught me a lot and also traumatized me affecting me mentally and socially.
Prime example was when i was 7th-9th grade i was living in a single bed weekly motel room with 4 people, accompanied by a million roaches. i was afraid to be seen where i was staying at so i was alone with no friends other than my younger brother

Currently i’ve been homeless for the past 3 wks now , i do work and get paid weekly but i came to the conclusion is it’s hard to save when u have nothing. so i sacrifice spending money on hotels .i don’t have a license or car so i don’t have the benefit of sleeping in a car but i will eventually. When i’m not at work i try to find a place with wi-fi to save data and entertainment. what helped me was the local library. i work graveyard shifts so i can be up at night so by the morning when i get off i can chill at the library

As for sleeping arrangements, i don’t have anything really my first two wks was me sleeping on the bathroom floor of a gym in my ex apartment complex. Until i got confronted by one of the maintenance people staring people complained that i was chilling at the apt complex bench for to long and it scared them. But as of last night i slept near a gated dumpster with no shame. i cover myself head to toe to protect me from mosquitoes.

Though times are hard, but ik if i put in pain and buss my ass that i’ll be able to afford my own place with a roommate atleast. Some how i don’t feel really depressed about it. surprisingly i have some kind of inner peace. I try to stay positive because i hate to be a downer and make people feel sorry for me.

The housing market is absolutely shit rn. Apartments and houses costing more than a brand for a single bedroom.

I make 1.2k a month or about 1.4k depends on the hours I receive.

I had just received surgery a while ago and I'm in medical debt as well.

I called shelters and multiple apartment owners. They're all on waiting lists and at full capacity. Even affordable income based apartments are also at full capacity and aren't available. I live in Florida and a lot of other apartments or housing is only available for seniors over the age of 55. I've been denied because of low income even though they have scammed me out of application fees and other shit which doesn't make sense to me how someone can have low income to the extent where they can't afford housing but they're able to afford stupid application fees that are non refundable if you're denied. 

Anyways I would get a second job but I struggle with transportation. I've been assaulted on the bus before I don't do well with that. I try to walk everywhere but the weather in Florida and just the climate on earth in general has gotten ridiculously bad and too hot. I would have been able to walk to work for an hour like 4 years ago but I can't do that anymore.

HOBO: one who travels (mainly by freight) and works gig jobs

Homebum: the stereotypical homeless person, doesn't travel, never leaves the same place, usually strung out
Homeguard: like a homebum, but doesn't panhandle,  instead works, sometimes they are retired HOBOs, other times never traveled, and doesn't have a drug problem

 Contrary to popular belief,  most homeless people I have known are not addicts, with the exception of a homebum, I seen more drug use and addiction amongst rich affluent folks then homeless, the only reason why drug addiction is stereotyped with homeless is because homeless folks have no walls to hide behind,  most rigs you find on the ground in major cities are from rich folks,  and of course, homeless get blamed....",Obeone616,9,1,8,1024
x9hhkb,"Gentrification and the Homeless Gentrification is a good thing only if a city has spare housing and here's why... 

There will always be poor people and misfits and they need and deserve a place to live too. For example; When a city condemns an old rundown seedy, drug and crime-infested hotel every person in that hotel becomes homeless. Every city needs a seedy part of town for the poor and misfits to live in. If you clean up your seedy part of town as every city in Calif and other states are doing you will have an explosion of homeless and having developers set aside for affordable housing don't work for they don't want to live with you in your neighborhood they would rather be among themselves but not in a tent city next to a creek. I have watched Calif slowly do this over the past 35- 40 years and now enough of you have moved to Nevada where you are doing the exact same thing... Pointing out one hotel after another calling them crime and drug infested and saying something needs to be done about this... NO! nothing needs to be done about this there will always be a percentage of the population like this and they need and deserve a place to live too. You are not going to change human behavior by taking their homes away. Sacramento went so far as to outlaw people living in hotels or Single Room Occupancy (SRO) as they call them. How's that for compassion? And every person in the 1,000's hotel rooms they condemned and tore down moved into a tent down by the river where they are to this day. 

You know, the leaders of cities like SF and Sac have excellent Ivy League speech writers whose words overflow with compassion but ring hollow in action.

He didn’t harass me, he complimented my ruck sack and struck up a conversation about nothing in particular, essentially small talk.

I told him, I grew up in the city of which this conversation took place. But I’m currently homeless.. when I say this officer went from casual conversation, to a solid bro is an understatement. He asked me if I wanted help, I said I did. He didn’t ask what put me on the streets, he didn’t ask me why I don’t work, he didn’t ask me why my family wouldn’t help. He just helped. He got on the phone, secured me a bed. Told me he would be back in a couple hours to pick me up and drop me off.. I was scared but I agreed. He came back a couple hours later, with Chinese food in hand and a ride to a shelter. I am now safe off the streets, I have job interviews tomorrow. I eat 3 times a day with as much seconds as I can manage. I get rides to doctors appointments, I can take showers and shave. I no longer stress.

I am AFAB, pre EVERYTHING. 24/7 camping is in effect. I have ADHD and I am fasting so my sugar is low.

Today I went into storage to declutter because I am a hoarder and I haven't been able to do a clean out since late 2019 due to problems with the building managers, being high risk for Covid.  My solar powered light die so I went to slip it in the front window panel of my tent (The lights at my storage facility turn off every 15 minutes. I also have astigmatism and am legally blind. I need the light.).

We'll, when I turned around I realized the back window was halfway open because I was overheated from all the effort this morning. Someone biked by on a scooter. I panicked, so it took more than a second of them staring for me to cover myself.


I am so ashamed. For one, me being visibly topless as an AFAB makes me seem like the crazy person when I am already camping with the ex and experiencing DV. He gaslights and deadnames me constantly. He was part of the reason why I couldn't transition at all while I was housed.

This group is more shrouded in secrecy but (I hate to sound like a broken record but I personally seen “guests” at GEO Re-Entry Services sporting the gear and referencing them frequently so it was a huge tip off…)

This group more than others is active in the urban community. Which I see as extremely detrimental to the minorities in San Francisco. One huge indicator that they’re police is the gun buy back they do with SFPD. Most of these dudes claim to be ex-cons yet they’re handling firearms (which even a bullet can get you a 10 year violation) with the gosh dang police.

I mean its obvious shit like the gun buy back that makes me feel like Morpheus & I’m the one of the few people on earth whose unplugged from the Matrix.

[Western Addition Career Center on Fillmore in San Francisco](https://bit.ly/3cnNytc) is an advertised “community outreach & job center” but it does staff individuals from United Playaz. After speaking with the fellow there I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt yet even after saying I was on federal probation he tried to upsell me on taking a job in the cannabis industry. I can’t begin to tell you how potentially detrimental that is to a person on federal probation. No matter how you feel about jazz cabbage the fact of the matter is its still federally illegal and (if you’re on federal paper) could potentially end with you getting a new charge.

United Playaz keeps a pretty low profile but if you end up caught in THEIR web your goose is pretty much cooked.

A question that you may be asking yourself is “OK crazy man if everyone in San Francisco is a cop where are they all staying huh? Easy, enter SRO!

What these places allegedly are is renovated cheap hotels converted into long term living. Basically a permanent hotel room. To further help cover things they’re given press such as “programs to assist the homeless”, “sober living facilities” or “post incarceration services”.

But as a person whose A. homeless B. recently released & C. an alleged former drug user I’ll tell you now there was no openings anywhere for me. Even the ones, where they said 6 to 8 month waiting period to get accepted, haven’t contacted me. Even after the “waiting period” has came and went. Yet the alleged drug addict bent over at the waist all day suddenly disappears every night to some form of lodging every night.

This location is literally across the street from GEO Re-Entry Services. It’s primarily a training center geared towards anything tech related.

It didn’t help that Stanley Williams Senior kept trying to upsell me on heading over there.

This was presented to me as a spot I would be able to succeed. But very quickly it turned into yet another Hell On Earth. From the beginning I let the case manager (Daisy Gonzalez) know of the abuses & harassment I suffered through at GEO Re-Entry Services. After a 5 minute or so recap of 111 Taylor Street (GEO Re-Entry Services) Daisy Gonzalez shakes her head like she understands reassures me that The Norma Hotel is much different then immediately puts me into a room with Rooz(beh) a dude who was in a room quite literally across the hall from mine at GEO Re-Entry Services.

Rooz(beh) is a dude I would catch following me around GEO Re-Entry Services & later on the street.

*Rooz(beh) isn’t hard to miss but at least around me he never said very much. He just kind of slithers to & fro looking for his next bust. He’s about 5’7 or so with a bad case of male pattern baldness.*

This location is not hard to miss as it's about a block or so from 24th Street BART. However they have cameras outside of the location *but it's full of la juda* (the police).

wuftzo,"Never Get Comfortable. It may seem harsh. It may seem crazy, but please please never get comfortable when you're at someone's house. Whether it's a friend, a family member, or a spouses place.

You will gain expectations. You will gain expectations that these people actually care about you. I've learned the hard way. I've learned that the only person who could ever care about you is yourself.

If someone gives you a few nights to spend at their place, don't get comfortable. Don't sleep in, Don't feel welcome. Your only purpose there is to have a place to sleep. Get up and get out there. Go to work. Even if you don't have a job, just get out of their way up until it's time for you to lay your head again.

wnq8d4,"Might: Run for some office in town. I experienced six months of homelessness roughly three or four years ago.

I've been out there. I slept in my tiny car, which I was incredibly thankful to have until I totalled it right after landing a bed at a group home, under the hospital floodlights to avoid getting attacked. ""Slept"" is a bit of an exaggeration. It was cold. It was winter. I'd wake up with my toes freezing, then turn on the engine for a moment to warm up real quick.

Luckily, the car was efficient on gas. Unfortunately, I'd burned a lot of bridges with my family, so I had little help on the way.

I got a food stamps card within the first couple days. Thankfully, they expedited mine. I mainly subsisted on the $1 loaves of Walmart bread (gimme that everything bread, baby), whatever I could just peel and eat, and the $1 ten piece nuggets from Burger King, which are no longer only $1.

Running for office or something, the plan is to put my name and ""FOR [OFFICE]"" on crumpled cardboard signs in permanent marker block letters because I will advocate for the rights of homeless people who need housing, healthcare, childcare, employment rehabilitation, and other things.

We're going for full coverage around town.

I do not have a car 

I will bus it everywhere.

she's still in surgery, but here's the outcome so far

-right hip is shattered
-bottom vertebrae is crushed
-left leg the calf and ankle are broken; knee shattered
-right leg solid break to her thigh bone
-right shoulder is shattered
-left arm is dislocated
-heavy gash on forehead
-possible brain trauma

I've talked to the police and investigators. as it stands the woman who hit her was driving approximately 65/mph in a 45/mph zone. they are charging her w a felony hit and run. she ABSOLUTELY hit her head on and according to witnesses she flew right over the car and landed behind the guard rail. the woman didn't even bother to stop or anything. if i see that bitch, I'll kill her w my bare hands and use my last bit of oxygen doing it. 

when i showed up to the hospital they still haven't found her. apparently the person who was driving beside her (it's a 4 lane roadway) got behind her and was able to get half her tag info and car type when she called the cops. they haven't told me who the person was yet, but they are trying to locate her. 

now i wait. and I'm praying. and bartering w God. if you hafta take one off us, I'll gladly take her spot. I've lived a pretty good life. I'm still asking for prayer donations and positive vibes. i know we're all strangers here, but i firmly believe in the power of positive thoughts!

and to the person who accused me of being shitty and making a post for *money* i hope you NEVER have to go through this. either the comment got deleted or something, but i still got the notification in my email. i hope you know how disgusting YOU are making it sound like i would make up this entire Ludacris story to get a few fucking dollars. you're the gross one for even thinking a MOTHER would even concoct that for money.

Today I feel better. The work doesn't feel that overwhelmed anymore. I just put on my headphone and just start washing dishes and mobbing the floor, preparing ingredients for the cook. Afternoon I can have some break and smoke a cigarette then start work again. 

The day ends really fast when you try not to feel.

Before I realize anything I'm on the bus. I looked around and everybody looks tired, I could see it from their back views. There were full bus of people yet it's dead silent in there. Only thing I can hear is the roaring of the engine, even the engine sounds like it needs a break. Everyone is looking at different directions so that no one would have to look at each other.

Everyone is looking at different directions, even though they are feeling the same kind of pain. The pain of surviving in this cruel world, the world that winner wins all and the others get swallowed and threw into the darkness.

Listings for different resources are listed here and in the comment section concerning food, clothing, housing, telecommunications, medical insurance and meds, finance, instructional YouTube videos, sexual health services, and more. This guide has been updated as of Sept. 2022. By clicking on my username you can see what I have written for others. Call your local county social services office ([https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services](https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services)) as soon as possible. United Way's 2-1-1 phone number can give listings for different assistance services in your area. Some local cities may have  municipality level housing services, but you will have to check the local city government website. Out of food, shelter, and clothing housing is always the most difficult to secure. Once you are on one assistance program, such as Medicaid, then it is much easier to get help from other assistance programs.

Eviction prevention might get you some help for one or two months. Next, look at temp agencies for a job. Quick signup for jobs can be found at [bluecrewjobs.com](https://bluecrewjobs.com), [instawork.com](https://instawork.com), and [coolworks.com](https://coolworks.com) (national park jobs with some listings having housing as a benefit). Some large temp agencies are People Ready ([peopleready.com](https://peopleready.com)), Labor Ready ([laborready.com](https://laborready.com)), Adecco ([adeccousa.com](https://adeccousa.com)), and Labor Finders ([laborfinders.com](https://laborfinders.com)). Other temp agency names can be found at [https://www.thesmbguide.com/staffing-agencies](https://www.thesmbguide.com/staffing-agencies). You can get quick acceptance to do warehouse work by signing up with a temp agency and showing up at a shift. Some temp agencies have a bus to take workers to a work site. Some shifts start at 4 or 5 am. Those who get to a temp agency first in a day are the most likely to get a paid shift regardless of time of day to pick from. You can also work at Walmart if you do not have permanent address. You can find job training opportunities via state workforce departments. Departments by State are found at [https://www.naswa.org/membership/workforce-agencies](https://www.naswa.org/membership/workforce-agencies). Apprenticeships may also be found at [https://www.apprenticeship.gov/](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/).

The most important immediate actions to do today are to have your government ID, a SSN card ([https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/)), an official birth certificate ([https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm)), and any passport in your possession. You can go  to a local bank and rent a safety deposit box to keep some of those things secured from theft. In case you are without a permanent address you can get General Delivery from the U.S. Post Office with information at [https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery). Ask the local postmaster at a readily accessible post office near you that you think you will frequently use. Locations are at [https://tools.usps.com/find-location.htm](https://tools.usps.com/find-location.htm). Having General Delivery will be how you get government documents, like medical insurance and SNAP cards, from assistance programs if you are without an address or shelter. You can also use that post office's address on your government ID as a mailing address and job applications.

Websites for sending faxes are [faxzero.com](https://faxzero.com) and [gotfreefax.com](https://gotfreefax.com). There are limits to how many free faxes are sent a day. Fax Zero allows up to five faxes at three pages per day. Got Free Fax is up to two faxes with three pages each. The app called Adobe Fill & Sign is available for Android or Apple phone devices. It is a useful app where forms can be filled in saved as a PDF file. This PDF file can then be sent as a fax via the referenced websites. App is at [https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/fill-sign-pdfs.html](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/fill-sign-pdfs.html).

wjc4eh,"Observation about this sub So I've been on this sub every day for years. While there's always been a mix of types, there used to be a whole bunch of my brothers and sisters who have been at this for a long long time like me. Just in the past couple of years, it seems many if not all of them have disappeared - or at least have stopped posting and commenting. I stopped in March of last year. I am tempted to create a  long-term homeless sub because 99% of stuff on here  is now like - What's it like to be homeless, I'm about to be homeless, it is my first night/week/month of being homeless. Nothing wrong with that but when you've been out there for over a decade, it is nice to know there are others who know what that does to someone.

I can tell you that the longer you are homeless, it is like going further and furhter out into space - away from everyone else. It changes the way you look at everything, everyone, and every aspect of society. My biggest piece of advice to newly homeless is to trust nobody. At first, it was hard being alone all of the time. It is amazing what you can get used to. And one thing I've gotten used to is that things always only get worse. The older you get, the more difficult everything is and the more cynical and miserable you will become.

On my local sub, the majority of the discussion now is about how nobody can afford their rent increases and how having any place to live is becoming only for rich people. These same people are the ones who spent the last decade complaining about panhandlers and homeless camps. Funny how life events can change your perspective.

I left the library today, I don't know what happened today but I saw some cops standing there and I don't wanna be in trouble. I walked for an hour and found a McDonald's. 

I've ordered a small fries and a small cup of drink and I'm writing my diary here. But I'm gonna leave here in a while cuz this place doesn't look safe to me. There are some men on the parking lot and there were loud music playing. They've been staring at me when I went in. There's a shelter near by but they don't have wifi, guess I'm gonna sleep there for tonight.

I took a nap this noon while in the library. I dreamed about my family, I was still a kid and we were eating dinner together and my dad asked me how I was in school. I told him there's nothing to worry about.

When I woke up, there were tears in my face. I don't know was it because I just woke up, or because of the sadness. I miss having a family and being taken care of. I miss when there's people who think of me. But that is not gonna happen again. I will be alone for a very, very long time, and it's gonna be hard. My only wish is to stay sane while I'm alone. 

God, please help me get through this. I might not be a good believer but right now, you are all I got.

Nothing else happened today. Still very hot, hope tomorrow will be better bc tomorrow is raining.

This also means my plan of laundry and shower is cancelled. I'll do them tomorrow.

The library was dead silent. I was sitting on the floor of a corner all day and I couldn't even sleep. Depression started to attack me and I began to picture myself in a prison, only by my own will. There was no food, but I had plenty of water. 

I started to think about what I'm gonna do with my life. It looks like I've hit the rock bottom, and there seems to have no exit. I'm stuck here in life like I'm stuck here in the library: I won't die, but I'm also not living. What do I want with my life? I don't know. If surviving is my entire purpose, dying seems like more of a easy way out. 

Nah, who am I kidding? I'm not gonna kill myself, I still have no balls to do it. Maybe it means I haven't truly hit the real rock bottom yet? I don't know. Only thing I know I must not keep thinking about it, because if I thinking I might actually do it.

Today my friend's landlord found me sleeping in his couch. He said I'm trespassing and tell me to move out before night or he will call the cops. I don't wanna trouble my friend so I moved out at noon. I'm back on the street now. 

It's really, really hot today, almost 100 degree. Me and the buyer of my laptop agreed to meet at the Starbucks, which is almost 3 miles away and there is no bus that go there. I walked the whole way. During the journey I thought a million times of how I should just kill myself and end the suffering. Everytime I saw a truck passed by, I had an urge to jump in front of it. 

But I didn't. I couldn't do it. I said to myself ""what if something happens to the truck driver? He could be having a happy life with his family. Is it fair to hurt some else just to kill yourself?"" Then I laughed. Because all that was just excuse.

The truth is I'm just a coward. I didn't do it because I couldn't do it. I don't have the balls to do it.

It's a strange world, it's too hard to live, but it's also too hard to die. There are people choosing each side every day, but I'm kinda stuck in the middle. Then I suddenly realized that for homeless people, being homeless  isn't the most scary thing. What's the most scary is to lose hope. Homelessness is like drowning, it takes away your hope bit by bit, until you totally give up.

I went to the food bank first to get some food, got a tuna sandwich, PB&J, some snacks, a piece of left over cake, and a bottle of water. I'm pretty satisfied with all these. Then I started my journey to the public library, the bus stop was a mile away. When I was waiting for the bus I suddenly realized I forgot the charger for my phone and laptop! Then I had to head back and begged the landlord to open the door for me. All that unnecessary journey plus the hot muggy weather of Baltimore almost drove me crazy. 

Good thing is library is really cold and quiet, I used my phone and scheduled a study room and had a nice nap. After waking up I started searching everything I need from online, including shelter, temp work, food, etc. Then I listed my laptop on OfferUp and craiglist, hope the buyer will appear soon.

I developed severe PTSD. I already had PTSD due to domestic violence and being raped, but it has gotten worse since the fire. I was the last one left in the house and I almost did not make it out. The fire got so bad that I could not leave out the front door. I had to leave out of my bedroom window, which was on the second floor. I had to sit on the awning, next to huge continuous black smoke coming out from my window, while I waited for a ladder to help me down. I was terrified.

After the fire I had no where to go and no money, no friends or no family, so I had to stay on the street. I was too scared to go to a shelter. I lived under a bridge for four months. At first it was not too bad, but as time went on it got worse. It got hotter which was awful for me. I am super sensitive to the heat to the point where I actively avoid it. I actually have vitamin d deficiency because of it. I would rather have been homeless in the winter. You can bundle up as much as you want, but you can not do much when you are hot. Plus you want to stay covered because of mosquitoes and other bugs. Other than the heat, my spot would smell a lot after it rained and it would linger for days. The worst part of being homeless was the depression, which I am sure many of you would agree.

*I am also not asking for anything*

Today I panhandled in a super high class area with a chill vibe in hopes I would make enough scroungings to feed me and my cat for awhile (bad idea financially I know), and I've made $10 in like 5 hours here. In 5 hours in a shitty neighborhood I can make more than $50. *Why are the people who have the money so stingy with it.* If I had the means to get a job, I'd have one. If I didn't need help, I wouldn't be standing with cardboard in direct sunlight with a cat that would rather be anywhere else in the city. If I was gonna spend it all on fucking drugs or beer I wouldn't have weight on me, teeth only stained yellow from nicotine, and clear complexion on my face. If I was really just using my cat for sympathy, she wouldn't sit on my shoulders in loud ass stressful traffic. The only way to get people in a brand new Mercedes-Benz to actually care is if I'm ABSOLUTELY suffering, and it's reluctant at best. I get it's their money, but why does a poor person who shouldn't be giving me $40 have more compassion than someone who has so much money $40 is like pennies. Why is a homeless person more likely to throw me a couple dollars than grandpa in his new BMW. This is fucked up and shows where we are as a society. If you aren't a worker bee you deserve to die in their eyes. Ignoring me doesn't help the problem. My cat is still hungry. I'm still hungry. I'm still broke. I still can't get a job. I still can't afford anything. I still have to stand here.

It's not like I don't try, I have seasonal income that's legitimate, but seasonal isn't enough for a whole year. It's hard to get a traditional job when you live outside and have legitimate mental problems that inhibits alot of my abilities. People lack compassion the more money they gather because you can't get rich without fucking people over first. I'm thankful for those that give, I'm always greatful to live another day and $10 is enough to survive base level, but fuck me is it frustrating to be surrounded by millionaires that can't be bothered to give out a single dollar.",theycallmemaskface,150,9,3,1530

vuu29s,"No, the homelessness problem is not “really just a mental illness/drug addiction issue” I’m tired of hearing this shit. Let’s do some simple math to disprove this horseshit argument.

Minimum wage in my state (CA) is $15/hr. Housing on the lower end is like $1000/month (and that’s with a bunch of roommates). If you worked full time, you would be bringing in a whopping $2400 a month. This doesn’t meet the 3x rent criteria so you are already going to be struggling here.

So, to sum up, is it possible to technically survive on minimum wage working full time? Maybe, if you are really tight with money and have a lot of roommates. It isn’t going to be easy though. You are going to need two jobs realistically, but not everyone wants to do that nor should they have to imo. At that point being homeless seems like an easier option than spending your entire life at work just to have a roof over your head. So your options are: be a slave to your employer and spend every waking minute at work and have no free time, or be homeless.

And all this is assuming they can even get a job in the first place. It’s not easy to get a job in this economy and a lot of places don’t hire people with a criminal record.

I'm in central Oklahoma. There is someone staying in a tent by the river. They have been for a couple years now actually. Today, while working near the river bridge, I smelled *that smell.* Had to stop working, I was going to throw up. I know what I smelled. 

Me and a coworker drove the few hundred feet down the road and went down to the tent- a short walk through a trail that had been well defined, but was now starting to grow up with short bushes. Boots were at the entrance of the tent, standing next to each other. An empty pan was sitting next to the ashes of a campfire, clothes were hanging on the line, mildew covered due to the last week of rain. An animal had torn the tent open and food wrappers were strewn about. Everything looked like someone had just left it suddenly, and had been gone about a week.

I couldn't smell the smell by the tent though- it seemed to be coming more from downriver. The grass and weeds were too thick to go down there, and we had to get back to work. The police weren't interested in coming out because they said it was most likely a deer. 

It's absolutely possible that the person got help from someone, was arrested, or decided to just dip out.... But this doesn't sit right with me. I know something is wrong. I know what I smelled. I'm unable to get around by the river and don't know what to do.

If anyone is able or willing to search, knows how to help, or might know the person, I can PM location details, and the name that I saw painted on the side of the tent- I don't want to blast this person all over though. I just want to be sure they're okay... and if they aren't, they deserve a proper resting place.

UPDATE: I finally got contact with the right person and two police officers came out, and had me go out there with them. It rained all day today, after making this post. As soon as I pulled up I was *slammed* with the stench of death. The officers didn't smell it, but poked around for about 15 minutes before calling it off. They didn't bring dogs.

v40kiz,"Uplifting post for homeless teens So I just been reflecting on my youth. To all you homeless teens out there I will tell you this don't give up. I was raised by two drug addict parents who cared more about getting their next fix then taking care of their child. I was homeless from age 13 to 16 I dug in trash can lived under under passes I did what I had to do to survive. I got odd jobs cleaning pools and Landscaping to get money. I moved in and lived in the garage till I turned 18. I know it's hard going to school especially if you can't bathe and your clothes are not nice. I know it's hard getting made fun of and picked on. Been there done that. I'm telling you this in hopes that you might see it just to give you that little inspiration to fight on continue trying and pursuing your education in your dreams.

As hard as it was I continue through school even though it was constantly picked on I even went to college while high school using the money I I got from collecting cans doing odd jobs. Granted tuition was only $13 a credit hour back then. When I turned eighteen I decide to join the military. It was a hard process not having my social security card birth certificate all those things that were needed but they help me out during my time in the military continue to go to school and got my college degree. After leaving the military I started my life and went to medical school I became a doctor back in 2007. So why am I telling you all this so that you know that your destiny is not yet written. Yes there's a hell of an uphill battle and it's hard as hell never give up. Keep fighting keep trying no matter what you want to do in life go for it. Don't let anybody put you down just because of the circumstances surrounding your life. Most of you don't realize that the struggles that you endeavor it made you a formidable opponent strong person that can persevere in the most hellish circumstances you're a force to be reckoned with. Your life experience what you experience and what you've seen it made you stronger than you could ever imagine probably don't even realize your own potential",Think_Ad2385,83,1,6,521
v1mmac,"My mom is newly homeless My 65 year old mom live across the country from me and was evicted from her long term apartment about a month ago… the apartment she was living in was owned by my grandparents and when they died her siblings fought to get even with her financially. My mom fought tooth and nail with them for years to stay in this apartment as it was part of a lengthy property agreement and part of the family estate. Since my grandparents have died my mom has been disowned from her immediate family and was recently officially evicted from the apartment.

She is a hoarder and stayed until the last possible moment, waiting for the police to forcibly remove her. She is very manipulative and controlling even manipulating the police initially to letting her stay longer under the premise that she “might have covid” when they showed up a week or so earlier to remove her. She also has severe mental disabilities which have gone undiagnosed as well as health issues which according to her keep her from working the last 15+ years. I’ve always believed she could work as she is perfectly fine volunteering in gardening centers and going on boat outings with her friends. I have tried applying to jobs for her and putting tighter resumes, and it has always ended up being a waste of my time. At the end of the day she will use her health as an excuse for the fact that she does not want to work and I can’t force an adult to follow through being financially independent and responsible.


I just graduated college and am getting married in 3 weeks… my time and energy is very limited and I have anguish at night thinking about her and her situation. I don’t know how to help her and have limited resources. She has been couch surfing so far at a friends but she is no longer able to stay there. She also has a 60lb senior dog that is not helping her homelessness because a lot of the opportunities where she might have somewhere to stay would not accommodate her dog. This senior dog also wasn’t even hers initially and she adopted him a few years ago from an irresponsible family member who decided they just didn’t want him anymore. 

Honestly my mom should never been given this dog with her mental illnesses and hoarding. She constantly is screaming out loud and acting irrationally unable to control her emotions which makes her poor dog look nervous. On top of that he is a senior dog with mobility issues and he has been forced to live with her in a hoarder house where he is unable to walk normally in a regular living situation, nonetheless a hoarder one. He has been forced to live in an environment because of her where he has to squeeze between valleys  of hoarder mess that she creates and has limited space to even drink water or lay down. I’m trying to get her to give up the dog to someone with a stable living situation. 

My mom is extremely controlling and has psychotic episodes. My entire life she has tortured me and abused me not only physically but mentally and emotionally. Regardless at the end of the day I love and care for her deeply. But I definitely cannot live with her ever again. I moved out of the house right when I turned 18 and I never went back. We have a strained relationship and I can’t help but hold animosity towards her despite me loving her. Originally my fiancé and I were talking about buying a home with a mother in law suite that she could live in but I’m realizing more and more that would never work.

She was just visiting us and staying with us in our home and it was actual torture. Everyday she fought  and screamed with my fiancé over the smallest of things. Literally one night  she screamed and fought with him from 11pm until 6am. She also would pick him apart over every little thing he did on top of actively shit talking him anytime he left the room and trying to get me to call off the wedding. If it’s not her way with her control than she will argue you to death until you give in to her. She will also do wildly in appropriate things and have no regard for my fiancés and I’d feelings or wishes. Such as during this trip insisting on inappropriately  hanging out with our landlords and spreading all of her delusions and lies to them regarding my fiancé and I, and our relationship.

A huge part of this also has to do with her undiagnosed disabilities- my mom hallucinates and has a hard time deciphering reality from fantasy especially when it comes to memories or situations which she experienced… she has all sorts of wild obscure stories which definitely never occurred which she uses to castrate my fiancé despite him investing hours of time into her on his own and genuinely caring about her.  And when she is met with reason to the delusions and lies she tells she will gaslight, scapegoat, scream, get aggressive and blame anyone and everyone but herself. She is very difficult to interact with and she truly is toxic. Even when she isn’t having an aggressive outburst or hyper dividing on a delusion, her behavior generally is abnormal and bizarre. 

I love my mom and I’m genuinely scared for her. I know for a fact that I can’t have her  live with me without losing my mind as well as ruining my marriage. How can I help my mom and where can she go? She is not rational and is burning every bridge she has. She is open to moving to another state but is in Illinois currently. She also doesn’t think she hallucinates or has anything wrong with her, she instead just blames it on being “spiritual” and think she’s psychic.

Right away I noticed people treating me strange, which I’m used to because of my disability I don’t always come off as normal but this was different and it was freaking me out. It’s like they were being mean and polite at the same time. When the doctor finally came in he looked like he had been awake for a really long time and was sort of out of it. He walked in and just says what’s the problem with a mean face.  I tell him about my ear and he says let me get something to look at it, leaves the room for five seconds, comes back empty handed and grabs a scope off the wall he was just standing next to. Then he shoves it forcefully into my ear and I say that hurts really bad, he looks for a few more seconds, pulls the scope out, then jams it in again more aggressively and deeper and there is an excruciating pinch inside my ear so I yell out that really hurts, but he ignores me. When he pulls it out he just says I think it’s a canal infection so no pills just ear drops, and leaves. My ear is killing me when they finally bring the drops and discharge papers and I’m struggling to keep it together and when I got out of the room I just blurted how do I get out of here and power walked out the way they said. 

Today my ear is worse so I called the hospital to file a complaint. The administrator called me back and basically said the doctor did nothing wrong. I’m planning to go to an urgent care on Monday for someone else to look at it.

I don't mind my situation 99% of the time. I'm always upbeat and smiling, nice to anyone I cross paths with. If you met me, you'd think ""oh wow this guy is full of life and excited for each day!"". But it's the night that haunts me. 

My least favorite part of being homeless is being alone, especially at night. I sit here and miss my family who have pasted on, miss my friends I once spoke with. 

I seen a family today, mom/dad with two kids, playing together outside in their yard. Having an absolute blast. I burst into tears. And I'm no cry baby lol. But watching that family hit me hard. Will I ever have that? Forget a house, forget money. I want a family to call my own. I wanna be able to call my mom or dad after a long day. I want someone to make memories with, grow together. I haven't had that in so long. Years. 

I haven't had these thoughts in awhile but, I was in the hospital recently. During this time I realized, I really have no family now. They have all pasted. Nurse was asking the usual info and she asked that ""emergency contact"" question. If I died tonight, there would be no one to call and say ""I'm sorry but CarryOnRonnie has pasted"". 

I have these grand plans of getting down to South America and backpacking, since I literally backpack around cities why not do it in the jungle lmao. But is that really the plan for my life? Do I really want that or do I feel that's my only option? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like every decision I make is wrong.

Someone tell me this isn't a life sentence I used to tell myself I will not let this be the rest of my life when I was a 16 year old sleeping in the park crashing on my friend's couch. I thought it was so easy back then, all I had to do was survive to 18 and get a job, then I could get my own place. I've never been so wrong in my life. I turned 18 and couldn't get hired, I didn't know it until then but I had grown up in a town where work is notoriously scarce, and I came of age well after the housing market collapsed in the US so even back then wages weren't competing with rent. There was only one shelter and it was so infested with bed bugs that when my friend spent just one night there he came out covered in red welts. When I visited the place to ask for resources, I saw people laying in the dirt outside the building, it was hard to tell whether they were dead or just high. So I made the jump and got on a bus, left all my friends and what family I had left behind, threw myself into the unknown in hopes I could make a life for myself away from that place. 4 years I've been from shelter to shelter, drop in centers, psychiatric hospitals. I got on the right medication. My mental health improved, I started working. I got a section 8 voucher. Life in the shelter system was hell, but I kept thinking of that voucher and the vision of the life I was still holding on to in my mind, a normal, stable life. When I held that voucher in my hands the first time I thought it was all over, like I was finally out. Nine months have passed and I'm back on the street, barely holding on to my job, went to a drop in center yesterday and now waiting for placement in another shelter. Out of curiosity I googled the place this center called for me, and once I saw the pictures of multiple beds in one cubicle something in me snapped. I have avoided drugs for so many years but I would do anything to numb this pain right now. I wish that I could stop seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling, I want to scream. I want to take this voucher and rip it into pieces and then set it on fire. I'm so angry, what is the point of striving to work and make money and learn new things and have human connections with others when the summary of my entire life is confined to a cube smaller than a jail cell that I will likely be sharing with somebody addicted to meth?

The US has a dysfunctional healthcare system.

The US is misusing its land for beautification and keeping food prices high.

Why a homeless person does not move to some small cities where rents are much much cheaper. I have seen 200-300$ apartments.

Why when some people have the time, why don't they take dart cheap health care in some other countries? That would balance the high demand for health care.

The US has a dysfunctional real state system.  I mean some leaving place should be available that can be rent in a few 2-3$per days with only access to an only basic necessity (common bathroom and shower).

The US has a dysfunctional business CSR. Why these large businesses are not doing some sort of service.

Last week one of the people I know risked his life to come to the US, and now he is in jail.

In my country, The people who live in the slums (5-10$/month) (food (60-80$/month).  (shitty but available govt-funded free health care) spends a good time compared to homeless people in the US.

uk9bhf,"Are You Homeless and Being Gangstalked I've been studying the phenomenon of gangstalking for awhile now and am also a victim myself. Many people who call themselves Targeted Indviduals claim that one of the main goals of gangstalking is to drive a person to homelessness. They have pushed me to the brink a couple times by hacking job applications and keeping me from gaining employment, I finally had to resort to places that had paper applications.

During this time I went to a city to speak to a senator's aide about some issues related to my situation. I stayed at a mission and found several who say they are being gangstalked. Strange things happened, people I had never met knew things about my situation. I was actually assaulted while there by a knife wielding woman yelling out things that were relevant to my situation. 

The gangstalkers work to make the target appear crazy. If they have a drug or mental health issue they exploit it, that way when they have them in the system they can just claim they were crazy or on drugs.

I'm just wondering how many of you have encountered people who claim they are being gangstalked or are victims yourself. I'm trying to compile commonalities to get this phenomenon recognized as reality. The fact that so many say the gangstalker's goal is to drive them to homelessness and suicide is a strong indicator that this is reality. How could so many people have the same shared delusion. Not all are homeless they do their best to work and keep a roof over their head, but obstacles one endures can often make death seem like a better option.",HatAccomplished2143,33,3,3,1530

I woke up to the sound of this tow truck hooking me up. I was sleeping in the driver seat with the keys in the ignition. I started the car but as soon as I was put it into reverse the tow truck driver had lifted the front of the car. The driver demanded $100 to ""drop the car"". It had to either be paid in cash or ""cash app"". He said several people had already paid him in the parking lot a few minutes earlier. I downloaded the app, made an account and added my debit card to pay him. Well I did this the driver kept spitting on the ground and puffing on his vape. I told the tow truck driver all he would have had to do was honk his horn or knock on my window and I would leave. He responded arrogantly ""then I wouldn't make any money"". After he let me down, he quickly drove over to a van that was beside me. I honked my horn several times at the van. Hoping to wake them up in time. This obviously annoyed the tow truck driver. The tow truck driver had started on one side of the parking lot and was working his way across the parking lot getting his $100 from everyone. While the tow truck was busy with the van, I knocked on the windows of 6 other cars and vans and waking them up and telling them what was happening. While I was waking up the fifth car, a second tow truck arrived on scene. After knocking on the sixth car window, the two tow trucks try to block me off. I escaped and then drove around the parking lot making sure everyone was awake. The two remaining cars I wasn't able worn had there dome lights on and we're awake from all the racket. I hope they were able to find their keys, start their cars and get out of there in time. After that I check the second parking lot on the side of Walmart. I didn't see any car campers or RVers there.

I used to not mind so much until this year, when a formerly recently homeless new tenant apparently told his buddies they could crash in the treed area bordering the little parking lot. In addition, I've found 5 shopping carts full of stinky shit left there during the daytime when they go off on their coordinated begging missions. I called the stores they belonged to, and the cops, but no one was interested in retrieving them, so into the nearest dumpster they went, along with all of the stinky crap, some of which contained uncapped needles. That's where it will go again.

I used to not mind. I've been homeless myself, and now work a job I hate because I'm older, for one, and just can't tolerate the contempt for the homeless that I, somewhat ironically, now possess myself! It didn't have to be that way.

I have an idea for how we can help end homelessness but it’s definitely a stretch and I want to know your guys opinions on it, but before I tell you let me first say this is still in the ideas phase and isn’t fully fleshed out and I do understand there’s a lot of flaws and things that would have to be put into this, please lend some constructive criticism and comments on what you think would make this a better idea in the comments and I look forward to some civilized discussion.

So my idea is that a community of people donates their money and time to open a homeless support center, this is going to provide a place to sleep, a bathroom to freshen up, some new clothes if needed and serves 3 meals a day. This centers purpose is to give people a temporary home while also helping them get back on their feet, they can stay as long as they need and there will be events happening all the time providing them a quick job to get some work experience, they also can use our computers to make a resume and they can use the buildings address on their resume, they also can use our phone numbers too and there will be a whole team that takes phone calls and notifies them when a job offer comes in or an interview!

While they are living here they will continue to work freelance gigs we provide as well as search for a full time job, with our address they can make a bank account for savings and once they’ve saved enough they can move out to live on their own given they’re able to provide for themselves. And when someone needs to move out we will have more jobs posted for others to help them move in as well as buy the furniture and utilities they need, this not only allows the others to get more work experience but it also helps bring people together in the community.

(This next part would most likely be later on when there’s more funding and people to help) there also will be an educational center where anyone can get an education and get their degree if needed, this is helpful for younger homeless people and those who struggled to graduate, and if they need more time to get the degree we will provide them more time. 

Like I said this is all just in the ideas phase but let me know what you think, would this be helpful? And would this help end homelessness?",RoyalMWP123,1,1,11,964

I am currently doing a project that focuses on the homeless and unhoused populations and need a few first person perspectives. This is a speculative project focusing on the creation of a brand of low cost and sustainable hygiene necessities that would be easily accessible to many low income and homeless communities. Here are a few of the questions: 

Were you ever in a situation where you didn’t have access to basic necessities; including oral hygiene products, deodorant, shampoo, body wash, or menstrual care items?

Did you ever not know the next time you would be able to brush your teeth or take a shower?

Did you ever frequent homeless shelters or churches, hoping they might be able to provide those hygiene necessities? 


If you feel comfortable, I would appreciate you answering these questions in any way you see fit. Be that in the comments or DM. Thank you!",MudRecent7748,3,6,6,521

I had to go through a relatively affluent area, not really a neighborhood, just a couple of blocks where the residents are generally upper middle or even upper class.

I was just trying to get to the centre to eat and shower, but a well dressed couple came around the corner as I was nearing the end of the block, and they looked at me and fucking pointed at me. Then they LAUGHED.

I'm not talking about the quick awkward laugh that people make when they are nervous. I'm talking about a full, mean spirited, condescending laugh that absolutely knocked the wind out of my soul.

The woman nudged her head at me as they passed me and they were whispering to each other.

Why are people like this? Why do I have to endure this torture when I'm just trying to make my way to a place where I can clean up and eat? 

I sure hope those two never have to face this kind of classist bullying. It may shatter their brittle grasp on reality.

tbhekq,"How do you guys deal with the scorn of society? I've been homeless for nearly a year now. 

I am trying to change that. I work where I can, save money where I can, and definitely try and do my part in society.

But what really hurts me the most isn't the cold or the humiliation, it's the fact that people are willing to go out of their way to make my life miserable.

Minding my own business in the library? Dirty looks, finger pointing, maybe even a few bold selfies that weren't even hidden that well.

Going to work looking like crap because despite not sleeping or eating well for weeks, I still want to turn my life around? Stares from people, comments that I'm a junkie, more dirty looks.

I find it so hard to stay optimistic when I go out there every single day and get beaten down by the misplaced opinions and judgements of people who are fortunate enough to have a place to sleep in, and three meals a day.

It's not only me. I see plenty of other homeless get this treatment as well. It's absolutely soul sucking. I'm lucky enough not to have been beaten up just for being homeless, like some people I know who don't have a violent bone in their body. They just look a bit ungroomed.

I shower every couple days, shave my beard, and try and replace my clothes when possible, but I can't hide the bags under my eyes, nor the uncomfortable feeling of feeling out of place. My items may not stink, but they are old and look worn out.

I hate that I try and do everything right, don't touch booze or drugs, work even when my legs are about to give out, and still get looked at like I'm some sort of parasite.

It's making me suicidal. Not that anyone would care if I bit the dust. Bleak but true.

sr330o,"Honestly reddit I know I'm overreacting but I just want to go home My friend just tagged me in a post on Facebook and there's the home that I grew up in being auctioned off. I'm overwhelmed with so many emotions. It was the only home I ever knew I've been there since I was a baby I had my own room. I played within those walls for hours. I learned how to cook in the kitchen. I used to venture around the yard and have fun. There was even a nice park in the neighborhood.

Many of my dogs and cats are buried in that yard. Even my guinea pig mocha. I live there with my grandma until she died. The moment she died many of my family members ushered me and my siblings out so they can get the house cleaned up and sell it all they cared about was money they didn't even care if we had anywhere to go.

I remember the day she died everyone came home with us and argued about who got what furniture. I'm autistic, 26 years old... Grandma died when I was 21. I don't qualify for disability because I'm too smart. And I've worked many jobs and even got my own GED. I just got out of academy for grooming dogs. 

About 5 years later I'm still homeless since being kicked out. I just don't make enough to rent. At least not yet I'm still trying to get through my 200 haircuts to make commission pay. Even then I doubt I'd be able to afford anywhere as nice as my old home was. My heart aches knowing that I'll never be able to go in my old room again. I think me being autistic just makes it harder for me to adapt to the fact that I'll never have that home again.

Id honestly do anything to have that home again but there's nothing that can be done and it just breaks my heart.  Right now I live in a broken down RV in the roof leaks when it rains and the insulation is horrible. None of my appliances work. It is literally falling apart around me.

s9m3hu,"My car that I sleep in was stolen today It's an older model car but it *was* mine. The car isn't insured anymore so it can't be replaced. I only know my phone, ipad, and computer were in the car along with most of my other needs and things. The area I was parked in has a lot of transient activity I wasn't aware before leaving my car idling. I only left the car on bc I was gonna be in and out of the store but someone beat me back to it.

The cop that arrived wasn't very helpful and seemed like he had better things to do. I was having a severe panic attack and the paramedics that arrived with the cop were very kind helping me.

The business I was inside of camera only recorded detected motion of me pulling into their parking lot but not the person driving away in my car.. Something about motion only picking up large groups of ppl or big moving objects like cars. The only activity on camera following my car theft was when the cops arrived. There were no other cameras around that could pick up anything except for a warehouse but I was told ppl aren't always working in the warehouse so no one answered when I knocked. Definitely going back.

It started snowing immediately after this happened so I couldn't walk around to try and find it. I was told by a few of the business employees and customers that sometimes ppls cars are found but not in the same condition :(

Apple can't find my phone bc I have a 2 step verification so I have to wait for them to verify my acct which could take days? This is so insane to me! I'm truly baffled by all of the technology and cameras in our world for things like this but none of it helped me today. If Apple could track the phone or ipad, maybe the car could be located too... if they didn't throw the phone out of the window.

Right now, I have no phone, no car, no clothes or other necessities... I have only my purse and IDs and what I went to the store for on me now...  but I was able to get a room nearby for the night. I feel like an idiot and I'm embarrassed and just lost.

s1zgw4,"My GF and I are homeless by choice. With a Ford Escape. And honestly it's been great I lived in the same apartment for 5 years now. When my ex left me in the first 2 years I was living there, I needed help paying the rent. So I let someone rent the big bedroom and I stayed in the 2nd tiny room. Everything was great as far as being single. Go to work, play video games. Go back to work. New roommate was milking disability benefits for a leg injury that had been fixed a long time ago. I think if you can walk a mile to the grocery store you are no longer a person with a leg disability. He stayed home 24/7. Never had the apartment to myself for 2 years straight. He didn't take showers and reeked up the whole apartment. But hey, he payed his rent and that's all I cared about. I could tolerate it. I met my deaf girlfriend. She moved in after awhile and I still accepted the small bedroom. Everything was cool for a year. Then my roomate became a wannabe streamer for a cell phone game. I think RAID Shadow Legends or some shit like that. I could hear him streaming and talking to whatever viewers he had. I thought cool at least he's doing something. He never made any income yet on his streaming, so I assumed it was lame and had like 3 viewers. After a year of living with my GF we started having problems. My girlfriend has 3 kids not in her custody and they came to visit sometimes and spend the night. Usually every other weekend. Roomate couldn't handle the noise of kids having fun in the living room. He refused to close his door because my cats were his only friends. On top of that my GF liked to stay busy and clean the house. And being a deaf person you can't hear how loud you may be. But she enjoyed cleaning and couldn't go back to work until her hand got better. She had lots of pain in her right hand. All of a sudden my roommate starts complaining about noise and how it interrupted his streaming and his life. He said living with my GF was like hell. My GF never interacted with him. Then he started coming out of his room when my GF was cleaning the apartment to stare at her and make her uncomfortable so she will stop cleaning. She no longer wanted to stay in the house during the day. So I said ok, we will work on moving out and she will go to her mom's house during the day while I work. Then I told my roommate don't worry you will have the apartment to yourself now everyday. We will only be there at night to shower and sleep. He said things like ""good, it's like hell living with her, she does meth and tweaks and cleans all day"". My GF does not do drugs or even drink so I laughed. He said she wants to take advantage of me and have a baby with me. And I laughed again because my GFs tubes are tied and doesn't want anymore kids. And he just kept talking shit in general and demanded that it's quiet and I tell him whenever someone is coming over. At this point I was like WTF. This man is incredibly toxic as fuck and I've been nothing but nice to him. So my GF and I said fuck this. We packed some shit and ate sleeping in our Ford Escape at her friends place who live in an RV on their own property. It's nice out here. You can see the stars and it's out in nature. I still go to work and do doordash. Except now I can save all my hard earned money for our own place. It's like this stress has been lifted off my chest. No more rent, no more electric bill, no more internet bill. No more gas bill. I shut all that shit off and left my roomate to fend for himself. He will not be able to afford that place by himself. And I was willing to give him advance notice about moving out. But after all the shit he talked, what do you expect. I type this on my phone as I enjoy a beer outside our SUV before I get ready to go to sleep. Can use our friends shower in their RV. Their BBQ. Everything is good.

rpd37r,"Why does land exclusion exist? Property does not shrink because someone uses it. The reason it's not free is because of hoarding, & the notion that might equals right. There's zero basis for excluding anyone from owning property, except greed, or *to make the economy work*, which is to say that our economy depends on false scarcity.

And for everything the land produces, like trees, it's not *supply and demand* that ultimately decides what's available, it's *the earth*. Supply & demand might motivate a land owner to permit a logging company to come through and chop down trees, & it might motivate someone to plant new trees, but it's the land and the eco-system that *make the trees*. 

How did they get that land that they getta decide who can or cannot take trees from it? Well, it began with land theft.

There's zero justification for a limitted number of people owning the majority of the natural resources. I defy anyone to justify it.

Our economic system as it is would not exist if it wasn't for land theft.

I just want a small patch of land, to pitch a tent, or build a shitty little cabin, but I can't because it'd be a threat to the imposed scarcity that our economy... or *the rich, rather*, rely on. That scarcity is the real model is evidenced when a homeless person can't even have a tent on unused land for very long. They're always chasing us off. Why? Is it really freeloading to take residence on the earth?

 I'll gladly work for food & whatever else I need.  It's the scarcity of land that I don't understand. There's no justification for it. 

What would be the cost of living if it wasn't for fat cats extracting wealth from us for having the right to land?

EDIT: I'm not arguing for or against any economic system. I'm not educated enough for all that. I just wanna know how you justify land exclusion.

EDIT 2: To anyone that promotes destruction, this is my response. *I* believe in democracy, grassroots movements, power in numbers. If we gain these things, destruction isn't necessary. *You* believe, apparently, in *the right people/person* taking power. That's dictatorship.",siliconscrolls,3,1,9,1231

He's complained about a string of 30 day bans so if anything at all is monitored he won't be able to continue propagating this inhumane filth.

rhz6j8,"Who else feels lied to? Antiwork+Anticapitalsm Capitalism is embedded into us beginning in childhood. But, sometimes, this trick doesn't work on all of us :D

As long as capitalism exists, we'll always have homelessness, hunger and poverty in this world. It's been said that capitalism creates jobs but it's never called out for producing homelessness, hunger, poverty, and even death. As for creating jobs, who would need a job if natural resources such as shelter and food were free?... as they should be.

We're told to work hard... go to college.... build an empire... but what we're not told is that if we don't do these things, we will likely fail miserably in our capitalist economy. Being told to work hard & go to college... isn't for our own good btw. It's the only way to keep capitalism which is our economy... afloat.

Why is nothing we're taught able to fix this broken world? With all of the college education, political parties, awareness, and resources-we can't figure out how to get along or end poverty. Or, how to overthrow the system that has us all trapped in economic bondage! Sadly, I think we're at a time in human existence where natural selection means every man for themselves! Adaptation and survival of the fittest isn't about biological factors anymore.... It has a whole new meaning... Money is the only survival tool needed for the future...bc health can only be bought now... those not financially prepared will remain in bondage or die off...

Would ending homelessness, hunger and poverty also end capitalism or just a huge chunk of it?

Edit: We think we're self sufficient but we're not. Working for others under a monetary system and having to hand all of your earnings into the hands of others for them to give you things you need when you can do those things yourself, is not self sufficiency. Seriously, is anyone out there fed up with the fact that everything we're taught all leads to this> you will work and buy until you die. We're crippled with illusions. All many of us do is work to make our employer richer and we buy things-rent, food, car, hobbies, entertainment, and bills. Everything around you is literally attached to money. How is just about every public building, including the one you call home, designed to extract money from you? Is anyone else out there disturbed that we're as lost as animals... being extorted out of all of our earnings and exploited into thinking we have to do back breaking work to have access to these things...

Christmas parties & bonuses are cool, but let's be clear, we should know by now we're all just the middle men that our employers use to take money from us and each other. Commercials and ads and every building you see outside of your home is designed to take money from you by providing a product or service that you didn't know you needed :D The law (and banks) backs up some of these products and services saying it's illegal to not have them... Laws are free promotion and advertising for certain businesses.

Capitalism doesn't bring anyone out of poverty bc poverty only exists in a capitalist world. Placing a price on natural resources such as wood and food and animals, and constantly telling others if they work for someone else by getting a job, they can have the things that they need... is just wrong and extreme psychosis. Capitalism constructs such as rent and mortgage are the reason ppl are homeless. Capitalism constructs such as insurance requirements, prevents many ppl from being able to seek medical help, especially preventative care. With all things considered, capitalism and greedy world is responsible for poverty, crime, and death.

It's strange you can work a job 40 hrs a week and still not earn enough to have a roof over your head... I, like many others on this sub, am not homeless by the choices I made... I went to college and swore off kids so I wouldn't be like my family members but guess what, I still work, I'm underpaid and can't afford a studio or 1 bdrm apt in my city so I live out of my car. The system is rigged and only those who are fortunate to own a businesses, or work in their field, or work in an in demand area are the ones who can live comfortably, but for the other half of ppl who still work 40+ hrs a week, they will go without what they need. And this is a system that has to be broken.. Everyone should be able to have housing regardless of employment status or income. That's the only way to fix the homeless problem is to make housing free for all bc clearly and sadly, having a job doesn't mean you'll have a home. I don't understand why this has to be workshopped, bc I am for free food and housing as a way to end poverty such as hunger and homelessness. ",BYE2LIFE,84,2,3,1530

r9fii6,"Looking for some advice. Hi everyone,
 I just want to start by saying I'm not looking for a handout or anything like that, hopefully just some plain old advice. Im in the UK if that makes any difference to any advice that can be given.
 I used to live with my wife, our 2 cats and our little dog. 7 months ago we had some new neighbours move in underneath our flat. This was the beginning of hell for us. From day one we had problems. I'm not talking about noise, there was all the usual things like that but it was harrassment all day, even if we were in, they would spend all day banging the ceiling, calling my wife the worst names, that escalated to death threats which resulted in them smashing our bedroom window with a brick, trying to kick our front door in and throwing bottles at us. I'm Irish myself and there was a lot of Irish racism too. 
 The police were called, they did nothing. We had the girl on CCTV smashing the winwo, not enough evidence apparently, I sent the council and police CCTV of so many things happening. The council ""lost"" the footage and the police simply didn't care. This was happening EVERY day until my partner couldn't take it anymore and I found her after coming home from helping my dad move some things out of his place. She nearly died, it was very close. The hospital then discharged her to my parents shed. This is just an unheated storage room contains 20 years of belongings. We have been living there since September. I can't seem to find any help or way out. no one seems bothered at all from my MP to the mental health services, council, police etc. We are just stuck here. 
 My partner has serious mental health issues that have been made worse because of this. I have told our situation to anyone I can think of but I'm just getting nowhere. Obviously it's getting colder and hanging out in a shed at minus five degrees isn't fun at all.
 I am just my partner's carer, we aren't rich and can get accepted for private rental due to the credit checks, it's not that we have bad credit, we have no real credit. The council won't help at all. We are just stuck here with no where to go and no life at all.
 I have now been diagnosed with schizophrenia myself which has been brought ok because of this. I just don't know where to turn now. At one point the council was going to home us in a travelodge as you can bring your pets but they changed their mind on this (il assuming due to costs) and since then we have just been here. Not living, just existing.
 I'll stop here. If anyone would like more information I'd be happy to share. I'm just looking for some advice. To see if there's something I may have missed.
 I appreciate anyone has has read this far. I know there are people worse off than I am, I know there are people actually on the streets but this is unreal for me. I feel like I'm just losing my mind. It gets worse everyday and I have nowhere to reach out to.

qtoyyc,"WHY I JOINED THIS SUB AND WHY I AM HERE! I'm  NOT saying donating plasma once, twice or infrequently will hurt your  long term health. What I am saying is consistently donating plasma over  long periods of time will eventually degrade your overall health. I've  worked with homeless people for over 35 years. Back in the day homeless  friends I helped donated plasma often as they were allowed to generate  survival income. I still remember the places names. Hyland Plasma  Services and Community Plasma Services. I used to wait for my homeless friends at the Roy Rodgers having breakfast while they were processed. The process of donating literally took half their day.

Today 35 years later these guys seem to have more medical issues.  Maybe it wasn't the plasma donations. These guys used to be alcoholics,  drug addicts, they used to participate in candidate prescription drug  studies, they did it all. They made money but to look at them now their  health shot. I don't think it was worth it long term. The problem is  poor people must survive today. Planning long term even for things vital  as health are luxuries \\ privileges enjoyed by the better off.

I was born into a very sheltered life. I come here because, I have  serious blinders on.

He showed me street homelessness and did not  protect me for his lived reality back then. He showed me the rescue  mission. I was aghast at what I saw! This was in the 1980's.

Homelessness in 2021 has changed greatly since 1980 especially given  COVID19. I come here because I do not want my eyes to close and my heart  to harden against those who have no home. I come here because how can I  help if I don't know what is needed. As an autistic being I need  concrete understanding of homeless suffering to generate and maintain  empathy in the face of media and politicians who routinely blame the  homeless for their plight.

A few months back, an abandoned house two doors down from us burned down and the fire caught our next door neighbors’ roof, so they moved out. Around September, we noticed a dude sleeping on their porch.  

The only time I’ve ever seen him was when I freaked him out by accident once while leaving for work late.  I looked over and we made eye contact and he looked so startled.  I gave him a peace sign, and I imagine he knows we don’t care that he’s sleeping there by now? 

Anyway.  We have a shed in our backyard we don’t use, and I want to tell him he is welcome to sleep there if he wants and we can unlock it for him.  I don’t know how to approach him.  He’s got a nice set up, but I never actually see him.  I don’t want to freak him out.

The upside is that the facility and staff are wonderful. I have never met such a nice group of well-meaning and generous set of people in my life. The downside, without a doubt, is my fellow residents. These people are shockingly rude and ungrateful. You would think they would be humbled by their circumstances, but instead they endlessly complain and ask for more. The food is too cold. We don’t get enough premium cable channels. Cigarettes should be free. It never ends with these people. I am one of the few here who still owns a vehicle. They are utterly shocked that I am unwillingly to drive them all over town in exchange for Oreos and Potato Chips and the like. Oh and they love to steal at every opportunity that presents itself.

I pretty much only have my clothes from summer. I don't know what to do. I was doing great and about to get a job (well I had an interview) but since I'm having emergency dental procedure this week and won't be able to make it back in time to sleep for the night they are going to kick me out.

qht2tt,"I think I'm being taken advantage by a homeless person. Need some serious advice! I went to the store and this young lady asked for money. She said she aged out of the foster care system and was needing some money to get something to eat and for some personal hygiene items. I felt bad for her and gave her $60 out of my savings. Mind you, I only had $200 in my savings which took some time to save and had $30 separate for groceries to last for 2 weeks. Before I went to my car, I felt bad for her and I asked her could I pray for her. After we prayed she asked could she have my number. I was hesitant, but gave it anyway. Later that day she texted me and asked for $150 because some random lady offered her a room.  I wasn't sure how she would afford to keep paying for rent, but I remembered her saying she was looking for a job. I felt bad for her, and told her I would cashapp her $90 to add to the $60 I gave her earlier. She than texted back ""Okay great, idk how i'm going to find $150 next month for rent that's due on the ""11th,"" but God will work it out.""Next day she sent a cashapp request for $75 for groceries and than texted me after, that God had placed it on her heart to do so. I didn't respond that day, but the next day I felt bad for her and told her I could give her $20. This is what I felt comfortable giving her because I only had $50 left in my savings. She was still insisting that I give her $75 instead, and told me that she would no longer ask for money afterwards. I declined her request and told I could only give $20.  So I cashapp her $30 instead to cover the cashapp fees. She than texted me later that night and said she wanted to kill herself because the lady who offered her a room kicked her out because her child didn't feel comfortable with her staying in her house and she couldn't get her $150 back for the room. She said she called the cops but they sided with the house owner. I didn't know what to say so I didn't reply back. The next day she sent me a cashapp request for $80. I'm like okay, I feel bad for her, but she is starting to ask for money everyday now since I met her. I called her and told her I really can't help anymore, but she begged and said she was asking for $80 because she was trying to get her i.d to apply to jobs and was wanting to get a room. Knowing that her being able to get back on her feet, and get off the streets was more important than my needs. So I took $15 out of my groceries money and the last $20 out of my savings to cashapp her $35 for an i.d. I also offered to give her homeless shelter numbers and would call them if needed for her so she could have a place to stay. I felt kind of like an idiot because I only had $15 left for groceries to last me for 2 weeks and didn't have anymore money in my savings.**Her request for money didn't stop!** Today she texted me for $60 to get a room and sweared she would pay me back. I don't get it, I told her I don't have anymore money to help her with. I feel terrible for her, but she seems to completely ignore what I say to her......

qh3cg2,"He was homeless.... now he’s using me? I met him in February on tinder. He was homeless, and trying to find his way after moving to LA with absolutely nothing to start turn his life around. From the hood in the Midwest, went to jail for a couple months, Found god and has changed. No doubt about this. He’s from the same place my family is from so I completely understand it, I have family members with similar stories....he didn’t tell me all this for awhile though- and eventually.... it basically turned into him living with me unofficially. He has money a lot of the time but nothing sustainable. Eventually we kinda got romantic, and it seemed very genuine. Hes bought me 2 outfits as gifts, he helps around the house, always helps me clean, buys me snacks, etc. It was consistent, and he gave me all his attention for a long time. We’re kinda best friends.....with benefits. But at the same time- I still have to pay for basically everything for him. he eats all my food if it’s something he likes- even if I tell him not to. So I have to hide it. I’m gone 13hrs most weekdays and I once caught him bringing his other (displaced) friend over even when I’ve asked him not to. (PTSD) I believe he has a room he’s renting a couple cities away but he’s stayed with me almost everyday since the beginning.

I went thru his phone bc he was being weird & found out his friend told him “he’s too comfortable and he needs to find new hoes because I’m just going to leave him for someone” so I realize he’s seeing another girl secretly as of this week and now he doesn’t even kiss me or hold me. I’m realizing I’m very unhappy because of him (I can’t go anywhere/do anything unless it involves him which also means I’d have to pay for him) so obviously, I’m feeling kinda taken advantage of. It’s obvious that using tinder was kinda his way of not sleeping on the streets, but we have history (fuck the romance, but he is ambitious, spiritual and is much like me in ways I’ve never seen, he tells me things he wouldn’t tell anyone else ) and I don’t want to have to be that person. Honestly if I cut him off, I know for a fact no one is going to deal with his BS like I would. (Not kidding) We always talk about loyalty being important in life and he has shown his when it’s really mattered to me.

I was weak and let him back into my life because I was scared of being homeless alone, and didn't have any money and he ""fed"" me.

He gave me two black eyes, and bruising all over my face and skull. All while I was sick with bronchitis in a tent in the middle of the woods.

He kept telling me, I'm gonna be making $600 this week I'm gonna save it and get us a place. 

But I never saw the money. Then he brought hard drugs around me which made me sick and scared.

I woke up in the middle of the night after he had assaulted me, and he was asleep, I snuck off and called 911 because my eardrum had been ruptured and it was giving me a lot of pain. The cops, after multiple reports finally believed me, and they've filed charges against him.

But he's not in jail yet. But I am somewhere safe.

I know there's a chunk of homeless people who are dealing with abuse, or controlling partners, or, partners holding them back. 

Stand up for yourself, RUN, and survive. There's so much more in life in store for you. 

I still have bad days, but, they are getting better knowing I can't be hurt anymore.

It's damn near impossible to find shelters like this one, but ease don't give up looking.  I'm from Florida, shelter name removed for safety purposes, they allow you to stay for 8-12 weeks, you get your own bed room, with a password lock, the property address is confidential and not listed on Google, and you get a case manager to help you along the way to recovery.

I've subscribed to this form for a few reasons, one of which is reminding myself to have gratitude and knowing that in retrospect my problems are not always big problems. That being said, this sub has taught me to be more compassionate towards people who are homeless. 

I have two questions actually, 

1. The people who beg / panhandlers by the freeway and streets (near red lights) are those good people, should I give them money? (I'm in California) I've been giving money to homeless people who are quiet, and keep to themselves, not actively begging, because I'm not sure if it's a business or they really need the cash. What are your thoughts on panhandlers?

2. Also I saw this on video, I thought it was neat and wanted to copy the idea. I wanted to buy 100 burgers/tacos from a local fast food place, and spend the day with my gf just handing them out to homeless people. Is this a good idea, will it make someone's day or make a difference? I want to be able to give what I can to make someone's day.

I do know there is the occasional corporate donation, and those can be huge..10, or 20k goes a long way.

q52ndd,"I used to be homeless.. And honestly I'd rather be. I used to be homeless with my fiance, most of it without a job until we moved in with his mother, then to my mothers. I had moved out of my mothers home right after I had turned 18 due to many reasons. She lived in a city with not many stores in walking distance. I had no car and no job at the time, any job i got i had to quit due to having to work fast food and she didnt like how I had to come home late most nights and I couldnt work earlier due to her not coming home yet from work so she can take me. My depression and anxiety got worse, I feared I would never get out and be able to make something of myself. I felt useless. So I contacted my friend, he had known of the way she would treat me, she would brush aside how I felt and made me feel as if i'm not doing my best when there was no way i could. Me and my friend arranged a day i would leave. I planned to leave before she got home one day and on a day my brother was at his fathers house. It was my only hope to get out of the cycle. I was too late. She got home before he had gotten there. She saw my things packed and told him when he pulled up ""she has an IEP! She cant leave me till shes 21!"" I then got scared. Losing all hope of having a chance. She was yelling and leaning into the window of his car ""if you take her i WILL call the police and tell them about her IEP"" I looked at him with tears and fear in my eyes, he asked her politely to remove herself from the window and she did. He then drove off. I started to panic. He said theres no such thing of having to stay with a parent till 21 if you have an IEP. I looked it up and it was true.. I didnt want to leave her that way. But the degration i wouldve gone through if i told her.. I didnt want to deal with. After a bit i had a job and was working a new one when his mother said ""if you lose this job soon you will have to leave."" I got a bit anxious but was confident i wouldnt lose the job. I loved this job and didnt see a panic attack happening at work like the last one did to make me lose it.. Sadly.. A panic attack did take my job away.. We were at a community college. I was fine until the point that i was left alone for a bit. I was confused as to way i was feeling so anxious, then looking at the people around me made it worse. I went to the bathroom in hopes of it going away. It didnt. I dont have panic attacks too often. But for some reason i did. And i didnt know it was panic attacks at the time so i was scared. I had scratched my hand trying to get myself to calm down so badly it made my hand raw. After it went down i felt dizzy. But my friends helped me bandage it up and took me to work. I was told i couldnt come back till it healed and to call when it did. I agreed since it was food i worked with and said id call on sunday. My wound got better, but when i called, i was told i was let off, after being told by my friend he thinks i did it for attention. I had to move out since i lost my job and after a while a friend let me stay with them. This was when the virus was first starting. For a few months i was there.. Until i met my fiance. After meeting up a few times i felt the need to go with him. So i did. We stayed in an abandoned house together until we moved in with his mother. I was so happy. His mother then started showing her true colors as well as his step father. I was woken one night by my face being poked real hard multiple times. I rarely cuss towards someone.. But this time i did. I said ""can you fu**ing stop?"" My fiance heard and long story short.. A fight happened. This led us to getting a tent and being homeless. Honestly... Thats the happiest i had ever been. We soon did move in with his mother again and after she had threated me multiple times for little to no reason with it all being voice recorded, we were forced to leave while they were asleep to my mothers house. I had forgotten why i had left in the first place but had a bad feeling about it. It was good at first. I had hope. But after a bit the manipulation, the degration and all started again. While we were on a trip i was dehydrated. She said ""if i have to take you to the hospital with everything going on im going to be pissed"" i then started to cry. I felt helpless. I couldnt fix the fact i was dehydrated. She then said ""oh dont start that shit"" and left the bathroom. I fell asleep crying that night with the realization of why i had first left.. Not to mention, being in my hometown wanted to make me leave more. Now were back and i want nothing more than to sell anything i dont need, and leave. I miss it all. Yes it was hard but it gave me more freedom and happiness than all of the other places i had been. Im so depressed right now.. I feel stuck again. I feel like the only thing i can do now is just sell what i can, make a plan and go. I feel my depression and anxiety eating at me more and more everyday. Especially when my mother starts fights out of nowhere from things that happen days ago. And especially when she does what she just did, my fiance was playing vr and she wrote on a note ""he looks ridiculous wtf"" and whispered to me ""hes a moron"" i was dumbstruck. I have to go.

I live in my car, which is a huge upgradr from the last time I was homeless. But I have lasting anxiety and ptsd from my past. I was making my way down to Texas, and really pushing myself today on distance. I made it about 5 hours out from my destination and noticed I needed gas. 

I was in the middle of nowhere and it was getting dark FAST. (I have a really really bad time driving at night, my vision is terrible) my GPS brought me through a few towns that looked totally abandoned and broken down, and finally I came to the gas station my phone directed me too. The pumps were super old and I didn't understand how to use them, which made me feel suuuuper dumb. They also required Going inside to pay. 

Between that and the night completely blinding me I went into a massive panic attack. I have no idea where I am, and it's dark, and there's not alot of people around. 

When I went in I noticed the gambling machines  and got a few cups of instant noodles, my cat waiting impatiently for me to get back. I asked a few of the women in there if they knew of overnight parking and  they had no idea, like maybe a park near the lake or something. But it was so dark I could hardly see 5 ft infront of me even with my headlights (this small town had no streetlights) after paying for my snacks and gas I went out to go pump it, and simply couldn't figure out the way this pump worked, after about 2 minutes I gave up and went back inside to ask for help, my head hung low in shame. 

A dude who didn't work there came out to help me with it, I asked him if he knew any safe places for the night. He asked me how long I'd be there and I said just enough to get sleep (planning to leave around 5 am tomorrow to make sure I'm not a burden) He told me he lived across the street and as long as I was just catching a few hours of sleep I could stay in front of the store under his place. It's well lit and had cameras and would totally be safe. It's now almost midnight and I can say I feel safer than I did at random Walmart parking lots. 

It may not seem like a huge thing, but just being able to rest after 8 hours of driving and being both mentally and physically exhausted really made my night. So thank you mystery dude, you really saved my ass tonight. Even looking on the map this place isn't really near anywhere populated, and it's amazing to know that I have permission to park here and won't be woken up with a cop knock or some kid trying to break in. He didn't even judge me when he offered and it almost brought me to tears.",Anne_sao,85,1,12,1488

pwf9to,"How Does It Make You Feel To Understand That Your Very Presence Alone Anywhere Makes All Nearby Property Plummet In Value? Is this the Is This Ultimate In Dis-Affirmation and Shaming! Think about it for a second to feel just how powerful this statement is. You a homeless person. A person living with drug addiction, a prostitute trying to survive. An alcoholic drowning is sufferings. An ex convict society has thrown away. An out of work or under paid person drained of sufficient resources needed to remain housed. You all being homeless share one immense stigmatizing super power in the financially driven real estate marketplace.

You just by the act of being homeless anywhere alone but especially in mass reduce the value, quality of life and desirability of entire neighborhoods. Stigma's true destructive power is the effect it has on the selfish greedy fearful financial psychology better off people use to assign value to neighborhoods, housing and its inhabitants. The most hurtful stigma is that employed by the so called free market. Stigma against homeless people manifested in financial markets take the form of red-lining, property taxes that determine quality of support for school funding. A so called ""good neighborhood"" is the result of financial psychology exercised in the free markets poor people have almost no access to.

The capitalist free market corrects for social justice warrior diversity \\ inclusiveness initiatives using fiscal racism, homophobia, transphobia, anti homeless, slut shaming and other stigmas. The last festering bastion of oppressive stigma thrives within the very core of free market capitalism. Free markets governed by rich financial analyst's respond soon as a location in a former upscale area is ""zoned"" for public housing, a dope treatment center or a flop house. There is money in the churn from an area going from rich to poor or poor area to rich. The process of ghettofication starts before the first affordable housing brick is laid for poor tenants.

My concern runs deeper. How does it make you feel to be so hated that your very presence as homeless people whatever the cause is enough to make good people with great jobs and happy kids sell their homes and move away to avoid you. How does it make you feel to be chronically unwelcome. It's like having the superpower of making everything nice in an area rot and decay into gut wrenching poverty. The capitalist free market makes this process not only possible but extremely agile. The two economic processes both driven by stigma are Gentrification and Ghettotization.  The free market does not care because it makes money either way on what is called, ""The Churn."" When neighborhoods transition either way real estate and related consumer activities generate demand and fees. Homeless people are actually good for the economy because you keep well off people moving.

- told me to apply to all the banks her friend is apart of (almost like a district manager)

- gave me her phone number in case anything happened or if I get an interview she could help me practice with her

- bought my mom and I lunch from panera 

- gave my mom a cane from the back (our main clientele is older and a lot of canes have been forgotten lol)

- essentially said I have to go to the offices in person and hire a disability lawyer due to the lack of responses we've gotten

- GAVE ME $300 CASH. I tried to refuse and give it back because holy shit that's a lot of money, but she insisted

- told coworkers about our situation. They are trying to gather money for us to help us get something and will also bring in food for us. They even offered to get us a microwave and hot plate if we stay in a hotel and don't have one

- coworker is offering us to stay with her for 30 days. She and her husband have a basement suite with a full kitchen and bathroom. There is one bedroom and she is willing to put a twin mattress in there for me. She and her husband want it in writing and it is only for the 30 days due to her family coming for the holidays, which is perfectly fine as I should have another job by then hopefully.

ps4fu6,"Is It Me Or Do Most Street Homeless People Look More Distressed & Sick Than They Used To 30 to 40 Years Ago? Ok I am an OLD man now approaching my mid 60's at high warp speed. I remember back in the 1980's \\ 1990's when homelessness exploded after Ronald Reagan cut the budget destroying the US health and welfare infrastructure. Back then I did not have a job because I was autistic still learning to be social enough to thrive in the workplace.

I used to volunteer helping the homeless full time in the 1980's so I saw homeless people everyday back then. Back then street homeless people weren't as dirty, did not smell as much and they weighed more in general. In the 1980's street homeless wore clothes you know were donated but they were clean. I used to meet street homeless guys in McDonalds every morning to take them to get ID or whatever else they needed. They might look rough but they looked presentable and were sort of happy even.

Please I am not putting ANYONE from today DOWN! I'm worried because, today I see so many street homeless today who just don't look as healthy, hopeful, well dressed, bathed and alert. It's almost as if society has become far more brutal to street homeless people. I am NOT blaming street homeless people I am blaming society. To put a finger on exactly what I think is different. In the 1980's street homeless people did not look so ABUSED by the society back then.

In the 1980's life on the streets was easier it seems and it shows in how people look. I just find it heart breaking that Street Homeless today looks much more painful, demeaning and lonely. If this is so what can we do to improve this. Back in the 1980's homeless people would talk to me and ask for help. Now it almost seems homeless people are afraid to engage housed people. I mean some homeless people will engage me but so many seem so broken inside. I was just wondering is it me or has their been a seed change in Street Homelessness that accounts for the pained states I see?",AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,116,1,11,964
prowqv,"""WE'RE ALL JUST ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS!"" is the dumbest statement I hear so often! I feel the oversimplification in the ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" is the dumbest group of words ever spoken on the issue of homelessness. ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless unless we are NOT!"" Let's be real Jeff Bezo's is not one paycheck away from homelessness. Moreover relatively secure jobs do still exist in IT, medicine, engineering and other knowledge worker skilled labor type jobs.

""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" IF the WE in question have moderate to low skill jobs in fields where there is low to no demand and a glut of willing workers. If you are in a field  where workers are both needed and in short supply you can walk away from any job and find another. Pensions still exist for some older folk or again those whose skills are highly sought after.

Some people own their home and saved all their well paid working lives. Now in retirement they have money enough socked away to insure homelessness won't be a problem. There are so many instances where people go their entire lives without even a nodding acquaintance with street homelessness.

The ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" narrative does a utter disservice to homeless people because, it speaks only to the vulnerable precarious plight of the working poor and barely middle class worker. Yes people fall into homelessness from 6 and 7 figure careers. Yes it does happen but rarely. Lightening also strikes twice in the same spot if only rarely, but don't bet on it.

However the majority of passersby scurrying to their homes, workplaces, businesses or the mall will never experience street homelessness they ignore everyday. The ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" does not speak directly and convincingly to so many who will never live this experience. The people we must WAKE UP are those who are living in their bubbles of serene housed privilege NOT at GREAT RISK of ever becoming street homeless.

""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" lets stably housed classes of skilled knowledge workers, retirees and others off the hook in taking responsibility of caring for homeless neighbors. ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" gives those who are NOT one paycheck away from being homeless the rationale that lets them ignore street homeless suffering.

In my opinion ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" absolves stably housed upper middle class folks from caring about homeless people. I say don't care about homeless folk dying on the streets because of the lie that ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless."" NO! We ALL should care about the homeless dying on our streets because they are F\*\*KING HUMAN BEINGS who need your help and even more so if you are blessed to be so well off that being homeless is never likely to be your fate.

""To whom MUCH is given MUCH is expected."" is the saying I feel should totally replace ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless."" We should expect MUCH of those in power who control millions that could be used to end homelessness. We should expect MUCH of those whose jobs \\ careers, fiscal stability are such that a fall into street homelessness is all but impossible. We should expect MUCH of those who in retirement want for nothing. Simply we should expect MUCH from those who are NOT EVEN one or two or 10 or NO paychecks away from being homeless.""

I am so sick and tired of hearing fools sputter out ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" making it seem like we all have the same breaks in life. Yes for a great many ""WE ARE all just one paycheck away from being homeless!"" Yet for a MANY upper income folk MUCH IS GIVEN AND MUCH IS EXPECTED that has not materialized because we never call them out of their selfish privilege bubbles till now! If ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" we'd all have the same opportunities in life, the same financial situation, the same educational attainment, the same network of opportunities, the same empowering \\ enlightened upbringing, the same quality schooling, the same access to quality food, housing, utilities, internet and the same intrinsic skill sets, mental capacities and more. The myth that everyone in the US starts with the same advantages on a level playing field is A BIG FAT AUDACIOUS LIE! As my great grandmother used to say!

No the ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" is wrong because (adjusted for institutional economic racism.) most of those born to privilege keep privilege all their lives. Most people born to privilege have access to upper income social networks, contacts, opportunities and resources that people who truly are one paycheck away from being homeless will never have. ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" perpetuates the lie that we are all in this together.  Just like COVID19 you had people video chatting from fabulous homes with sub-zero fridges in the background saying we are all in this together. NO WE ARE NOT ALL IN THIS TOGETHER THAT IS A LIE!

Too many of us are dying on the streets just outside your gated communities. Too many of us and dying in hospitals of a deadly cocktail of COVID19, spent bodies and poverty. We are and were not in the COVID19 fight together any more than, ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless."" Stop repeating media spin lies that absolve the upper middle and upper classes who fight to keep you out of their neighborhoods and suffering on these streets. When you say ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" you are blaming the poor for circumstances not of their own making that they were powerless to avoid.",AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,0,1,11,964

So the ambulance came and took me to the emergency room of the local hospital, they gave me some iv thing that calmed me right out and i slept there for a few hours, but they had to let me go around 4am.

pmm7c3,"Does anyone have a ""tent life"" success story? I've been homeless on and off for 2-4 years. I've tried it all. Sleeping on benches, shelters, sidewalks, docked yachts, and tents but it's always been pure hell.

Whether its the heat or the cold, or the security guards or having my camp destroyed/looted..it never works out. I always end up desperate, half crazy, and absolutely miserable.

 I live in Florida and in the Summer 90 degree mosquito filled nights are the worst. I'm in a pretty big city and there's tons of tweaker/crack head homeless who are always looking for their next score. As a result, finding a decent and quiet (undiscovered) patch of woods is almost impossible. Even if my gear doesn't get jacked, the police and their helicopters have nothing better to do than Kick me out. Literally every forest area I find has already been populated by generations of homeless and it seems impossible to find something safe and secure.

Found a prime piece of land directly across the street from a shopping mall and on the ocean. That was a dream, but there were 4-5 other people on the property and the cops tracked me down after a few months. After that I set up a tent behind walmart with a bunch of other folks and had my tent and gear looted daily.

Im in a position now where I'm making about $45k a year. That equals about $900/week but I'm stuck paying $1600/month for a 10×12 slum hotel room in a BAD area. This place is so tiny and old it only has 2 outlets and even my pet cat can't stand the lack of space. I could easily afford a luxury condo for the same price but theres no way for me to save the $3000-4000 deposit money and nobody is going to help me.

Every week I get a little closer to just pulling the trigger and buying a tent. Winter is coming soon and at least the bugs and heat wont be an issue. I have a cat so that is also a big concern..hes strictly indoors and is deadly afraid of the ""outside"" but maybe a big enough tent could fix that. I would hate to go to work and find him and the tent slashed up or gone..so location is key I guess.

ph2nzh,"IF YOU WERE STREET HOMELESS WOULD YOU RATHER SLEEP ON A CLOSET FLOOR THAN A SHELTER? Hello all. First thanks for being willing to put up with me and my responses. I know I am not the best person in the world. I am autistic and weird.

Ok that said. I live in a nice luxury place, very safe, air conditioned in Summer, Heated in Winter. Two bathrooms. Two bedrooms but I use one bedroom as an office since working from home due to COVID19. I have a friend who is street homeless. He too is autistic and hates shelters, the rules, the people, the touching, the noise, the drama. He has a secret sleeping spot but I know where it is.

I consider him more than an acquaintance but not quite a true friend. He is not a dope addict. He is an ex convict BUT over time I found he can be trusted not to steal from me or hurt me. He is not city slick he is more a country boy forced to come into the city for homeless support services. He lives in the county because he got hurt bad physically and mentally by bad people in the city.

I see him at the local library often trying to sleep and getting kicked out. I talked to him over coffee at the library. Yes our library is so posh it has a small Starbucks like coffee shop on the second level. We got to be sorta friends and on bad weather, super hot or cold days I let him sleep in one of my walk in closets.

Now my walk in closets are air conditioned in Summer \\ Heated in Winter. Roomy enough to stretch out on a wrestling mat. I provide him with clean bed clothes. I wash his clothing and keep all his personal items \\ stuff here so he does not have to walk the streets with it all in a pack back. Sometimes I feed him because I can afford it and he is good company.

My problem is I feel bad letting him sleep on a mat on my walk in closet floor by day. I put him out on the streets by night since, I'm gone to stay with my big fat autistic brother at night. On the other hand he looks so much better now that he gets a solid 10 hours of sleep and fed twice a day by me. The poor dear heart sells his blood and wants to use the proceeds to pay me rent for my walk in closet floor space. I won't charge him rent or take money that's ridiculous. My question stems from the fact he is so happy he almost vibrates when he lays down for the day.

He swears to me that laying in my walk in closet all day is the best thing ever. He says to use his wording, ""I know personally about 12 homeless guys that would give their left nut for this setup!""

Finally my question... IS HE LYING TO ME about sleeping on my walk in closet being so good and most homeless folk would love the arrangement I just explained above. I can't imagine being so tired and hurt street homeless that a red wrestling mat in a climate controlled walk in closet is like Winning the Lottery again his words. If I am wrong set me straight in the comments and don't be gentle.",AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,110,1,3,1530

I didn't sleep last night. I sat behind a racetrac all night....

I'm scared. 

My boyfriend of 2 years has abused me...gas lighted me, made me lose everything.

I had a job and was living with him. He started off verbal...turned physical.

I've had my jaw fractured twice. A broken toe that calcified and doesn't bend anymore. Black eyes. A ruptured ear drum....

I'm no longer the same person I was before I met him. I haven't had a job in a year. He never let me leave the house.


I haven't had a phone in 6 months. I bought a phone from the dollar store but I couldn't afford service. 

He hacked into my account. Locked my PayPal. My Venmo. My chime. All I have left is cashapp.

I have been secretly selling nudes on the side and he found out...it was the final blow.

He kicked me in the face. He threw away everything I owned.

I called the cops. They didn't arrest him.

I ran. I ran. And I ran. I don't know where I am. 

I don't feel safe. The only shelter near by was full. 

There's no busses out here. 

I only have the clothes on my back and this tracphone with no service.

My skin hurts so bad.

I want to sleep. I want to lay down. I want to feel safe.


What do I do???? 

I can't get a taxi because I don't have any money.

I can't get an Uber because I don't have a phone number.

I can't get a hotel because he threw away my ID.

I can't buy a tent. Food. Or aloe for my sunburn.

I'm so lost.

I have no direction.

I feel sick. I have no family around. Parents are out of state and old and can barely support themselves.

p6khkz,"The shelter I live in went from tolerable to unsustainable in only 3 months. As usual, staff doesn't care. I've been living in a homeless shelter for young people for 9 months. When I first got here, this was a decent place by shelter standards. Sure there were some people who were on drugs, the area outside was dangerous, half of the shelter was designated for older residents who were mostly trouble makers and weren't the most pleasant people to have to share a gated complex with. But the majority of people living in my building were average people, nobody stole, we had functional showers and laundry facilities, the building was clean, living conditions were tolerable. I used my time here to get mental health treatment, get a job, and get a section 8 voucher. I'm in the process of finding an apartment now.


However this shelter has completely gone to shit, all in a matter of months. When all of the staff quit in May and the executive director changed, I knew we were in for some bad shit. But I did not imagine such rapid deterioration. This week we made local news for having the largest Covid-19 outbreak in the city, but this is only the tip of the iceberg of the disastrous mismanagement going on behind these barbed wire gates. All of our living facilities are in disrepair. My building has rats. There are fights every single day. The food is not edible. Staff stands there and does nothing. Why are they even here? Aren't they getting paid to maintain this place? 


The last straw for me was when 2 meth addicts who are living in my building conspired to smuggle a gun in from some outside location and shoot the place up. They didn't know I could hear them. I've overheard these 2 say a lot of nasty shit, ok. I hear them talking about drug deals, prostitution, stealing from other residents, threatening to stab or jump or pepper spray other residents, they are both absolute garbage human beings. One of them has been here longer than I have, she has no job, no income, no plans to move out, she sits around and smokes meth all day. She is literally the poster child of ""bad homeless person"" the media loves to portray us all as. I have ignored both of them for months and months on end, never talked to anybody or gotten involved with anybody. But when I heard them say they had a gun and intended on shooting and killing people (btw security does not check our bags and we have no metal detectors at the gate) I recorded them and showed the recording to the staff. The staff did not take it seriously so I made a police report. The police said they can't do anything and these 2 pieces of shit are still living in there. The last contact staff made with me they tried to tell me I was the one in the wrong for recording them making terroristic threats because it was ""a private conversation"" and that I was ""slandering their names."" 


In what fucking world does that make any sense? How do you look at 2 drug addicts who contribute NOTHING to society, constantly steal and fight, and prioritize them over someone who has a job, has used the program to stabilize, move on to independent living, never gotten in a fight or had a single complaint filed against them? I can leave, rent a hostel while I transition to an apartment, it's nothing but a pain in the ass to me but not life ruining. However it pisses me off that this is the way this multi billion dollar system is being ran. Prioritizing and enabling shitty people with no future over people who have a chance at actually benefiting from that funding. 


What goes through the minds of these social workers when they make these decisions? They are all young, upper class, left leaning millenials. They aren't crazy, they seem like rational people from an outside perspective, they're educated. How do they rationalize the way they are running this place? Do they think they're doing the right thing, do they even care at all? 


Maybe I'm just yelling into the void here, I'm sure I'm not the only person who lived this experience. But I have to get it out to somebody. It's like I'm being made to feel like I'M the crazy one here.",130UniMaron0,100,2,9,1231

Last night some tweaker opened up my tent and stuck a knife to my throat telling me not to move as he dug around looking for anything to steal. When he realized he had nothing he went quiet for a few seconds and left hastily yelling profanities.

I knew back then that even watching movies about it I can’t handle grief when my cat died I couldn’t get out of bed for 3 days and this was before I had the realization that death is a concept and I’m not just being abandoned or they’re “gone”.

ojky51,"hot take from r/denver - thoughts? there will be no ""eradicating the homeless"". It is also an impossible goal to ""just house them"".

I've worked in a homeless shelter, and within the jail system. When I tell you a LARGE chunk of the homeless don't want responsibility, I am not talking out of my ass.

The working homeless- ya know, the ones that actually want to get out of homelessness...you don't see them..and why is that? Because they are in the shelters, taking advantage of programs to get out of their situation. They are at work DURING THE DAY, not on the street. They are participating in care plans with a human services worker, they are not the ones begging for money, or stealing your bike.

The severely mentally ill, and drug addicted homeless are the ones camping, taking up sidewalks, using needles, defecating on the streets and harassing you all. I have worked with both types of homeless people. One WANTS the responsibility of paying bills and living a pro social life, the other one doesn't. I have worked and worked and busted my ass to get some of these guys on the streets, real housing vouchers. Not the temp hotel vouchers, I mean the vouchers from Salvation Army, MDHI, Denver Rescue Mission. Vouchers that give them the golden ticket to a furnished place to live, and the ONLY caveat is that they participate in treatment and case management. I have also offered some greyhound tickets back to their home state.

Off my memory I can think of 15 vouchers I recieved to hand out to clients during my time working with the homeless. Want to know how many of them took their housing voucher when I let them know the exciting news? Two, just two. One guy even admitted he had no plans to get better because he made ""too much from panhandling"" The guy would come back to the shelter with tons of junk food and hundreds of dollars and flaunt it to the rest of the guests staying there.

I hate to even say this, but the sweeps are necessary. You could hand some of these people their way out of homelessness and the thought of being responsible will make them decline the offer. It's all about self determination. I can't force them to be pro social, no one can. You can only hope that they hit rock bottom and get so tired of moving place to place that they either cave and get help, or relocate to a state that doesn't shuffle them around.",HomelessOnReddit,20,2,2,97

nlqlcs,"Me being me... I've been living up inside of my my cramped Ford Focus for around ten days now. After ditching the shelter, I balled out on DoorDash and made just under a grand for the week compared to the week before at $600. Was able to put most of it away and been looking at rooms to rent.

Checked out a few rooms that people are renting out from their homes, but I'm not sure yet. I got a few barriers until I'll be able to get an apartment, but it's doable. The people who rent rooms around here have all been nice so far but I'm down to continue roughing it until something suitable arises.

A job at this grocery store warehouse was supposed to start tomorrow, but then the HR people called and pushed it back for no reason. I was ready to spend time working, but now I gotta wait. 

So, like old me, I went and grabbed a joint from the dispensary. 

The last time I got high, it was from vaping and it really made me freak out. It was a case of taking ""too much"" and the head high with vaping was like that old commercial where the guy goes ""here's your brain - here's your brain on drugs"" as eggs crackle and sizzle on an all-too-hot frying pan. I was having bad paranoia and also feelings of despair.

However, after smoking this joint (in place of vaping): I feel good, man. I grabbed a chicken sandwich from McDonald's, which tasted more like a sponge than anything noticeable to my pallette, in an attempt to cut my buzz down because being too high and trying to work delivery don't my mix. 

Hit the library next to take a three hour break so I'm not out there on the road all lit up.

I know it wasn't the most genius of me to partake, but that's what I did in the face of stress with the job getting pushed back. I have very real triggers that I have to work on.

I don't think I can chase the magical dragon daily anymore. But damn if I get too stressed: anything could happen.

I'm ready to hit the road again for work and then rest at the Walmart parking-lot afterward. I'll do better tomorrow.",JoeRMD77,82,1,12,1488

I ended up going to planet fitness today. While I'm confident enough most of the time, I get fairly anxious trying to do new things.

I was homeless for almost 2 years back in 2014 and have since opened a garage and became a notary public. 

While homeless i realized how much help was just not there for people in rough situations and the help that was there if any was just a pain in the ass to get.

I plan on opening a store front with a recycling center in the back and my wife and i will only be hiring homeless to get tham back on their feet. 

We plan to offer financial education and budgeting as well as a job and a place to eat shower and job hunt. We cant offer shelter due to insurance purposes but we are trying to find a work around on that. 

When i was homeless the only way i got back on my feet was i went to a local church and asked if i could use their shower and clean up in order to go and look for work and to be presentable. In return i offered to clean and maintain the church and its property lawn mowing, building repairs ect. They agreed and i was back on my feet about a month later. 

Now i want to do the same but the town ship offers no help due to the fact it doesn't benefit them. 

We have a go fund me with a little more info on our plan we havent really put it out their much but there really seems to be no one that is willing to support the idea. 

Long story short one way or another my wife and i plan on making this work and if you are homeless in the NEPA (North Eastern Pennsylvania Area) and would like to work with us on this project please let us know we are going around to different programs and charities to see what we can do to get everything going before the next cold season hits. 

Let me know how you all feel about this idea and if you have any suggestions on how we might be able to find the funding or resources to make it possible.

n0i0cu,"Me (25M) and my fiancée (23F) become homeless next week. No government help (Germany). Im gonna keep it very short otherwise i have to write a book.
I have no parents and no family and not really friends.
I have a mental health disorder (strong generalized anxiety disirder, adhd and ptsd).

My fiancée grew up with a clinical psychopath as a father who after 8 years of us together ""finally"" cut her off and put her on the streets.
With cutoff I mean left to die.
She was/ is heavily manipulated from him so she can’t defend herself in any situation, it’s getting a little bit better tho when she finally cut him off and realize how much of a tyrant he is.

I can’t work and don’t get government help (I had it for 3 years).

Her father did some traumatizing things, very illegal ones...can’t really talk about it. But we got tortured for 2 months.

We cut off every connection with her family (very small family, everybody ""escaped"" the psychopath). She still has a good relationship with her mother but she is on the edge of being homeless aswell.

After the terrific and traumatic actions her father did she went into a psychward so she can get government help first and then therapy. Problem is, nothing is coming through because her father is all lawyerd up. We went to the police multiple times, many courts etc. 
but he’s a **very very very rich motherfucker.**

-We got no government help (we went to ALL places that could help, no help)

-We don’t have any food and steal/eat rest overs from the local hospital 

-we will end up in big debt because we weren’t insurancesd

-I am sadly dependent on medication, not taking it could kill me 

-our mental health is very very very bad 

-it’s logical seen senseless and there is actual no hope. We are aware of this situation for a longer time now and tried everything.
It’s all lawyerd up, no chances

-if we don’t get food/ money/ medication soon we are forced into illegal stuff, we really really don’t want to. But if we are starving we will go hunt and steal


Since we don’t want to give up on life our plan is to go into the woods. When I was around 20 i did a lot of survival stuff and i also grew up in the most criminal town in germany. A switch between the Forrest and city..

What should we taking care for? I know what to have in our backpacks and i can hunt and defend ourselves. We need to get away from her father because of the abuse and crimes he’s doing...new names would really help.

So we’re heading into the woods very soon but we sadly have to leave our beloved cat behind (my fiancée mother will take care of her).

We don’t want to be spotted, we need to disappear otherwise her father will do crimes again. We’re gonna try it one more time with police and court, if it doesn’t work we are heading into freedom, even if it’s uncomfy.

I also have a question for people from Germany/ Europe. Is there a nearby land where we could start a new life easier, where her father can’t do anything and the government is not as ""bürokratisch"" as in Germany?

At least we are together

mz270j,"I was homeless for over 10 years of my life, now I'm a long haul trucker, still homeless, but make over 5k per month after taxes. And I got my CDL for free. Here is how you can do it too. Only a few things will make it harder to get your CDL.

1. Actively addicted/using any drugs. Do not even bother if you're using drugs. Marijuana included.

2. Recent DUIs(last 5 years)

3. Reckless driving convictions.

As far as other felonies, most won't matter. I have a friend that did 17 years for attempted murder and he got a job right out of CDL school.

I wasn't homeless when I got my CDL, I was in section 8 housing at the time. I was unemployed, so I went to my unemployment office and applied for what is called the WIOA grant. A few hoops to jump through but it was pretty easy. They paid $5000 for my CDL school.  This is the best option because you're not beholden to a company for a year or whatever.

The easiest way to get your CDL is to call up a company like Prime, Swift, Knight, CR England, Roehl, CRST etc. Apply for their CDL schools. You end up with a job right out of school, most of them pay you whole you're in school too. 

School is usually 3-4 weeks long, and on the job training is another 3 to 6 weeks. But you're getting paid for all of that. I got paid $800 per week to train at my current company. 

The starter companies that help you get your CDL don't pay very well, 500-800 per week is common, but after 6 months to a year your job options open up. I'm almost 8 months in, once I hit my year of experience I'm moving to a company that will pay about 30 percent more than I'm making right now. So I'll be making 7k to 8 k per month, after taxes.

mtllhf,"Will full acceptance of marijuana use, legalization, contribute to homelessness? *Hope we can have a reasonable discussion on all this:*

Article: [Does Recreational Marijuana Legalization Contribute to Homelessness?](https://reason.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/homelessness-effect-of-marijuana.pdf)  This writing offers calm, nuanced conclusions.  Excerpts:

>While there is evidence that homelessness has increased in states that have legalized marijuana, it is not clear that this is primarily the result of legalization. Data from the two states to first implement legalized recreational marijuana use— Washington (2013) and Colorado (2014)—suggest that homeless rates increased dramatically following legalization...

>Plausibly, some of the rise in homelessness in Washington and Colorado has been an indirect consequence of legalization of marijuana, which has contributed to robust economic growth and in-migration. Anecdotally, homeless shelter managers report that some homeless persons from out of state indicate they have migrated to work in the marijuana industry—a cohort casually known as “trimmigrants.”

>Islands of recreational marijuana legalization, such as Colorado, Washington and Oregon are likely to experience initial higher in-migration due to job opportunities caused by booming economies. High migration increases demand for limited supplies of housing, which results in higher home prices, pricing some out of the market and into homelessness. 

- - - -

Reasonable conclusions.  But pursuing the topic further, might we conclude there is more of a *Yes* answer? A homeless crises  results from two things: 1) People falling into homelessness and 2) Homeless being unable to climb out of their condition.

We know that marijuana is minimally debilitating to users.  It would be extreme to suggest marijuana use ever caused someone to fall into homelessness.  But what about people who *are already homeless* from the conventional reasons:  hard drugs and alcohol, mental issues, and economic hardship?  

And some are smoking weed every day, much of the day. No surprise people are doing this: Marijuana is accorded a long list of benefits: helps with anxiety and PTSD, benefits people with depression, relieves chronic pain, and is seen as a safer alternative to opioids. [link](https://www.health.com/condition/pain/marijuana-benefits-risks) 

Is daily smoking going to help homeless develop a mindset to try to get their life in order, find work and housing?   Or does daily marijuana smoking for some people just continue the status quo, which in some cases is *a cruising lifestyle?*  (This procrastination can apply to housed unemployed persons also.)

mq0vt5,"Formerly homeless. I'm not doing well in housing. I don't know what else to post this I've been housed by an agency in a nice apartment for about six months. It has helped with some aspects of my addiction recovery and mental health. I have maintained sobriety for two years. I have a caseworker visiting once a week. I have an emotional support cat. And I have the internet. This is pretty much everything I have in my life right now and I just feel so empty.

I'm an advocate for housing first and I understand that it is a necessary step to start addressing many of the other underlying issues that I was struggling with and that contributed to my homelessness. But I'm realizing now that it's just the beginning and I am still just an absolute mess of a person unfit to be in society. I was naive to think that housing would fix everything. I don't know where to go from here. My caseworker make sure that my Medicaid is up-to-date and helps me schedule appointments and things but because of covid my access to Mental Health Care has been severely limited. Support groups are not meeting. My therapist has such a huge case load and so do all the other therapies at the agency that we can barely get an appointment once a month and that's only over the phone they don't even do Zoom.

Oh yeah here I am and I've been the house for six months and you would think it would be great. But all of the old symptoms from before I was homeless and before I was addicted are coming back. During my addiction and homelessness I was in survival mode. I was having extreme social anxiety and regular general anxiety and panic attacks and PTSD episodes all the time. Now in the apartment I have not had a panic attack or a PTSD episode more than once in this whole six months. I used to have them almost everyday out on the street. The only time I had one in the apartment was when my ex-boyfriend was here abusing me. But my case worker helped me go no contact with him.

So there was a lot good going on. The abuser is out of my life. Legal action has been taken against him. I got a new car. I have a house. I haven't done any mess in 2 years. I quit smoking cigarettes a month ago my case worker say I am their best case and I am the easiest client and the most independent but I really feel like I'm just about to crash and burn again. I feel this massive anxiety that something is going to go wrong. And everyday I have nothing in my life. All of my street friends are toxic and I just can't be around them without having panic attacks. And I don't have the money to join real Society to do things like go to clubs and restaurants to meet real people. So I'm just here on the internet and I'm finding that now instead of panic attacks I'm just so sad and so broken. Even the tiniest little internet comment can put me in tears. So I'm feeling extremely sad and rejected all the time based on every time I reach out through social context. One half of it is just rude people on Reddit. I'm in tears even trying to write about it. What is wrong with me. My life is great and paid for it. I am totally taken care of. But I am so sad. I almost want to go back to anxiety and PTSD episodes because at least somebody sometimes it would stop if they saw me having an episode on the street they would ask if I was okay and I don't have that now. Or even if somebody was mean to me because I was having an episode on the street somebody else would yell at the person being mean to me it made me feel like a human being sometimes and now I just kind of feel invisible. I survived on the street and now I am wrecked by internet comment? I just want to say that housing first isn't the only solution. I don't know what kind of help I need but just because I'm in a house and off drugs doesn't mean I'm in a good place to rejoin Society. I feel completely unfit to join Society I'm actually kind of afraid to go out of the house because any time I run into any conflict whatsoever I just break down into a panic PTSD puddle. And then I get accused of relapsing when it's really just a panic attack and so I would rather not interact with people based on everything but they keep telling me to go out and join society and be more social and it just terrifies me. The kinds of things I would be interested in doing socially like I did back when I used to be a normal person are no longer available because of social distancing. There is Community Theater and I thought about joining that but they have kids and I really don't want to be around children because I have had children's parents take their children away from me because I was having a panic attack saying that I am an unsafe person and I just don't want to expose myself to those innocent people. I just don't feel fit to join Society anymore even though I've mean taken care of it's like it's almost like I've been put out of sight so that nobody has to deal with me I've never felt like a real human being ever since being homeless. I'm housing I still feel like this trash",_ism_,92,1,12,1488

Title says it all summed up but heres a rundown.

I was my moms caregiver (main job) for years since I was a teen, until she passed December 18th 2020. Two weeks after my moms death my grandparents suddenly cut off all money. I could no longer afford food or my meds.
By January 31st I was homeless. I got kicked out by my grandparents who own the house. They only gave me a week to figure out what to do but still forced me out. 

In February I thought I had found a friend of mine who was going to help me, but they decided to use up my cash, my ebt, knock me up, and dip. Leaving me alone again.

Its now April, I still cannot find a job. I have filed 200 applications in the past week alone. 90% of them are scams, and the others are just no call backs. From fastfood to freelancing. I’ve even had to suck dick for $20 to $30 to just have gas to stay warm at night. I don’t have enough money for the dmv to get a license or register my car. So every time I drive Im stressed out that I’ll lose everything again. I’ve exhausted my options from shelters to hotels to friends and family. Nobody can take me in or help me. I’m on my own, and terrified.

I have BP, BPD, PTSD, and Panic Disorder.
Sometimes I cant even go to the bathrooms across town because driving, and going in public gives me severe panic attacks I nearly pass out (my vision gets fuzzy and white). Imagine trying to drive during that? Not only is it terrifying but dangerous. I’ve had several bathroom accidents because there’s no way I can make it or have a place to go. I’ve been to the ER more times than I can count because of my disorders, but now being homeless has made it worse. 

I can’t even afford my bipolar meds (can I even take them while pregnant?) and I’ve called all the mental help places. They either won’t take my insurance, or they are booked till the fall. I even filed in January for disability but its going to be another month before they can even LOOK at it to try and push it through just to ATTEMPT to approve it.. God knows that will take even longer..

I’m going to either die in my car, because I cant function enough to survive. Or I kill myself because there’s no way out of this.

I’m so desperate for money, I’ve done sex work. Freelancing office work and writing. But its so far and few between, $20 here or $50 there doesn’t do much. Especially trying to find a small shitty place just to sleep at night. 

I’m at my lowest with no way up. Im exhausted and scared. Alone. I’ve tried to be good my whole life, I don’t drink or do drugs or fight with anyone. All I’ve ever done is help people and just try and live through my disorders.

I'm a university student currently doing research into what it takes for a homeless person to survive. I was hoping I could ask the awesome people of this community some questions to help with my study:

1. If a person was living wild (e.g. living in a tent), how much money would someone need per day to sustain their lifestyle? I know that this will depend on alot of personal factors, but if anyone could provide their opinions and experience, it would be much appreciated.
2. How does or can someone gain this level of income without a normalish job or government assistance? Is it normal to rely on handouts (i.e. busking, donations, etc?)  or do you guys and girls have other ingenious sources of income?

I know these seem like weird questions, but all data I can find is from those that are forced into bad situations, not those that choose the lifestyle for other reasons. So I'm more focused on a lifestyle sustainment income, rather than how much to change lifestyles. But in saying that, I'd love to hear anyones experience on the matter.

5 minutes ago..

Just waiting at the bus station. (Bus pass is $2) and a homless guy asked if I wanted to buy his because he said he was done with it for the day..I was skeptical but I figured ""yeah, why not? Rather give this guy money than the bus company.""

So I bought the pass and I happened to have a pizza I just picked up from dominos. So he said ""oh, you got pizza? Can I get some?"" I said yeah..take a couple of slices.""

He looked at the pizza (bacon/pineapple) and said ""I can't eat that shit"" and he walks away.

Here's the kicker..go to swipe the bus pass and its expired. He had rubbed out the ink so I couldn't see the date and driver said it was 2 days old. 

I mean, I can't be mad. I understand the desperation and the need..but I don't like the games these folks play. I'm homless myself and don't have much money. $2 isn't going to kill me, but there's a lot of stuff I need that I could use that for. Just sucks. Next time a legitimate person who needs the money is dealing with me, im gonna be twice as skeptical because you just can't trust people..",dirtydiva_girl,95,1,3,1530

m3z49j,"Boomers panhandling? Ok y’all I’m not homeless but I’ve noticed an increased number of boomers panhandling and I dunno if they’re destitute due to medical costs, lost job due to covid, or if it’s just an overall sign of the times. I’ve given money to two boomers this past week. I could tell they were completely harmless and just in a bad spot. I’m quite good at reading people. Of course, I’ve also had the drug addicted panhandler pop up on me at the gas station and I’ll give them pocket change just to go away, if I give them anything at all. I try to make sure I’m very cognizant of my surroundings- my high school boyfriend got stabbed in the back twice at a gas station about a decade ago. Scary stuff. But I’m also a very empathetic person. I have severe ulcerative colitis so I know what it is to be defeated and to lose your dignity and have your morale shattered, albeit in a lesser way. 

Anyway, about 4 days ago I went to the mall out of town and an older black lady popped up on me. I could tell she was just down on her luck. She said ‘you are the first one that’s smiled at me today. Thank god you aren’t prejudiced.’ That really hit me cause it must have been at least 4 in the afternoon.... to be destitute and not even receive so much as a smile most of the day has got to be harsh. I gave her a few dollars and asked her her name, where she was from, etc. She’s 60 years old with grandchildren. She reached out and touched my arm and said ‘I just have to make sure you’re real, and you really are in the flesh.’ I understand 99% of people may have recoiled but I just knew I was safe in her presence.

Today there was a couple in my hometown panhandling and they also appeared to be boomers. We don’t get panhandlers in my town often because people here either have no money or what little they do have, they don’t want to give it away. Lady was in a wheelchair holding a sign saying something about lupus and cancer, please help. Dude was with her holding a garbage bag of I guess their remaining items. I was on my way out and couldn’t talk but just gave them a few dollars instead.

I got back to thinking about going to the mall out of town Monday and honestly there were panhandlers all over the place, in most all parts of the town. Some were generation X but it seems like a majority were boomers. My boomer parents contracted covid months ago and my dad got laid off but I think they will be okay. I’m thousands of dollars in medical debt but I work and am getting an advanced degree so when I compare my problems to the panhandlers, my problems seem so insignificant. I wish I could do more to help out. 

Just curious if any of you have noticed this trend of the boomers asking for money. Something about it really gets to me emotionally because these people are moving into senior citizenry if they haven’t already. I’m not an emotional person but I fear for them and their safety and well being.",AnxietyFunTime,2,2,3,1530

lpee4y,"Thoughts on Hiring a Homeless Person To Shop at the Goodwill Outlet I've been selling on ebay full time since last June. I mostly source from the local thrift stores, and the rare estate sales. My area has about 10 Goodwills, and a goodwill outlet. I mostly source at the goodwills because the ones in my area get far more donations than the other thrift stores, and put out a lot more new stuff daily. I also source in a small town nearby once a week because a few of those thrift stores always provide good inventory for cheap. A rare edition bible worth $35  for .50 for example. 

In this business you have to rely on new things coming out as 90% of highly profitable inventory will be gone within hours. 90% of the stuff on YouTube are lies. 

Contrary to popular belief,  most of the stuff that ends up at the goodwill outlet never made it into a regular goodwill store shelf. The employees are idiots, and will reject a large collection of high end golf clubs because it isn't gulf season. They will turn around and think a broken Playstation 2 is gold. Guess where those golf clubs end up?

The idea is to hire someone locally to source the local outlet from 9-3 daily Monday- Friday which are the same hours I would spend driving around from one thrift to another. It would probably take 1-2 weeks of training on what to look for.  I meet them at 3 to buy their finds. I pay daily in cash. 

This would be a part time gig, and the pay would be based on finds, although I believe they should be able to make $10 per hour.. that's money for digging through junk as opposed to a real shit job like slaving away in a warehouse for Jeff Bezos. Thoughts?",kwyant38,3,1,12,1488

If someone came along who had a decent budget ($500,000 - $1M) and resources. 
What is your idea that would be most beneficial and help the most people in the homeless community. 

One idea I had....

Take 10 or so people that want to learn a trade, construction, plumbing, hvac, electrical, home inspection etc

Provide education and support to get them qualified. See up apprenticeships so they could gain the experience. 

Procure decent land and supplies and have the group construct buildings, homes etc. They then graduate and set out to build their lives. Basically, rinse and repeat. 
You could expand by opening a decent sized farm and employ more homeless to work there, build a community garden, send a few to become hairdressers, some to work in second hand shops. Etc etc. 

Basically, help people to learn skills, in return they apply those skills to improve the homeless community etc. 

Obviously, this is a very simplified version.

now that ive got that out of the way let me get right to the point. I want to end homelessness, or at the very least make it a moot point. i have an idea, and i was hoping that you guys (or anyone that will talk to me) would be willing to help me figure out a few things. you see if homelessness could just be cured by giving people homes than wed have done it. homes themselves are easy. its not that simple. well how do you know, you might ask? well lets just say this. in beverly mass the town right above salem mass the witch town, right behind the train station is a little yellow building and that building is, or atleast was the river house, a homeless shelter serving as many as 25 or more every day with basic needs and outreach. i spent 2 years living there. 

i know more than most that truly ending the homelessness that is plaguing our race is going to take people power. we need to be able to have a single person with acess to a depth of socail funds and resources for every person that either is or is in immenent danger of becoming homeless and they need to be able to act outside of any border. an army of vetted volunteers spanned across the world ready to act to help prevent a single human being from being out on the streets that doesnt want to be

my idea? H:E.L.P.   Homelessness: Engagement, Logistics, and Prevention. a socially funded non-profit organization that can operate without the constraints of a singular physical office by using state of the art (or at the very least up to date technologies) to provide immediate assistance to anyone in need who may either be homeless and incapable of changing there dynamic or who may through inability become homeless. and that assistance could be determined by a team of 3, two of whom go in the feild and one of whom enters the case at the point of review.

that all being said, my request if you will, is what types of services would actually be helpful and beneficul to actually helping people become not homeless. i mean, is there a number however astronomically high it might be that we could throw at the problem and make it go away? im curious to actually talk about this because i feel strongly that sometimes people will tout the issue of homelessness just to raise money, but for what? are we building new shelters? are we sending new cots or new socks and blankets? i want to takle the human lives that are suffering simply because they think they dont matter. so please help me understand better what the problems are so i can better understand how i can help",PonkKastle,1,1,9,1231

lezhln,"Making homelessness care packages - What should I be aware of? Hi everyone, I want to help out people who are homeless. I see quite a few of them when I'm out and about and well, I usually don't know what to do so I often just look away and keep moving. 

To combat this, I wanted to prep some care packages for the homeless people I see every now and then. My hope is this way I'll be better prepared to go up to, and help the homeless people around me (as long as it's safe.)  


Do you have any advice for what I should pack? This was the list I was going off of/considering:  
 

* Gallon plastic bag with zipper 
* Hand-written note card
* Printout of local resources
* Wool socks
* Water bottle
* Tuna cracker pack (or other snack)
* Nail clippers
* Some bandages
* Individually wrapped wet wipes
* Toothbrush, floss and toothpaste?
* Covid Mask?
* Some quarters for laundry/transport?

*^(-Credit to)* [*^(allgiftsconsidered.com)*](https://allgiftsconsidered.com) *^(for most of this list)*

For the socks, should I go aim mostly for quantity or quality? I've seen some people recommend going all the way on buying really nice socks, while other people say just buy cheap ones since a lot of homeless people won't have the opportunity to wash them. What do you suggest?  


In general, would a package like this be helpful for a homeless person? Let me know if there's a better use of my time and money for this purpose.  


Lastly, are there any other tips I should be aware of when interacting with homeless people? I understand I need to be wise and stay safe. Any advice for this?

l5f3xn,"Why WHY do people TRY and take EXPLOITATIVE ADVANTAGE of THOSE ALREADY STRUGGLING? This week, I was offered what seemed like a gift from the Universe.  A home to stay, a path forward, a step up out of the insanity of homelessness.  But because I am the skeptical sort, I did some digging.  A middle-aged woman pretending to put women in ""safe houses"" to get them away from the dire circumstances on the streets.  A woman who claims to be saving those who were ""sex trafficked"" ""domestic violenced"", ""prostituted"" etc.  I was a ""candidate"" for her program due to being a victim of a violent crime by a stranger last year.  I should have known when the ""application process"" went too quickly, too smoothly.  I became alarmed when I realized I would be sharing the home space with a woman who has had 9/9 kids taken away from her by the State due to meth addiction.  I became LEGITIMATELY in full on research mode when a woman pretending to help trafficked/addicted/abused women puts them in a ""safe house"" on a street with AT LEAST 5 known drug dealers and violent crime all around.  I did a background search on the property and the woman and have almost conclusive 100% proof she is actually a sex trafficker herself - putting those who trust her to ferry them to safety into sexual exploitation and further violence.  What a perfect cover, right? A middle aged woman talking about prayer and God and extending offers of housing to those who are obviously JUST FKN DONE being without 4 walls around them and are desperate for any good news/possible positive change to happen for them.  Yeah, lady - this ain't my first rodeo and you seriously suck posing as the savior when you're the assistant trafficker.  Finding pure evil in the World like this amidst people already struggling just to make it to the next day is infuriating.   So now I'm back to nowhere to go in snow/ice and freezing cold single digit temps.  The shelters here are not taking anyone new and have a reputation for being extremely dangerous/bug-infested and over the top obnoxious to the clients they say they serve.  Im first time homeless and honestly more pissed off right now than hopeless.  But the hopelessness settles around me in the dark at bedtime when I can't sleep and haven't eaten all day.  And yeah - I've applied for EVERYTHING.  Even got a Chime bank account so no more obnoxious bank $12 fees just for the ""crime"" of having no money in my bank account every month. What is the point of this post? Just to vent and hope people can relate and offer a kind word of hope right now, I guess.  People can seriously suck and the bad ones look for desperation and vulnerability and will prey upon it at every chance - a true wolf in sheep's clothing.  So be very careful out here, friends. Especially those new or somewhat new to being unhoused.  I may have no idea what I'm doing and I may have been handed a new life I have no idea how to navigate but I know exactly what I'm NOT GONNA DO and that is allow shitty people to take further advantage of my current dire circumstance.  So often I just want to say ""Fuck Humanity"" and quit.  Who wouldn't have that urge after the shit we witness on the daily that only further traumatizes us out here? Life is shit right now but I'm not about to let some alleged do-gooder make it an even bigger pile of shit for me.  Stay safe, friends.    And normally I'm very FTP because I have never seen ""all the good cops people are always talking about"" but have only seen the violent sadistic ones firsthand.  I am tempted to report this woman - but not to the local PD.  I'm going to call the sexual trafficking hotline and hopefully the DOJ or whoever handles that stuff will come down hard on this fake ass bitch exploiting the already exploited.

I am currently working on a research project, which has been approved by my university's Institutional Review Board (IRB), dedicated to understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people experiencing homelessness and am conducting a preliminary survey to guide future stages of the research.

Depending on the detail provided I anticipate it will take between 5-15 minutes. All information provided will be completely confidential (only shared with the rest of the research team). Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Thier siblings in law were a bit mean and ended up putting me in a shelter against what my friends parents wanted. It sucked and I had my siblings who went through the same ""help"" but everyone was making things worse. 

The shelter was lgbt+ only so the staff and roommates were good and helped me recover from trauma at home. But the shelter was ran by a terrible woman who made it so that I didn't have food or medicine and wasn't able to get to my appointments or interviews. 

I had no income from my documents stolen and I was misplaced from my friends after I was sent to the shelter. Even my siblings made it worse and moved my PCP way further out of reach.
I learned how to respect myself at the shelter and stand up to people trying to help me but not listening to me about the help I needed. 
Half a year of being homeless, scraping back my documents from scratch, and standing up to myself I finally have back all of my documents and I have been hired for 20 hrs! I have never had a job before!

I'm not posting to brag but I have been working so hard and pushed down so much and I wanted to celebrate and encourage others too.
I'm so happy I've been able to be resourceful. I am smart enough not to had let my parents have any money before I left and saved anything I could. They have stolen so much money from em as well. I don't know a thing about taxes or banks or anything I needed to know as an adult before I left so I'm so glad I have amazing friends who give me the help I needed and case managers who didn't belittle me or how much I know. I'm a very capable being and I thrived when people treated me like one.
I'm very privileged to have been able to be in those spots to have never needed to sleep on the street even when people told me I ought to and they didn't care. I proved those people wrong and I didn't give them the pleasure of putting me out during a pandemic because I had resources,smarts, and support! I am so privileged but I really don't want anyone to go through what I did. No one should have to face abuse or have to resort to emergency rooms for medical health or anything else. I went through a ton of dark times but I had my friends.

So, when the lockdown started we had loads of food we couldn’t sell and we decided that we should give this away to people in need in our city. Now we’ve given all this out, as well as some generous donations from our “fans” such as sleeping bags and warm clothes (winter, uk).

We want to keep this momentum going and have set up an online fundraiser which has already doubled what we’ve asked for. 

With this money we want to go and buy more food items and things like sleeping bags people need when struggling on the streets and/or with addiction.

l0alo1,"Impending doom In the past 4 years, I have been homeless 6-7 times. Each time lasting for a period of two week, up to eight months. And unfortunately, that's not including the months I've spent shacked up on the couches/spare rooms of my friends. 

I've lived outside, completely alone in the remote woods for 4-5 months. That wasn't so bad with a huge tent. Florida in the winter is great for tent life, but spring and summer is killer with the heat and bugs..The sherif found me, so I moved to a less remote spot and had gear stolen (thats haooened a few times)

Spent another month, sneaking onto the fly bridge of a huge yacht, downtown. I'd wait until about midnight and hop on board. I thought it was safe to stash by bag there for the night, but when I came back everything was gone, so that ended my stay.

Spent a lot of time crashing bathrooms and pool recliners at beach resorts (they're abundant around here and easy to sneak into, if you look presentable) I've been caught and ""escorted off the property "" multiple times, so this isn't recommended.

Most of the time has been spent in shelters, besides being treated like garbage by the staff and dealing with the general drama, that's been okay. Kept me safe and clean. Sometimes,  they've been so dirty and bed-bug polluted I've refused to stay for more than a night and once I was eaten alive for months awaiting housing.

I'm 24 now, my folks passed away. I dont have any family, and most of my friends are gone. I'm not a drug addict or an alcoholic. I work and make as much as I can. 

Fortunately I've been able to keep a roof over my head for the past 5 months. Up until yesterday I was paying $250/week for an awful motel room. Now I'm paying $400/week for a slightly better room down the street. 

If I had money for a deposit, $1600/month would get me into a high rise condo downtown,  or a 3 bedroom house in a nice area..but instead all it gets me is an outdated room in the ""hood""

I can just feel the homelessness coming! I'm so afraid to get comfortable anywhere because I always end up losing everything and being back to the curb. The anxiety and depression is crippling and I can't even form a thought sometimes.

All of my time and energy goes to worrying about keeping a place to live, I can't sleep or eat half the time I'm so worried about where I'll be tomorrow or the next day and I'm so scared of being homeless again. I have a pet cat now and if I'm on the street it'll be really hard with him.

I actually just got off a 1hr+ call where I was told to call again by a representative to be forwarded to a script. I dont have another day off until after the 15th cutoff date.

I need resources to contact the IRS in a more traditional measure. Person on the other end of an email or phone that can help with a problem that is off-script for the call center answering their phone lines lately. 

I have filed the 2019 return, well before the Nov-2020 cutoff. I have recieved the successfully filed confirmation email. I have checked all possible errors on the filing information for bank account information. I pay taxes, work, filed for the missing stimulus, qualify for both stimulus, filed the returns, recieved all possible confirmation from the irs 'wheres my stimulus' page. Status not available since last may. I have not recieved either stimulus. I have gone to the irs offices, they're closed. I need some help navigating this bullshit I literally do not have time for it, all time I have invested into solving this has felt completely wasted. It is bordering on sunken cost at this point. I shouldnt have to tell you guys who work full time jobs on top of the full time job that is being homeless that I literally am out of time for this shit. I have one day to do things during standard business hours and it seems I've just ran out of them.

I'm homeless. I work full time. I pay taxes. Why does the irs do this? 

I'm going to stop paying taxes. I never got my Obama stimulus either. I've never gotten a good return. Fuck it. Come after me irs. I dont have shit to take anyways.

If anyone has some info that can help me out that isnt contact the 1040# or irs.gov website let me know. I am confident I have exhausted every clickable option on their website and have contacted and exhausted the 1040# option 7(stimulus people) options as well as the contact the 1040# line ask for personal tax questions (pressing option 2,4 dont enter ssn, additional info x2 aka the 'how to contact person irs google query').

kv4gr3,"I find it hilarious how the friends who talk badly about the homeless also don’t respect your autonomy when you’re homeless. And then want to act like you’re unreasonable for wanting them to respect your privacy and space. Here I am: Come from a modest background. No drugs. No drinking. Actually pretty okay with my life, minus not having a job.

One of my privileged friends talks so badly about the homeless. For the longest time, I would just listen without revealing I was homeless. The things she would say were so hateful and ignorant. I find it ironic, considering many rich people who benefit from having wealthy parents and/or an inheritance will have destructive habits like drug and alcohol use, like she does, except they have a cushion and safety net for their behavior.

Anyway, she grew increasingly angry at me for turning down her persistent requests to hang out (a red flag, by the way). I finally told her I was in a bad living situation, and then her behavior shifted to demanding a text message and status report every day with my location, as well as disclosing where I usually sleep.

No thanks.

First of all, it’s safer for me to *not* share those details. Secondly, that’s controlling behavior, and I’m not a fan.

Anyway, I confided in another friend where I would usually stay. And as people love gossip, word quickly spread, and people started showing up to my car, leaving things, and expecting me to open my window coverings and wave to them like a zoo animal.

No thanks.

I knew getting angry and expressing my displeasure would only reinforce the ignorant narratives these people tell themselves (“He got angry! He must have mental health issues like all homeless people”) about homeless people. So I just reduced contact with them.

I guess I did so too abruptly, because they called me out on it. Again, I knew being honest would lead to bad outcomes, so I gently avoided their questions.

Since then, we haven’t talked. It has been about a couple months.

They probably feel good about themselves, dropping random stuff they think I need on my car. Of course, they couldn’t be bothered to actually *ask* what I need: a good job. They just want to provide what makes them feel good about themselves. Mission accomplished, I guess. And now I guess we’re not friends for the time being.

Dudes don't even have respect for ya, if you're flying a sign trying to make a few bucks, they will sit down and fly thier own like 25 feet away. Like dude, give some space and wait your turn. One guy pissed me off though I didn't show it. he was looking for Snipes on the ground so I went to offer him a cigarette. I kept my cigarette because he ended up buying a pack. But what pissed me off was he said that he had already eat twice today and might eat a third time. And then he went back to sit and fly sign for more. While I hadn't eaten all yet. Finally about 4:00 p.m. he decides to wander off, and I go and try my hand. I make three bucks in 2 hours. Enough for a sandwich at Walmart but that's about it. But American wastefulness saves the day. I waited till 10:30, after the mini mall closed, which is next to Walmart. Then raided the dumpster. Little Caesars dumpster specifically. Walked away with three hot pizzas they threw away at the end of the day. 

So tip for people who are hungry, if you didn't know Little Caesars Cooks pizzas ahead of time. So if there's one nearby check their dumpster about 30 minutes or so after they close. It's hit an miss, as staff take pizzas home with them too, but if there's pizza left they get tossed.

kov1l0,"1 month homeless. What I've found to make the day to day easier with 'hacks'. 1.) First and foremost, having a storage unit has been invaluable. Even with me not panhandling just hanging out near gas stations and grocery stores to charge my phone, and mind my own business, attracts enough 1-2 dollar donations to pay for the unit. 
2.) Having cheap or free phone service is worth more than the service itself. Many gas stations and fast food venues have promotional offers for cheap or free food (creating multiple google accounts multiplies the offers). Text in offers, such as the free coffee deal at circle K, are useful especially with a text app where you can delete your number and have the offer constantly accessable with each new number you get in its place.
3.) Older and slightly worn out (but mostly clean) clothes attract more charitable people than either nice clothes or dirty, torn up garb.
4.) Being helpful, polite, and straight forward goes miles in terms of people helping you and keeping police from constantly harassing you.
5.) Seeking out a church (even if non-christan such as myself) to associate with usually comes with helpful and resourceful church goers and pastors. 
6.) A drawing pad and a book are wonderful sources of entertainment and great time passing activities.
7.) Drugs and homelessness are mostly a combination to avoid. (Duh)
8.) Hydration prevents quickly recurrent hunger. Vitamins/minerals prevent cravings of sweets, greasy food, meat, salt and dairy. Both provide superior energy, focus, sense of well being, improved appearance (skin, hair, acne, wound infections,
9.) Oregano Oil, Tea Tree Oil, hydrogen peroxide, and a small bottle of colloidal silver have been invaluable medicines for almost any sort of infection,/ailment.
10.) Black Soap. If you're going to carry your own soap due to location and convenience definitely give this a try. Its a traditional and natural African soap that generally has few ingredients minus some with ess. oils for fragrance. It works amazing as either hand/face/body soap and works awesome as shampoo and really gets the dirt/grease out of hair. 
11.) Not an option for all obviously. But my Red Wing brand original style boots with gore tex lining have been the biggest blessing. I can be comfortably on foot all day, feet stay dry and warm when cold and not sweaty when hot. My last pair survived 8 years of beatings via landscaping and carpentry, with the worse damage being the sole losing about 3/4 of the tread, before they were stolen.",rude1rude9rude,99,2,12,1488

I'm not sure is this is common knowledge, but if you  aren't able to wash your clothes in a normal fashion, or don't have the time, you can hang them out where they will get sun all day, while you are free to do whatever else. Retrieve them that evening, before dew hits them if you don't want them wet; if they get wet they'll  start to smell again anyway like clothes you took out of the dryer too soon do after a few days. This won't get rid of any sort or stains of course, but smells are caused by bacteria, and the sun kills it. By evening your clothes will be smelling fresh. So if you have a shirt that isn't very dirty, but reaks of sweat, this will fix it. Turning them inside out b4 you hang them will help prevent fading too.

We also are looking at 30-40+ MILLION evictions as a result of the economic lockdown.

The average life expectancy of a housed adult in America is 78 years.. So divide 525 mil by 78 and you get 6,730,769 ENTIRE LIFETIMES (from birth to 78 years) lost..

PLEASE READ; (not an ad, not fraud, just help+money for once) Ok so I have been homeless for pretty much the entire pandemic, and filed for the pandemic assistance in March.

They want to give you this money, they aren’t bad people who get into this kind of work cause it’s not easy at all from the sound of it thanks to all the red tape from the Reagan ‘welfare queen’ ‘fuck the poor’ era.

kcnshl,"Homeless camping in woods behind house - advice? Hey guys - so there's a small wooded area right behind my house. Not super deep, maybe 2 house lots in size, with a road behind it. About a month ago I spotted a tent probably 10 yards from my fence go up. At first it felt a bit weird (actually at first it gave me a heart attack because I just saw flashlights in the woods at 3am), but honestly once I got past the weirdness of it they haven't been any different than the rest of my neighbors.


A couple weeks ago it got really cold. I saw them moving around in their tent, and called out asking if they had warm enough clothes. They gave kind of a rushed ""yeah we're good, merry christmas"" followed by ""who's that"". I told them I was the guy living in the house and just wanted to make sure they were OK because it had suddenly gotten cold. They gave a quick ""yeah we're good thanks"" and that has been the extent of our interactions.


I couldn't tell if they legitimately didn't want to talk much, or were worried that if they were discovered they'd be kicked out, or were just surprised. Any advice on things that would help you out if you were in their position? Should I try to offer them help again? I come from a rough background so understand the bad times that people go through, want to do what I can for my neighbors, but if it's legitimately best to just leave them alone then I'm good with just giving them their space (after all, I'd hate for a 'nosy neighbor' to be constantly checking up on me, if that's what I'd come across as).

I'm not joking, nor fishing for attention. Honestly, I'm just ranting. 

I'm scared to use a lot of the resources that people assume all this time and tax money go I to, because they never help people like me. 

I am ALWAYS passed over.

They flat out tell me, ""We only help x type of homeless person.""
Uh, okay??! Isn't that ILLEGAL? Am I somehow less cold, or in danger?

Being female, I am in *more* danger from wandering, rowdy men.
I am afraid to use some bathrooms, because they find their way in anyway. After a lifetime of abuse from MEN, I NEED A SAFE  SPACE FROM PENISES SOMETIMES!!! 

Thanks!!! Just for a while. I've met some wonderful men, and I want them to stay safe, too. But can I just have a bathroom and shower?! Don't they need their own space, too? 

Today, someone handed me a large printout of resources for the homeless, to include housing resources. 

I was lead on a wild goose chase, looking up potential places that might just, somehow, by some miracle, offer me four walls to stay in. Maybe even an apartment. 
There are always such promises. 
And it's the same thing, every time. 

They're full, no waiting list, especially because of COVID. I don't qualify. 

I saw a beautiful villa. It looked like a real home, a real community.
They were letting people stay THERE?! 

And then I saw it. 

""We don't help people like YOU. This is for the PRIVELEGED class of people that we selected.""

How do you think that felt? 

I've never treated anyone like this before, because it's honestly never occurred to me to. 
People tell me I deserve to feel bad for existing. 

I don't, to be honest. The whole world is upside down to me, including all this. 

Even so, every day, I'm told that I matter less than everyone else does. I'm a ""biggot"" for having different morals, and a different way of life. 
Every day, people try and tell me I am wrong for having been born a white, straight Christian female.

I am mostly healthy, my life has been devoid of any addictions, and I have no children, so I am always passed over for housing.

There is no reward for virtue. If I were to get pregnant by some random dude, I'd be housed pretty quickly, actually. I would never do that, firstly, because the child doesn't deserve this; second, morality. 

If I were a prostitute, I'd have more money, and be eligible for several specialized programs. 
If I were a deviant of gender or sexual orientation, there are lots of resources exclusive to thay type I could get in on.
If I were addicted or an alcoholic, I would be eligible for several programs.

None of those would be ritzy, but you know, I'm just as cold as anyone. 
The reason that special programs for certain races exist is so they can skip the line, and they're all happy to do it. 
Everyone needs their own community. 

Where is the short line for white Christian women, enduring the trauma of watching their nation fall apart, while the world laughs at them? And tells them ""nothing is happening to you"", as only an abuser would?

I also know that it's 2020 and almost everyone doesn't use checks or even if they do people have credit/debit cards with it.

For those who don't understand how the scam works,

They send you a check and usually will ask you to send back a portion of it because they sent too much. After you send some back the check will bounce leaving you with a huge negative balance and without being able to pay it eventually the bank will press charges for check fraud and you will take the fall for it because the person who sent it doesn't exist.",hannahpenns,157,4,9,1231

So we have people coming in who need to get checked by the guards, people waiting in line for food stamp stuff, and people lining up behind both groups.

I can honestly say that wouldn't have worked out. Had ot not been for the button down dress shirt and presentable jeans i was wearing. A ""Professional"" outfit that i picked up from goodwill.

This subreddit has really given me a new perspective and I still had some things that I was curious about and couldn't find easily.  I know some of these sound not only ignorant but also inconsiderate.(then why ask) I prefer you thinking I'm a cunt, (because quite frankly I am) if it means you answer my question than the other way round. Burst my bubble.

1. Is there theft among the homeless?
2. How much education did you receive in your life?
3. how much does the family home and childhood factor into it?
4. In the Uk, in my hometown, the church has a very strong connection to the homeless and they help quite a few out of poverty, or so I'm told by my mother. Is this common?
5. Is there no support from other charities, not to just give you soup but get you out of poverty?
6. I imagine myself sometimes seeing homeless people with I-phones when walking? How is this possible that some homeless people are more homeless than others? 
7. what percentage of homeless people have criminal records? How many people become homeless because of their criminal record?
8. (I'm sorry) If every homeless person made a plan and really followed it. (take the psychology/mental game out of it. Assume you work and sleep without thinking of relapsing) What percentage of homeless people could make it out of poverty/(homelessness?)?
9. is the shortage of jobs or not getting accepted by employers the issue when trying to get a job? Would increasing the jobs available really do anything against homelessness figures?
10. how many homeless people are foreigners? Do people arrive in the UK and are forced to the streets?
11. What drugs to homeless people resort to most often and why?(I don't even know why I want to know this one?)
12. How much of homelessness is due to mental reasons( I don't mean mental conditions I mean anything psychological)?
13. How much did your upbringing result in you becoming homeless?
14. How do you cook food? Do you eat hot food? are you allowed to make fires? 
15. How easy is it to find shelter?
16. Why do I so rarely see homeless people that are female? Do people care less about men? Do female homeless people ever get picked up and..sort of go into relationships just to avoid being homeless? (these are theories and I'm expecting to be proven very wrong)
17. How much of being homeless has to do with self-control? Are you more prone to give in to your urges? is that a thing?

jsnaji,"To members of the community who are against housing the homeless, you aren't economical or realistic, you are cruel. I choose to make this post due to a conversation I had with another r/homeless user in a recent thread about housing the homeless.

No matter what was suggested, he seemed to shut it down. I explained how housing the homeless works in Canada, how the government has publicly stated that our program to put every homeless person into their own individual hotel room at current market cost (lower than normal but considerable still) has saved them more money than leaving them on the street would.

See, housing the homeless doesn't mean creating a burden on regular citizens. It really sounds like it should, but it doesn't. The user in question dismissed this idea because I am Canadian and he is american.

But this isn't a Canadian phenomenon. In America, Canada and many parts of Europe, it has been demonstrated that housing the homeless is not a net loss, that money is actually saved. This is due to the limited police interaction, emergency room visits, rates of sexual violence, theft, risk of lethal overdose and untreated physical or mental illness that becomes a problem in the future. 

He then dismissed that by saying that criminals will be criminals and some nonsense about the 'gubment' (his word).

It is cheaper here to pay for $100 a day hotel rooms for Canadians who apply (in provinces that actually followed through with the program) than it is to leave them on the streets. It is more humane to house the homeless than it is to leave them on the streets.

There is not an excuse to be against housing the homeless anymore. It isn't a political position, it isn't an economical decision, it is cruel and built upon the idea of ""I work for what I have why shouldn't they"" or ""why should I pay for them to kick back in a home they don't pay for"". 

Nobody is asking you to pay. We are trying to SAVE you money. Nobody is suggesting hotel rooms either. The fact that hotels are cheaper than doing nothing should demonstrate how much money we waste keeping the homeless homeless. Now imagine low-cost housing, built en mass, interspersed in communities across America that suffer from a homelessness crisis, that costs a lot less than $100 per person per day. If that doesn't float your boat, that's cool! But you should come up with an even better suggestion because doing nothing isn't the right answer.

A month ago 2 bitches from my school decided to make a false rape claim against me. The 3rd floor is closed due to corona or something, and they claimed that I told the one girl to meet her up there and il show her something. They then claimed that I was raping the girl in a room and the friend went to go help. I was on the 2nd floor at this time, but was in the bathroom for quite a while passing time because I had credits for my 2nd period. 

This the  led to me being ""suspended"" (more so expelled because I haven't been let back in like a month) all my friends except a couple have been shit to me, and my parents hate me. They didnt kick me out, but I knew I was hated there. I bet they were planning on kicking me out because they wouldn't talk to me or make me food or anything. It was like I wasn't even there. 

Last night I left. I knew it would better for me to leave, so I packed my clothes, my laptop, phone, powerbank, and about $1000 cash I had saved. I also (conveniently) packed a bugout bag a while back with cooking utensils, sleeping bag, bandages, and pretty much everything that would keep me going for a while. I packed 3 days worth of dehydrated food in the bag, so I have a pretty good start I think. I have a pretty big backpack, as it was a surplus military backpack. I haven't recieved any messages from nobody besides the ones from random people adding me on snapchat and sending me threats, and some messages from my close friends who knew I was in the bathroom at the time. Non from my parents, so it's obvious they aren't looking for me.

I hooked a ride from my small town of about 500 people and took it to lloydminister. I have a pretty warm jacket and decent enough clothes so it dosent look like I'm homeless, which is good. I'm currently behind a strip mall and have a vent that exhausts warm air. I'm planning on staying here for the night as there's no footsteps in the snow to indicate there's not much activity around here. 

My main concerns are shelter and an income. I would prefer to be in a hotel/rented room. However, without an address or permanent address it would be hard to get an income, so it would be hard to keep staying there. I have my ID, and I have my laptop and access to a printer. Should I create documents to make it look as if I have a permanent address in lloydminister? I have adobe photoshop on my laptop. 

I'm so fucking angry that I dont have a voice and those bitches ruined my life for no reason. I had everything going good for me, I even had a possible scholarship to a private school as I was excelling in all subjects. I would've had a great future, but no, some bitches had to fucjin ruin my fuckin life for no reason. I barely even knew those pieces of shit.

Im going to cut the shit, and get to my point. Ever since i left for college, i had always wondered what my purpose was. I always loved people, and thought of myself as a classical thinker, a kinetic learner, and a people person in general. After I had to leave college last dec., i spent a year wondering why i was so complacent and how something would never let me settle. As some background, i was an international relations and philosophy double major, minoring in Spanish. I had paid for all the schooling i got myself, but due to my aunt/uncle renouncing me for trying to become independent, i couldn’t continue. I threw around the idea of the military with a friend, and we got a place so we could prepare for it. Two months down the road he tells me he never cared, and that Things got so easy on me when my parents passed, and that everyone was right about me being a failure. I am out to prove my family and him wrong, and make my parents proud. What i can truly see myself doing for at least a few years, is getting a van and traveling the country to speak with people like ourselves, and learn about their stories, Give them some food, And make sure that everyone knows that they are loved, no matter your circumstance. Id live off doordashing, and honestly with this week i can say i have ‘transcended materialism’ which is why id be okay with a minimalist and free spirited lifestyle. If you guys have any questions, any comments, or hell if you’d like to give me some stops, comment your state and city, and ill be on my way out of va in a month or two. I look forward to learning from and meeting all of you, and remember, someone cares. I care. I just want to show that i care. My one request to any listener or reader is just to put a little more love into the world, in one where we are so divided over stupid, trivial things like the color of your skin or what gender you are.

jnm4ug,"Chronically homeless, need better survival skills Hi there, 21F here. I struggle with severe chronic mental illness that leaves me homeless over and over again, and even though I have a home now it's pretty inevitable that it happens again. I'm at peace with that for now but I've realized I have no skills to keep me safe by myself. When homeless I've nearly always relied on others for safety; I'm a young woman with aspergers, so on top of already being a possible target, my interpersonal knowledge is questionable and could be taken advantage of (I'm extremely cautious with strangers, but emotional manipulation is a weakness of mine). Up until now I've survived only because of shelters, other kind homeless people who would take me under their wing, and a GREAT amount of luck. I'm in a different country now though where there are no easily accessible shelters like before and the homeless folks are different, so I'm going to need to fend for myself, and that's a first time for me. I know how to set up camp and stay warm, I have the gear, but I never know where I would be safe inside of cities, especially now that I'm alone. I don't know how to read people as well as others. I am a woman, so I'm weak and small. I don't have any skills to panhandle or work day jobs. Last time I was homeless a friend took me hitchhiking, which is what I want to do again (if the coronacrisis ends) since staying in one place is not really an option here, but I am a liability and have no valuable skills whatsoever to make another homeless person/hitchhiker want to take me under their wing again, except being funny and kind and speaking 4 languages (I'm in Europe), but that's about it, and it's of no use if I need to be independent and take care of myself. I'm just... looking for some skills that I can learn now that I temporarily have a home so that when I inevitably end up homeless again, I will be in a less dire situation than I would be in now. Was wondering if anyone has any suggestions? Think skills to panhandle, work day/temp jobs (maybe learn to paint/fix sinks/farming or something else I could do wherever for a couple of days if the mental illness allows me), how to decide on a good hiding spot within big cities, things like sewing or other skills that could be useful. Stuff that doesn't take very long to learn because my mental illness doesn't allow me to commit to anything for more than a couple of weeks at most. How to know who's got bad intentions. I don't know. I just, I don't think I will be as lucky if I end up homeless again so I would appreciate any and all advice from you guys. Like really, anything will do.

As for therapy/medication, I've been medicated since kindergarten, tried 8+ different kinds of medication, and been in therapy for 7 years, inpatient twice. Seen so many therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists I lost count. For some people mental illness doesn't get better or if it does, only very, very slowly. I'm sure I will get there eventually but it's going to take many years, and in those years I will relapse, since that's just part of the package deal for me. So I'm looking to make those relapses as safe and non-traumatic as possible.

TL;DR: I'm chronically homeless, will be homeless again, am a young female and have no idea how to stay safe, make money, or have any other useful skills to get by all by myself, and I need to work on that now before it's too late. Would appreciate all advice. Sorry if I sound stupid, this is just the way things are for me right now. Thanks for reading.",Vivid_Asparagus_5280,8,1,12,1488

I usually kindly ignore homeless people to the best of my ability because I've been scammed a few times but I could tell that he was hungry. I read his sign and he wasn't even asking for money; he just wanted a meal. So I rolled down my window and asked him if he had eaten today. He shook his head so I told him to go to the Chick-Fil-A within a stones throw of his median and that I'd buy him a meal there. He sort of muttered ""Chick-Fil-A"" and I said ""Yeah, I gotya"" and I headed that way. The look on his face was utterly hunger. I had never seen hunger so clearly painted on someone's facial features as the way he looked. It wasn't that his face was drooping, it was that it had turned sour in a gaunt way. I've been having trouble eating in general because of my Crohn's disease, but what he had was something else. There was a certain dull hate in the expression on his face that caused me genuine concern for him.

I got out of my car so he could see me as he was walking up, didn't want him unsure as to whether or not he was going to eat. I was already drinking some Starbucks so I planned on going inside with him, talking with him while he ate and then getting him a meal to go but we found that the indoor dining area was closed because of Covid. So I just told him to hop in my car and we'd go through the drive-thru. When he got in the car I told him that I could tell that he was truly hungry from the look on his face. I had been homeless a few times myself but nothing like what he was likely going through. He was about 5'10'', muscular in build but his clothes were so ragged that I could tell he was in the middle of it. He was all tattoos and beard, with a rasp to his voice like he smoked a lot of cigarettes.

When he got in the car I instantly felt a bit of fear, thinking he might pull a knife on me or something but I remembered how I survived a suicide attempt last April where I sliced my own throat with a karambit knife and the thought calmed me. I bled a lot that night and still survived, so even if he had cut me open... I'd still be a tough customer. I asked him how long he had been homeless and he said that it had been since his wife died. She overdosed on heroin while they were trying to kick the habit with suboxone. The police were not very friendly to him when he happened upon her, sitting ""Indian style"", dead with a needle in her arm. He gave her two doses of NARCAN to no avail. I gave him my condolences, which was the best I could do. He showed me his needle tracts, proudly stating that he was kicking the habit. I got him two meals, one for now and one for later and a couple of drinks.

I asked him where I could drop him off and he told me back over at the gas station next to his median. Turns out that gas station was pretty friendly to him. They'd let him charge his phone, use their bathroom and chill outside to eat. As I was pulling up, I remarked to him that he needs to find some shelter by the time it starts to get cold this winter - that capitalism kills lots of people this way and that it is extremely underreported. When he was getting out, I remarked that I wish that I could do more for him - which he told me not to worry about. I had introduced myself by my first name, ""Angel"" but I usually go by my middle name, Julian. It occurred to me as he was getting out that I hadn't asked him his name when he first walked up so I asked him there when he was getting out of my car. He told me his name was ""Chris"". I told him that if I saw him again and could afford to, that I'd buy him another meal, to which he was gracious. I also told him not to give up as he set the last of his stuff on the curb. He told me that he'd never give up. I plan on returning to see Chris soon. Something about him smacked of a brighter future.

Moral of the story: Don't assume every homeless person is going to slash your throat if you let them into your car. If someone is just asking for food - not money - then their situation is desperate. Everyone has a story, and sometimes just articulating it to someone else shows them the next step on their journey.",MF_VIHCIT,125,1,9,1231
jkd85m,"It's not racism if evidence proves I'm right. So a man who happens to be black stole things out of my storage case at the shelter today. 

I told denver rescue mission that things were stolen from my storage case (never said a black guy stole it), and was immediately chastised for being a racist.

As is procedure, denver rescue mission looked over the security footage to determine who the thief was. Surprise surprise, not only was it a black guy, but it was the same black guy who's been kicked out a few times before, because he did the exact same thing.

Somehow, the man with the bachelors degree in private investigation (i.e. me) is still racist for coming to the conclusion that this individual who stole my things is a black guy, despite evidence to back up my claim. 

Its not racism if its fact. If it was a Hispanic guy, I'd have said hispanic, if it was a white guy, I'd have said white.

Hello all, long time ally of the homeless here, but not homeless myself (and never have been, just for the record).

Obviously I can't know everything about every situation, location, and complication.  But there are many wise and far more experienced people on this forum, especially when it comes to actually being homeless, so I would gladly defer to them if I can.

j9vj14,"What would an extra $60 a month mean for you? I've monitored this subreddit for a few years and I am surprised this has not been a topic.  I am not homeless anymore, but Covid keeps a return to the streets in the back of my mind all the time.  I find myself planning how to face it if that day comes again.  One of the things that would have helped in my previous homeless stints would have been the ability to scrape up even small amounts of money.  In 2020, it must be much harder.  $60 would have got me some combo of storage, gym membership, bus passes, hygiene items, phone bill, or even a luxury item or 2 to make life a little easier.  Well, if you get food stamps, this is a easy, LEGAL way to get extra cash AND keep your food.

The Ibotta app gives cash back on many items you already buy.  It is free.  The only downside is you need to plan your store trips in advance.  I remember having hours of boredom in the library, so this should not be a hurdle.  There are probably strategies to maximize your earnings.  This is mine.  Maybe there are better ones out there.

First, most major grocery stores have thier own app.  If you are close to one, get it.  If you live in a city and have the ability to shop several stores, get them all.  Download the Ibotta app.  Go through every item and add anything to you list that you might want or need and any items with a high cashback to price ratio.  For example, if you know something costs $2.49 and it has a cashback of $1.50, add it.  If you have a place to store food, a refrigerator, and ways to cook, everything is available to you.  You may not have that.  There are probably people that spend all thier foodstamps on granola bars and protein bars.  These items are always available for cashback.  If you list use the Ibotta app alone, you can make $40 or so a month and keep the food.  If you get the store app as well and cross reference for weekly local sales with Ibotta, you can double your cashback.  There are many examples of BOGO in the Ibotta app and then BOGO on the same item at the local store.  In these instances you are spending food stamp money to get 2 items which you will get all that back in cash through Ibotta.  You items become free and you get cash.  There are even rare cases when you make money because combining the sales gives you more than the cost of the food.

I have made about $120 in the past 2 months using only food stamps.  There are many other apps out there.  They may pay more or it may be possible to stack offers.  It all depends on the effort you want to put in.

Ok, sounds good.  Has to he a catch, right?  A small one, yes.  You need a paypal account to cash out.  If you have an address you can have one mailed free.  If not, you can get one for a couple dollars at walmart.  You need $20 in cashback to cash out.   Not really a problem.  $40 is easy to get with almost no effort.  Cash out is instant.  711 atms offer no fee paypal card withdrawals.

A couple things to keep in mind to get the most money.  Plan ahead.  If you find a great deal,  most reappear in the app a couple days later.  Look for more bonuses under earn more.  If you can plan a couple trips a week, you will make more.  Sometimes in the middle of the week, they throw out a $5 bonus that is easy to get.

I hope this helps someone,  I know it would have helped me a lot.  Keep pushing forward and hang in there everyone. 2020 won't last forever, it just feels that way.",nachoslave,3,1,9,1231

Details:

've written it down for a while but been not able to read it back:

We met online. I was doing the last semester of my first degree. He was on the edge of being broke, homeless and hopeless (he decided to kill himself when he gets too old and has lots of physical pain). As a friend, I suggested him that he should give a try in China. This was a suggestion based on his 15 years of living in Korea. He got married with a Korean and they had their own school there. He described his ex-wife as a workaholic, and a crazy and materialistic person. He said the business was great but they were burnt out so they closed the business and went to Canada to live. He said they spent too much time together and argued a lot so they divorced, He did not fight for anything as he knew she would do everything to get everything they made together. He went back to live with his mother who was in need of being taken cared of.

He went to Beijing in November, 2016. Due to a number of reasons, he did not like the city and job when he first came to the city where was far away from me. He then came to Shenzhen and had great difficulty of being employed due to his hearing problem and physical health conditions. We dealt with his visa problem for half a year (during January to May in 2017). Finally, we made it. Also as a non degree holder, he worked as an online teacher. The teaching hours however were not enough to support his living. After a period of hard time, he had been gradually rebuilding his life this year since June. Before that I had been offering lots of financial help. It was not asked by him at all.

In mid October I received his call and he told a bunch of police came to his place out of sudden. We lost contact very soon. I then contacted the local consulate. The next day they told me they were informed that he was in administrative detention as he did not hold the appropriate work permit. They also told me that the period of detention shall be within 15 to 30 days according to the law(s). Last Friday was his 30th day. The consulate sent some people to visit him to know more about the matter. They got informed by the local authorities that his investigation has been extended since they think his case is complicated.

I thought I could get an answer last Friday but it turned out to be very unexpected. It has been an ordeal for me for more than a month. I spent time on thinking about what else I could do to 'help' me and him. It took me lots of time to find out his mom's address in Canada as well as his ex-wife's information (contact number, e-mail and how she's doing generally). I did contact his mom on phone but did not contact his ex-wife as according to what I have known she's married to someone else in Canada and got her citizenship there. There is no point of contacting her though I was desperately looking for some possible help in any kind.

I finished my postgraduate programme in May this year. I had been taking several part-time jobs, including tutoring kids in a private center, at their home, and adults, and some other gigs.

In April I found I had more and more physical discomfort. In mid May I was sent to a hospital and diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. I tried the antidepressant given by the hospital for a week but got lots of severe side effects, including high frequency of panic attacks lasting for at least two to three hours. I stopped taking it in May. Gradually got a bit better in June, and better in July but in August I had a bad cough. My breathing difficulty appeared a lot more often in August. September is my birthday month and I thought I would be a lot better in Sept. when I first knew I had this issue in May. I inwardly set time for my recovery, which was very stupid. I got physically very ill in September and mentally collapsed. He had been affected by my health issues. He got so depressed. He went to drink very often during August to October. I was back to medication last month. I have been taking stabilizer and antidepressant. I have choking anxiety and an OCD of cough (esp. after eating and whenever I feel 'suffocated'). I have been seeing different therapists as well since July.

I deeply knew I should prioritize my physical and mental health first but I cannot help let the negativity of everything about him go.

Edited in 16 Nov, 2018 (the above)

After 35 days of being in a detention house he was released and requested to leave mainland China within 24 hours. He left Shenzhen in 24th October and went to Hong Kong to rest for a few days before taking a long-hour flight back to his home country.

I did not know anything about these until he told me. He told me for 35 days everyone in the detention house could be only allowed to stay in the house. Sometimes it was very crowed. Every day they could only sit on a bench after waking up. Everyone was only given a thin blanket to stay warm at night. There were only squat toilets with no walls or doors. The odor was lousy at the time. Only Chinese foods were given. There were many homosexuals, and it was often seen that some sexual moments under their blankets. Some even touched him, and it reminded him of a misery happened in his childhood. He was raped by his elder brother when he was little up to 15 years old. When staying there he always banged his forehead to the wall or bars to kill himself. He had no idea about when he would be released. He had a bad cold for a few weeks. He was always smacked by some light sleepers there when he got into deeper sleep and snored. He did not shower or brushed for 35 days, like everyone there.

After staying for a few days in Hong Kong, he took a flight back to Vancouver. The first week he held a positive attitude about bettering himself. However after the first week he has been very depressed. He has zero desire to talk to me. Even I sent him emails that contained information about mental health resources that he could try to get help from in his place, he has not replied me at all. I understand that he is now undergoing jail and rape traumas but I already helped him search information that he could seek help from. I do not understand why it would be that hard for him to make phone calls to those centers to book appointments. He also needs a physical health check but he has not asked his doctor (nurse practitioner) to arrange one for him. I asked him to call some other doctors who can receive new patients but he has not done that yet.

Since weed has been legalized throughout Canada, he has been taking weed for two week at least and drinks a lot to try to numb himself. I feel so disappointed as he promised me he would not do that when he was back to Vancouver.

He left me no choice but only said, 'concentrate on myself''. I am really feeling despondent.

Something more about myself:

I had breathing difficulty and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder since May. My OCD has been developing (and changing a bit from time to time). First I had choking anxiety so I ate very slowly and kept silent for the entire time of having a meal. Later I was afraid I did not consume adequate amount of calories and I might feel uncomfortable easily. I forced myself to eat something between meals. Now I cough after I eat something. Very often I cough to puke. I have kind of managed myself that I do not cough to vomit but I still cough a lot after eating. If I do not cough I feel so uncomfortable and anxious. Even I cough I do not feel a sense of instant relief but a bit ""better"".

iyl89y,"Housed lurkers with giving intentions: Most homeless people start doing drugs AFTER they become homeless to cope with the misery that comes with being unhoused. While I acknowledge that some people do become homeless after falling into the spiral of addiction, a lot of experience servicing the homeless community has led me to realize that a lot of them became addicts once they were on the streets. 

I see people posting about not wanting to give people on the streets cash because they'll use it for drugs and it really breaks my heart because it really doesn't address the root of the issue. 

First things first the person you're trying to help is an autonomous person with thoughts, preferences and desires. By giving them cash you're recognizing that they're human and can decide what they want and need on their own. Either choose to help them or don't but don't patronize them.

The drug use in the unhoused community is a coping tool. It's often used as self medication for an untreated mental disorder. A reflection of our inaccessible health system. It is also often a survival tool. I've spoken to a lot of people (women in particular) who started using methamphetamine to stay awake to avoid being robbed or raped at night, and then they use heroin to try to get some sleep during the day. 

When people do want to get clean, there are very very few beds to detox in, and not having heroin/alcohol can lead to deadly withdrawls if not medically supervised. Withdrawls on a hot sidewalk is hellishly deadly for a lot of people. That's not even considering living in a state with no public health safety net insurance where detox centers are just non - existant. 

And where government fails charity steps in right? No. A lot of the drug recovery treatment charities are a front for churches wanting to recruit members. There is a giant Christian charity near where I do my outreach that charges people per charity service they receive in the payment form of an hour of mass attendance. Do you want breakfast? You owe one hour of church attendance. Do you want lunch? You owe hour of church attendance. Do you want to attend Narcotics Anonymous? That will be one hour of church attendance. Mandatory all day Sunday mass attendance if you dare want to sleep in their shelters. They also have strict curfews and timed dispersals. It is impossible to take these ""charity"" services and hold down a job.  

This religious perspective to drug treatment turns people off. Especially younger people who tend to be non-religious. 

If you're really concerned about the people living on the streets using drugs, you should organize and lobby you're elected officials for:
 
Safe injection sites supervised by medical professionals with a direct line to treatment for those who want it + Narcan distribution + drug testing for fentanyl, dignified shelters, clean needle exchanges, safe parking lots for car dwellers, affordable public housing, a living minimum wage, LGBTQ+ acceptance, a robust jobs training program run by strong unions, a city budget that funds mental health counselors and social workers, and a robust free at the point of use universal mental health/medical system. Anything short of that will not even come close to addressing the issues unhoused people have.",whale_lover,155,1,12,1488

&#x200B;

TL;DR at the bottom  


I had been couch surfing until a friend's aunt insist i stay with her; guess she thought it'd be a short stay (and I did, too). Fast forward 3 weeks and I'm still here. She doesn't seem too happy about it. I haven't been asked to leave straight to my face yet, but it's been strongly implied that I need to move on. 

My car- which was my Plan B- broke down and needs an expensive repair. I can't couch surf without a vehicle cuz everyone I know lives all over Los Angles and Orange Counties in California. I've applied for emergency Section 8 and who knows when I'll hear from them. (I have a PO Box so I've got a mailing address.) The place I'm staying has banned my childrens' father from coming inside since he was abusive. His ego got hurt and now he's banned my children from coming here. I have class at times when I could have my children. So, no staying the night and whatnot. (I realize he's being unreasonable, he's trying to control me through my kids-pretty shitty.) There's no fear for their safety here.

On another note, I've been looking for housing I can afford. So I applied to my school's housing program, but I'm too old to utilize that resource. I've tried CL since I get a little bit from financial aid and it's all full of people who want the gfe (girlfriend experience) to a creepy level. I've tried to get housing from a shelters and I'm not getting anywhere with my social worker or the shelters. No one is calling/emailing me back. I've used 211 to find these resources. 

I'm getting to a point where I feel hopeless. I'm at a loss of resources. What else can I do?

ipwqai,"Street Homeless Tip I'm sure that many of you who have been street homeless know how easily it is to get hassled for having a few belongings on the street and how flimsy those wheeled shopping carts are unless you want to spend nearly $100 on one. 

Public places like libraries used to give me a really hard time because I had a cat and a backpack and sometimes a sleeping roll and little cooler with me. No matter how little I packed they would give me trouble because they could tell I was homeless from some of what I was carrying. I was always washed, neat, presentable but my possessions often gave me away. 

My solution was to change wheels. I picked up a $300 stroller for like $25 at a church thrift store. It had a diaoer bag on the handles, way better tires and a rain cover. 

Once I got that the roll would be stashed behind the seat and my cat's soft carrier and little snap lidded cat box would dissapear onto the stroller seat under the cover. 

My backpack and mini cooler would stow underneath and I would stow the rest in the diaper bag as needed. Put the rain cover down and nobody took too close a look at my stuff anymore. 

Most of the time people just assumed I had a baby with me and places that had formerly barred me from coming in with my shopping cart would let me stroll right in. 

What could they say?

My cat is a support animal and she was so well trained that people would seldom realize she was with me. She would actually sit in the carrier leashed,  top unzipped and be perfectly happy while I did my thing in the library. 

The one library I used had conference nooks where you could sit by yourself and the librarian was cool with cats and let me let her roam so long as she used her traveling box and behaved which she did. That lady was awesome. She even let me take a nap sitting once in a while and brought me cans for my cat. 

The stroller thing made for a much easier walk around and much less hassling from guards in stores and that. It also kept my stuff dry and a bit safer when I was rolling. I could lock stuff to the stroller and lock the stroller cover and lock the stroller to something and not risk losing my stuff as easily. Much easier than with the shopping cart. It was way sturdier and rolled way better than a shopping cart and ultimately turned out to be a lot more discreet too.",mtempissmith,91,1,12,1488

I haven't posted in a while, but have been reading everything on here and remain thankful for this sub and all your stories, observations and advice/suggestions. Earlier in the summer, I was really struggling with being stuck out in the heat, humidity, rain, sun and being eaten alive by mosquitoes. (The heat index here is going to be 109 today and we got 8 inches of rain yesterday). I was having a hard time finding any place to go inside, and couldn't get online anywhere either because of the libraries being closed. I had posted how bad it was, and a few people reached out to me with offers to help. I am truly grateful for that. One of those people sent me this link and told me that Panera Bread was running a promotion and that I could get free coffee.

[https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html?ref=COFFEE712624](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html?ref=COFFEE712624)

This has been a life-changing thing for me.  It solved a lot of those problems. It allows me not only to get unlimited FREE coffee, tea or iced coffee, but I have been able to sit inside, plug everything in, get charged-up, use the restroom, wash my hands, get online and stay for like 4 or 5 hours at a time. I sometimes go back later on or in the evening when different people are working because I don't want to ruin a good thing by over-staying or camping out all day.

The people who work at my local Panera have been really nice to me and I try really hard to not look homeless or cause any problems. Just sit quietly, drink, and get online. So if you sign-up, please don't cause your local employees any trouble or make a mess. Most of these people are not getting paid much and have to deal with wearing masks, asshole customers, and the whole Covid stress all day while they are at work.

I wanted to make sure that you guys knew about it because I think the sign-up period ends in the next couple of days. If you just go to the Panera website and sign up from there, the deal will end on this Monday, 9/7. But if you use the link I included, you get the deal until your renewal date in November. That is 2 months for free. After the free period ends, I am still going to keep it because it is only 30 cents a day - and once it is cold outside - if the libraries and other places are still closed, it will be worth that for me. I already have the extended deal but figured I would post the link I used here so that anyone else who is homeless could get it. Like I said, it has pretty much saved my life these last few weeks. I hope it helps some other people since I know there are Paneras pretty much everywhere.

NOTE: You need a credit card to sign up but you won't get charged if you cancel before your November renewal date. Read the terms and conditions on the website if you have any questions.

Stay safe.

ijnpky,"Homeless for 9 mos and counting. Here's what I learned I've been homeless since thanksgiving of last year and it's been horrible BUT I have learned a few things that have helped me. PLEASE NOTE: These may not work for everyone.

1. Switch your sleeping schedule. I started finding places to sleep during the day and I'm up at night. It's helped me stay relatively safe and people are often to consumed with their own day to bug you.

2. Start getting mental health help IMMEDIATELY. Even if you don't think you need it, you can get your name bumped up on many waiting lists by being a mental patient. I actually suffer from major depressive disorder so some days when I feel like I've had enough exposure or I feel unsafe I go to the crisis unit. If anything they'll give you food and calm place to sleep for a few days.

3. Pack light. Invest in a storage. Keep extra underwear and socks. Also invest in sunscreen! 

4. Trust no one. Camps are rarely safe for men and women alike and weirdos cruise through camps looking for people new to the streets to take advantage of. Women and female presenting peeps: be careful around OTHER women. Human  trafficking is skyrocketing rn and traffickers often use other women to pick up victims to make them feel safe. I promise you will be better off on your own

5. If you are able, get camping gear. Anything solar powered is going to be your best friend especially since everything is closed to pedestrians due to COVID.

6. Swallow your pride. This most likely will be the hardest thing at least it was for me. The first step to realizing your own strength is to first realize that you are human who now has to sleep outside. Don't be afraid to ask for help from wherever and whoever you deem safe.

7. Find joy where ever you can. Homelessness is bleak. Especially during a pandemic. If you have the funds, treat yourself at least once a day. 

8. Find a still body of water and try to camp near it. Try to stay away from anything with a current or anything you can't see the bottom of. Maybe go for a night swim if you feel up to it. Its great exercise and this is also a good place to shower and potty. Kinda gross but hey you gotta do what you gotta do.

9. Remember that this won't last for ever. You'll get through this. You'll be stronger than most and you'll have a million stories to tell. We all have a primal urge to survive and your gut is always with you. You WILL get through this.

this is just everything I can remeber off the top of my head. if anyone has any other tips or better tips please let me know because I'm still homeless lmao. blessings to everyone reading this ♡

if6der,Living in my car I have lived in my car for about a week and I honestly thought I would not be able to survive. I thought I would rush back into a very mentally and physical abusive home life but I was able to continue to live in my car. It took a while to get out of the sad phase of it but now I feel soo much better. I feel like my life is just glowing idk. I just feel good about me and happy. I actually do the things I say I am going to do in a day. It sucks I have not told any of my friends because I do not think they will agree with my new lifestyle but I just had to do this for me personally. I feel like now I can be the person I want to be without the burden of someone telling me I am nothing and I will never be nothing. I don’t even hear that little voice anymore. I am seriously filled with glee and I don’t think anyone will understand that except me. Which is obvious but I just wanted to share my homeless lifestyle with someone or whoever decides to read this lol. Also I’m 20 and a female for anyone wondering and don’t think they can not get away. You can and you will survive.,tia808,113,3,12,1488

ic6zme,"The goose On Sunday I received a free lunch and walked down to the Waterfront Park to eat. There are a bunch of Canadian geese I like to watch go about their lives.

I spotted a goose with plastic hanging out it's beak, so I slowly approached, trying not to startle him or her. It kept trying to munch on this plastic so I gave calm prompts to not eat that. The goose thought I was crazy, probably onlookers too, but I slowly followed this goose talking to it for a time until it coughed up an entire zip lock bag. I snatched it up quickly.

There was some bit of food the goose was trying to unsuccessfully get at and was thorough displeased I stole it's deadly prize. I located the rest of discarded trash, making further geese enemies and left them in peace to plot their revenge.

It was a moment of perspective for me. Had I not been there, which is all tied up in my homeless situation this goose may have died. It's been hard navigating this new life, but I love wildlife and to be able to help in any way has been very meaningful to me.

i7rkom,"Off The Streets Finally!! I came out here to Southern California from Florida after covid ruined my job prospects and finances back at the end of April. I had been living, hiding really, in the attic area of a detached garage of an empty house being renovated. It was an okay place, well venilated, had electricity, was hidden and out of sight, and a clean place to stay at. Most importantly, its free. 

I've been working alot lately, working 2 jobs. Waiting tables at one place, and walking around distrubting flyers for another guy. Between the two jobs, I've been making $800-900 a week, and have been able to save most of that for the past month or so. I've finally got about $4000 or so saved up, so yesterday, I rented a room. Its in a shared house with like 10 othet people, and I have to share a room, but shit, my rent is only $400 a month- probably the cheapest rent anyone is paying in LA!! I'll be moving my stuff in today. So ya, I am no longer homeless, after having lived rough for the last 3 months or so. 

I've had my ups and downs these past few months, probably more downs than ups. But life is getting itself on track, a little at a time. I managed to survive this shit, being homeless agaim, catching covid, sleeping surrounded by a hundred black widows. A man can be down and out, but if you bust your ass, work hard, grab opportunities that arise no matter how small those opportunities might be, and stay sober, one can make it out of this kind of life.

i2ku1d,"I'm a long term homeless rights organizer with an org that does direct outreach/aid to the homeless near Skid Row. Please stop giving newly homeless folks bad advice. If you're not homeless/ex-homeless and you're on here, chances are its because you care. Thank you for that. But one has to come to realize that hearing about homelessness second hand through media, crime blotter articles, and Facebook comment complaints about encampments has molded your mind to perceive homeless people and its solutions a certain way. Also if you've never lived in poverty, you also probably don't have an accurate view of the way the American ""social safety net"" works. Reality; It doesn't. 

My perspective comes from years of working with the unhoused community and getting to know a lot of them over the years. 

Just off the top of my head: 

I've seen people respond to folks seeking advice with ""Call the cops, they'll help you and get you the help you need."" which is just an absurdly privileged statement. A lot of cops treat homeless people like sub-human shit. They are often harmful and downright dangerous to the homeless. The LAPD was discovered to have a label for prositutes and homeless people found dead. ""NHI: No Humans Involved."" It's often the police that sweep them and take all of their property and destroy it, to get them to move along to where people don't have to look at them. They also don't care when they're victims of crime. We see how the police treat housed people, imagine being a part of a group of people who is looked down upon by all society and has literally zero resources to advocate for themselves.   

I see people here telling people to just get on Section 8. The waitlist in LA and San Fransisco is 15+ years or so. A lot of counties are so underfunded and overburdened by the amount of demand that they're not even taking new applications. A lot of the homeless are on those waiting lists right now. Nevermind that a ton of landlords flat out don't accept the subsidy as a form of payment. 

I've seen people posting that they do not believe in giving unhoused people money. You do realize that unhoused people need things other than an occasional restaurant meal right? Some have food allergies, some need shoes, some need medicine, some need tents and a blanket, or to spend money on a drink at Starbucks so that they can sit in the AC when it's 110 degrees, and yes- some have addictions with no access to treatment/detox (also of those that do drugs, most of them started doing drugs once on the street to deal with the horrors of homelessness). If you're selflessly looking for a way to give - give cash. 

500,000 people are homeless right now in the US, and that number is about to grow exponentially - through no personal fault of those people. This is a systemic problem. This is a problem in both Democratic and Republican states. There are a ton more examples I could give, but I would just really like to tell people that even though they mean well - reality often looks a lot different.",whale_lover,296,1,9,1231

hyvty1,"I got out of homelessness 2 years ago and I'm so grateful. Here's my story. What's yours? 10 years ago, my meth addiction got the best of me. My family gave up on me and I bounced between homeless shelters.

Almost 3 years ago, after trying to get clean over and over again, I did what NA tells you not to do and I ran away to a bigger city with a bigger homeless shelter and a recovery program. I never completed the recovery program, too much religion and not enough recovery. I got kicked out several times, but I kept my sobriety through it all.

2 summers ago, I again did what they told me I shouldn't do and I got a job while limping into my glow-in-the-dark (1 year NA keytag). It was just a temp job at the state fair, but as hard as it was and wow, was it hard, I persisted. 

Then since I was kicked out of the recovery program anyway, I started applying for other jobs. I thought I might end up working fast food, my dream job was Starbucks, but I applied for a job that I never thought I would get. A job that I had the experience for, but I couldn't explain the gap in my employment history. To my surprise, I glossed over the employment gaps, focused on my strengths, and I was hired. 

Before I knew it, I was working in a call center for a major company and I was surrounded by people with real world problems. It was so bizarre. Going to training during the day, and sleeping in a homeless shelter at night. I finally got that glow in the dark during training. 

Now almost 2 years later, I have an apartment, I have savings, I have relationships with my family, etc. Obviously I don't talk a lot about it to work people. I want to be normal, but a decade in homeless shelters affected me. I'm not quite back to who I once was, and I don't know they I will ever be, but I'm grateful for the experiences that I had. They shaped who I am today for better or worse, and I for the first time ever, I like who I am.

I am soaking, dripping wet 24 hours a day.  I get nauseous if I try to eat anything and the calories just make me hotter, so I am starving myself trying to keep that from happening. If I try to stay in the shade to stay cool, I just get eaten alive my thousands of mosquitoes, so I try to keep my whole body covered - but that doesn't work either. I have my whole lower half wrapped in a sheet,  but the only long-sleeve shirt I have is a flannel thing that I only wear in the winter. I am getting weaker and more dizzy and light-headed and I have searched for some alternative to the LIBRARIES and COMMUNITY CENTERS that have kept this from being a problem in past summers - but they are all closed and as far as I can tell, no place in Raleigh, or NC has opened any COOLING CENTERS for this heatwave like they had previously done. I found this article when searching, and it had this quote:

 \[Weather like this disproportionally affects the vulnerable: people without the means to buy an air conditioner or crank it up to full blast. Many cities have typically had cooling centers, where people can get out of the heat, often in places like community recreation centers. The coronavirus has introduced complications, Lara said, because the city’s cooling centers now require visitors to maintain social distancing and to wear masks. “You don’t want to cram 30 people into a room and call it a cooling center,” he said.

In Maricopa County, Arizona, county spokesman Ron Coleman said the county has added to its collection of daytime cooling stations and land set aside for homeless people to pitch tents where they can have access to hand washing stations and portable toilets. The county has also opened a temporary overnight cooling shelter, and for those who appear to be at high risk for the coronavirus or who may have been exposed, the county has more than 200 hotel rooms “so we can have those individuals out of the heat and away from the congregate living,” he said. \]

In our last installment we discussed all the ways you could possibly get out of homelessness by using/manipulating- er, I mean utilizing your human resources like your girlfriend or her parents but now we face a different issue: You got a kid and you know what that means: instead of taking steps in real life to handle a situation that is ultimately in your hands to solve, we're gonna turn to anonymous strangers on the internet for advice instead of trying to get a grasp on this very real and scary situation! Before we get into it though, let's just take a moment to thank god that your kid is likely totally unaware that you've left their fate up to the advice you receive from an internet forum as that fact would likely scare them more than the actual reality of their situation!

So here you are, no-shit on the street with another human life utterly dependent on you! Whats the first thing we should do in this scenario? Should we immediately seek a shelter? Should we try to contact a church so they can provide assistance in getting the child under a roof and fed as soon as possible? Should you **be a fucking man** **and take control of the situation for the sake of your child?** Should you do LITERALLY ANYTHING besides take a selfie and make a post on reddit about you being homeless and subjecting your child to this horror? HELL NAH! We finnah take selfies and post em on reddit, so here's how to take the best selfie for the homeless subreddit!

Step one: Smile! Sure you may be in literally the worst possible situation a parent can be in and you should be panicking and scrambling to try and provide for the welfare of that tiny human life you've created but hey, you can't let that bring you down. By smiling in our reddit selfie, we can show the world that despite your failure to take appropriate measures in getting your kid the hell out of that situation as soon as possible, you're still keeping your chin up!

&#x200B;

Step two: Get the kid and her mom in the selfie! Sure, while we may not be asking outright for financial assistance in our actual homeless selfie reddit post, including the kid in the picture might illicit just the right amount of sympathy to get TONS of people to message you offering to give you money! Think of all the righteous bucks you can make if you make it seem like you desperately need money for a disenfranchised child without actually outright asking for it! Damn, you're smart! Sure, some people might call taking a picture of a child who's living on the street outright shameful and **downright exploitative** but who cares what those HATERS think? Only God can judge you, yo! The internet was there for you when you needed tips on how to make the best home made bong, when you wanted to jack off to anime cat girls and now they're gonna be there to help you recover from your failure to provide a decent life for your child! Hey, thanks for the gold kind stranger! Bless up!

&#x200B;

It's as simple as that! Being homeless with a kid is one of the worst situations you can find yourself in but as you can see from my handy guide, the best way to help that child isn't to get your ass off the phone/computer and go as quickly as you can to a safe place that will offer you and your family assistance but to take a selfie of you smiling broadly, with your girlfriend and child playing on the side of the road in the frame and then spend hours replying to strangers on the internet about all the ways you could hypothetically be improving your situation without actually doing anything! *Adulting is haaaard!*",Big_OG_Homeless,0,1,12,1488

Here is an online tool to help you find a clinic near you. DM me if you have questions.[https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)",corporalbrew,129,1,9,1231

he1k68,"Wilderness backpacker with nearly 25 years of experience here. Just looking to help out with my knowledge of camping, nature, survival, etc. AMA. Hello all, not homeless and never have been, but want to help out. In the past I have reached out to people looking for help on reddit with my knowledge from my hobby, and I've also reached out to a few other communities here to see if anyone would want to learn more or pick my brain on the subject of backpacking.  And I've been able to help a few people and it has encouraged me to keep it going. It only occurred to me today to come to this sub and that maybe my know-how could help out here. And just in case anyone might think I have any hidden agenda, like I am just looking for clicks on my blog or views on my Youtube channel or whatever, know that this is not the case. While I do have a blog and Youtube channel devoted to backpacking, and might link to them to help answer questions or comments, neither one have ads and I literally make no money on them--and they are not very popular anyhow. 

Let me try and get some basics out of the way that people who have little to no experience sleeping outside ask me about for those of you that are perhaps close to being homeless, maybe living your car and want more space, etc. Some backpacking skills apply no matter where you're sleeping, be it in the city, suburbs, or out in the woods. So I'll try and stick to those general good pieces of advice that apply pretty much anytime you sleep outside (with some exceptions of course).

Staying warm. If you are having trouble staying warm while sleeping at night, you not only need more insulation, but the right kind of insulation. Read the tags on your clothing to figure out what kind of fabric it is, for example. Avoid cotton. Cotton is not good at keeping you warm.  Just trust me and the majority of experienced backpackers on this: cotton in general sucks when you're out roughing it (with some exceptions like tropical weather). Wear polyester, nylon, and wool clothing--or down feather insulation if you can get it (but down is usually expensive). Also, having multiple layers traps heat better than say one or two (even if they are thicker than several thin layers). For example, when I sit around camp at say 32F/0C to be warm I'd wear: base layers (polyester or wool), polyester or nylon shirt and pants, a thin polyester hoody, a synthetic insulated jacket, and a polyester wind jacket as my shell layer (plus a rain poncho or jacket and rain pants if needed--Frogg Toggs are cheap and not bad). If you don't have any try and scrape some dough together to buy some decent layers at a 2nd hand store.  

2nd hand stores like Goodwill and such will also sometimes have sleeping bags and blankets. Again, read the labels of the bags or blankets you have or are looking to buy. Some cheap-o bags have cotton liners on the inside or even in the insulation. You also want to make sure to sleep on top of some kind of insulation. Foam sleeping mats are cheap, you can get one at Walmart for like 10 bucks, and you can sleep on more than one to be warmer and more comfy.  You can also use improvised insulation like a few garbage bags stuffed full of leaves, moss, grass, cardboard, etc. But a lot of body heat is lost to the ground you sleep on, so get as much as you can under you. And also remember that cold air sinks, so try and avoid sleeping down low and especially close to bodies of water if you want to be warmer.

Cooking outside. You can make your own stove to cook meals that are really cheap. Search for videos on Youtube on how to make an alcohol (the ""cat can stove"" is a good one) or wood stove (also called ""hobo stove"") yourself. You can make them out of recycled cans, like say a can of beans. They are fairly easy to make and you don't need that many tools or the tools can be improvised. You can buy alcohol (denatured alcohol, not rubbing alcohol) for fuel for fairly cheap at hardware stores or at gas stations/car stores (for example: bottles of Heet). Or you can get fuel free for a wood stove, and I've even cooked meals on wood stoves using only balls of newspaper (but it's not ideal, of course). 

Get a metal pot and spoon then do another Youtube search for backpacking recipes. A bag of lentils and a bag of rice can be cheaper than a meal at a fast food joint, and it's healthier and you'll get more meals out of them too. You can score free packs of condiments at fast food joints to help your meals, even if it's some salt and pepper packs it makes a big difference. A big bag of oatmeal will be many breakfasts for you, to take another good example, and you can score sugar packs easy. Some places even have honey and apple butter packs for free that you can mix into your oatmeal. And of course everyone knows about ramen noodles, and keep in mind that you can add lots of other stuff to them for more calories/nutrients (like: can of tuna or sardines, an egg, spoonful of peanut butter, etc.).

You don't need a tent. Obviously it can be a nice option, but you can also sleep under a tarp, which is a cheaper option that also has certain benefits (lighter, less bulky, flexible to use, etc.). You can buy a heavy-duty plastic tarp from a hardware store or online for cheap along with some nylon cord or paracord to pitch it. You can buy long nails at a hardware store to use as tent stakes and they will be cheaper and tougher (but heavier). You can even make a tarp out of plastic or Tyvek sheets that can be found in dumpsters or bought for cheap. But of course plastic sheets can get damaged easy and Tyvek is not 100% waterproof after it rains for a while. To help a DIY plastic or Tyvek tarp be tougher, more water proof, and also help you be slightly warmer, you can buy a space blanket (these are super cheap, like 5 bucks or so) and duct tape or glue it to the inside of the tarp. The space blanket will reflect some of your body heat back at you, or if you have a fire close to your shelter it will reflect a lot of that heat to you. If you're in the city and already sleeping in a tent, this can also help if it leaks, but in this case I'd tie and/or glue the space blanket on the outside and top of the tent.

If you are interested in a step-by-step guide to making a plastic tarp I can link to an article I wrote about it on my blog in the comments below. For solo camping a 7x9ft tarp is what I often use and it's plenty of space, but a 8x10ft tarp for one is huge for one and not bad for two. Search for videos on Youtube on how to pitch tarps if you are unfamiliar with how that works. The first few times might be tricky, but it's easy after that. You only need a few sticks or a few trees or one stick and one tree to pitch a good A-frame shelter. Or if you're in the city any two strong anchor points will do: street signs, lamp posts, benches, etc.

To keep bugs, mice, slugs, etc. off you while you sleep under a tarp there are also solutions. You can try and find a mosquito net or net tent or bivy, cheaper options do exist. You can even buy the cheapest of cheap tents knowing full well it ain't going to be very waterproof, but it should at least be bug proof and then you can pitch the tarp over it. Plenty of used tents and shelters to be found on reddit and facebook if you search around. Or you can get a head net for even cheaper and make sure to zip up your sleeping bag all the way. Helps if you wear a baseball cap to sleep to keep the net off your face.

Line your backpack with a garbage bag to keep everything inside dry if/when it rains.

Google campsites and/or nature reserves in your area to find places to camp, and also look into marked hiking trails close to where you're at.  If you don't have a car you can hitchhike there, but of course use common sense and be safe. You may also want to Google ""stealth camping"" and learn more about that.

hcagyf,"While trying to help my Fiancee's homless family with 2 teen kids get there living situation cleaned up and suitable for living. I got beat up and to top it off, CPS didn't help and calling the Authorities didn't help or do anything at all either.   Hi, I'm a 33 year old female that lives in Sothern California and I have been trying to help my Fiancee's homless mother, father and 2 kids, a 15 year old girl and a 17 year old boy find housing while they are currently living out of 2 filthy, hordered, trash, cockroach and other bug infested vans for about 5 years now. The reason they are homless is because they got kicked out of their last apartment for loud fighting all the time and the father was spending most there money on alcohol and prostitution. The whole family is in denial about the prostitution but my Fiancee has proof this is the case. His father also had a stroke last year so he is disabled and can't work as a mobal mechanic and kind of support his family anymore...  They are a Mexican family and the mother and father are illegal immigrants from Mexico. They have no pappers and will not get them. The mother has never worked and has some severe hoarding issues. (Like the stuff you see on tye tv show, ""Hoarders."" ) She does some nasty stuff and yes I believe it has to do with mental health issues but thats my opinion and I am not a doctor and I would never judge her for that I would love to see her get some help, the same with the dad and his issues...
 Anyway, my Fiancee has been living with me rent free on and off for 2 years then officially he has moved in with me still rent free for the last 2 years, so 4 years total he has been living with me. and we take his younger brother who's 17 now and sometimes his younger sister who's now 15,  in sometimes so they have a roof over their head, a shower and some homemade hot food on the weekends...And I don't ask for anything in return. I'm  just happy to help and when I am able to I will do anything to help my Fiancee or anyone in need.
 Besides trying to help them find housing, my Fiancee and I have been asking them for a year now to clean out the vans that they are living in and they just keep adding junk to them and not doing what we are asking of them when they don't have anything else to do... seriously... One of the vans belongs to my Fiancee that he lent them to SLEEP in so they have more space for all of them to SLEEP. But the mom just keeps adding more junk and food that goes bad to van and now there is no space to sleep. So they sleep sitting up. Both vans are cockroach infested and they keep spraying pesticide in the van so there are millions of dead and alive ones in the vans and food and the father keeps getting sick and has been going to the hospital frequenting after his stroke last year. Since I told them a while back I would call CPS if they didn't clean out the vans and they didn't so i did call CPS about 6 months ago and CPS didn't do shit. To this day my Fiancee's parents still haven't taken the threat seriously and last Saturday I put my foot down and spoke to them over the phone since they wont listen to my Fiancee, (their son,) or anyone at all and told them, "" look, if you don't clean out both vans and do what we ask as owners of the van I will call the authorities and have them take a look at your living situation and they can do what they need to do to get these kids safe.. And we will also be taking back the van we let them barrow if nothing is clean... "" So we gave them till last Sunday at 5pm. 
  As Sunday rolls around to 5pm we head over to where they always park the vans and they were still filthy and nasty with cockroaches everywhere and still in the food. My Fioncee and I were prepared to cockroache bomb the 2 vans right then and there to help them, if they had cleaned it all out. Well it wasn't clean at all. So I told them I was calling the Authorities to do their part because they have 2 underage teens living like this and we have been asking them for about a year now to get things clean. I only did this because I want the best for these kids. They don't deserve to live in these conditions especially when there is a deadly virus going around and homless people are more susceptible to getting the virus. Anyway, my Fiancee's other sister who is 21 (and has her own place and a very young daughter.) came to see what was going on and she just started beating me up there in front of a ton of people including her underage siblings because, ""It was none my business...."" (Idiot... the cops were already on their way before she beat me anddddd she has a young child... she could have gotten arrested and her child taken away for doing this to me.) I am 33 years old and I have not once in my whole life ever been in a physical fight and would never start a fight in general. I never associat myself with trashy people who think physical fighting is the answer.  I don't think she realizes I took her older brother (My Fioncee now,) in when he was homless 4 years ago and i take care of her teen brother on the weekends and sometimes her teen sister. And did I forget to mention, I got a bunch of cockroaches in my apartment from the younger brother coming to spend the night a while back and I know it was him because he admitted to my Fioncee he was the one who brought them in. So It is my business. These people made it my business when they started asking me take care of their teen children on the weekends.
  So, when the cops came about 15min after she let up off of beating me up and my face was all bloody but that wasn't what I cared about. I was more worried about these kids than my face so i didn't press charges when the cops asked me if I wanted to so they didn't  arrest her. That wasnt the reason I called the Authorities in the firat place so I'm  not going to let her beating me up distract me from what really needs to be done here. Now that the cops were there they looked in their vans and told me there is nothing they can do and it is not illegal to live that way.... WTF!!!! Someone tell me this is just wrong! Or should I have really just really minded my own business so I didn't have to get my face and body beat up? 
 OH, and yes we deffinatly took the van that we let them barrow away after all this and we are cleaning it ourselves and preparing to sell it. so now the mother that was so terrified to clean the vans because she didn't want to loose anything,  is now out of everything in the van we took back. All we can do now since they have nothing of ours anymore is just not have anything to do with them anymore, not lend them any more money or anything anymore, ignore the hate and just pray for them, that they will want to get help someday.

I would like your opinion on what I should do now or what not to do and should I have pressed charges against the 21 year old sister? Should I or is it too late?  I feel like now I should have because she made me loose my brand new engagment ring my Fiancee just got me while she was beating me up. Let me know what you think about all this.

I have a place in Belltown. Usually I rent out my extra bedrooms on airbnb but with Covid going on, all my reservations have been canceled and no one is booking right now. So two rooms are just sitting there, empty. 

I saw a person in Sculpture Park the other day who was bathing in the (freezing) water. We ended up chatting and I offered up my place for a hot shower and a bed for a night. She ended up staying a couple nights and then took a bus to Portland. It felt good, human, to help. I also see a guy bathing there on a regular basis but I've never had a chance to converse with him. I've thought about bringing him a better towel but felt it might be weird?

I don’t really have any furniture in the apartment yet until I go to my storage unit later. It’s kind of funny, in the tent we had a premium king size mattress that we found behind a swank hotel that was being renovated but our first night indoors we slept on blankets on the floor. We totally didn’t care, the A/C and lack of bugs made it feel luxurious!

I just finished a shopping spree at the dollar store getting tons of household essentials and cleaning supplies. I have OCD (the actual disorder) so I’m very excited to get back home and dismantle my kitchen cabinets and thoroughly clean them 😁 My housing worker was laughing at me because the first thing I got for the new place was a vacuum. I guess he was expecting me to get something more “fun” but I told him a vacuum was something I  could never have in a tent so getting one totally made me feel like I had arrived. 

Yesterday after we signed the lease I went to the apartment to drop off some things and plug in some chargers.

gw82nb,"Some helpful tips if you are about to be, or fear you might, be homeless. Yes this is a long post. Not TL;DRing it. Reading wont kill you. 

So I am a homeless person; more specifically a chronically homeless person. I've been living out of my vehicle for the past four years with two brief periods where I did have an apartment, but lost them due to job instability. After losing the second one, I have since resolved to focus on school so I can eventually get into a stable job and/or career, likely after Ive left my current city (was going to be like, right now that I was going to do so but COVID19 screwed that plan sideways).

But, in my time I've learned and experienced a lot, and contrary to what most would assume the experience was more beneficial to me than detrimental. I am, very literally not the same person I was before I slept in my truck for the first time and that is a wholly good thing. 

That being said, the most poignant thing I ever realized is that while no one can tell you what homelessness is like unless theyve been through it themselves, no one person can encapsulate the experience either. 

So take my advice with a grain of salt if you must. I will say upfront that my true #1 tip is to avoid being homeless at all costs, but given current and potential future events, I think its prudent to give people some way to put their minds at ease.

Tips:

1. Maintain some kind of income - it sounds counterintuitive, but having an income is the first priority you should have. Without an income, you'll be overly reliant on shelters and food banks, and ultimately I can tell you that even in nice cities these places *suck*. Unless you have no choice, I cannot ever recommend bothering with these places. It is not worth it. 

That being said, in the coming uncertain times, who knows how one might be able to maintain an income. Im personally running on scholarships and student loans at this time, though I hope to supplement it with an actual job soon, because duh. I have certain plans and Im going to need all the income I can get. 

 But you have to do something, because if nothing else it will keep you going and keep you focused. 

2. Prepare for the unending boredom. Most people will assume the hardest or scariest parts of being homeless is sleeping in public or even starving. But the reality is for most that the boredom is what will break you. 

Without the comfort of a typical home, it can be difficult to maintain the same level of stimulation one is used to, and this gets worse the less you actually have to do in a day. When you see homeless addicts, often times its the boredom that made them addicts, not the addiction that made them homeless. Thats not everyones story (again, no one person; I personally have never taken drugs and rarely drink), but it is a clear example of how bad it gets. 

As to how you combat boredom, the most crucial thing I think is having a modern smartphone. They can be relatively inexpensive to acquire, and if you have an income and can afford it, an unlimited data plan is going to be a massive comfort. Having said income can also potentially buy you access to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, etc. I personally also recommend Youtube Premium, as having an ad free Youtube is awesome plus you can actually have videos playing in your phones background, allowing you to multitask and use it for music without having to leave your screen on, draining precious power. 

Developing a hobby or multiple hobbies (I cook and still have a gaming computer from the before times; havent been able to use it much lately though) will also help, and if you decide to go to school or already are, putting extra effort into that will also help. 

3. Dealing with power. During lockdown, it was difficult for me to keep my phone turned on without wasting gas on driving around so I didnt drain my battery (you will kill your battery if you rely on it to charge your phone without driving around. Its fine in a pinch, but try not to use it too much without plenty of driving it accompany it). I ended up buying a fold up, 28 watt solar panel and a handheld battery bank. This combo worked, but you are at the mercy of the weather and it does force you to have the panel at least in full sunlight to get any appreciable amount of power out of it. Not always fun for me here in Florida. The battery bank itself is recommended however as it makes life a lot easier. 

But presumably we wont have to be on lockdown forever, or may be at least not again anyway. So, best way to charge your stuff is to rely on places where you can charge your stuff. In my area currently those are only really libraries, but in normal circumstances one can also rely on McDonalds and potentially other fast food places that keep their dining room open late or preferably 24/7. 

4. Dont be an asshole. This is good life advice in general, but if youre hanging out at a McDonalds or a library for the better part of the day, dont ruin it for yourself or others by being a dick. Always clean after yourself, dont bother other patrons or customers, and if you can dont pile up your crap all over an empty table. Ive seen people get kicked out, arrested, or worse all because of this stupid ass behavior. So, dont be an asshole. You ruin for others who may also rely on that library or McDs when you do that. 

5. Sleeping. First off, forget your instincts, dont sleep in a residential area. Karen *will* fuck you over the moment she sees your strange car parked on the curb. Likewise, dont pick a dark, vacant lot to sleep in either, as thats cop bait. 

Instead, find a large parking lot that hosts a 24/7 business. The obvious ones are McDonalds and Walmart, but you can also potentially try call centers, warehouses, etc. Anywhere with a lot of cars and a lot of people that come and go. 

And the same #4 rules apply. Dont be an asshole. Dont litter, dont bother people, and depending on the place, leave when you no longer need to be there.

Now obviously, not everyone is going to have a car. While I dont have a lot of tips for someone that doesn't, I can say that it is a case where you may want to lean on a shelter, but I have also seen people successfully keep a tent on them and sleep in the woods. I have heard horror stories about camping with other homeless people though, so unless you know and trust the people around you, Id try to stay isolated.

6. Hygeine. If you have an income, gyms are your friend. Not only can it help with the boredom aspect, but its a hot shower and a place to go if you just need somewhere safe to sit for a while or to get out of the heat/cold. 

If that isnt viable (or certain events preclude it as a possiblity) then you want to rely on bird baths and wipes. Bird baths are essentially a nice way of saying bathe using the bathroom sink. 

But again, dont be an asshole. Be quick as possible, *always* do it in the handicap stall, and for the love of god clean up any mess. For speed, it helps to just focus in problem areas (face, pits, crotch) and save anything else for when they need a serious cleaning.

In between these baths, rely on wipes. In camping sections at Walmart you can find these things called DudeWipes (or something similar) that work okay, but run out fast, smell weird, and fall apart. So Id recommend whatever the highest quality of baby wipes you can afford. 

And very importantly, dont neglect your mouth. A bag of floss sticks is inexpensive, and you dont even need a sink to brush. You'll thank me later when you arent writhing in pain at 3am in a walmart parking lot because you couldnt be bothered. 

7. Food. As noted, and as youll see if you poke around my profile, I cook. A lot. Its something I first did for myself about a year in, and it really does help you not only maintain a bit of sanity, but being able to cook for yourself is very forgiving to your wasteline. It does obviously require an income, and substantial funds to get started depending on how far you want to take it, but once its established its an effective way to go. 

If anyone wants a more indepth detailing of my set up, budget, etc lemme know and Ill write it out. It can potentially be as long as this post ends up being. 

But, presuming you cant or arent interested in doing these things, you do have other options besides the relatively expensive ordeal of just eating out all the time. 

Stowable dry goods like ramen cups, cans of soup, beans, etc are obvious choices and some gas stations (Circle Ks in my area) still offer public microwaves, so all you need is a bowl or tupperware. For canned stuff you can also just eat it cold if you have little option or just dont mind misery. 

Likewise on the misery side of things, peanut butter. For a small period I lived on nothing but spoonfuls of peanut butter. I cant recommend it, but it works. Get chunky, trust me. You can jazz that up by also getting bread, jelly, etc. 

On the less miserable side of things, raw produce. Something I did for a while was to essentially make my own chunky salsa by just cutting up vegetables and mixing together with whatever spices or condiments I had. The produce tends to be inexpensive and it isnt difficult to get even basic spices to make a nice salsa or pico de gallo. After nothing but peanut butter, the fresh produce tasted godly. 

8. Staying cool/staying warm. I live in Florida so we generally only have hot and very humid weather with a couple weeks to a month of below 50 weather. After four years, Im simply just used to Floridas heat and humidity, so keeping my windows cracked, staying hydrated and may be on a very hot night, having my little battery fan going to circulate air is all I need.

For cold however, you want to focus on heat retention. Layer up, and if you can try to acquire and pile on as many blankets and even towels and clothes as you can, and more importantly dont forget to layer under yourself as well. Wear a beanie or a hoodie with the hood up to keep heat on your head. 

If your A/C works (mine hasnt in years; i dont miss it tbh), try to limit it to quick blasts to heat up your vehicle. You dont want to wear out your A/C by using it all the time. 

And again, if you dont have a car, it may be time to lean on a shelter or look into camping options. You'll need a good spot if you want to build a fire, preferably on land youre allowed to camp on anyway. 

9. Stay connected. This ties into having a phone, but in general you dont want to lose sight of your ""place"" in society. Keep your vehicles tags updated as best yiu can, try to maintain insurance, and if you have a bank stay in good with them. My credit union has helped me out of jams a couple of times in my life and I always do my best to not let my auto loan be late with them. In doing so it can open you up to other avenues for help down the line. 

But this tip also applies to having an address. A PO Box is relatively inexpensive, and using a shelter as an address can work in a pinch, though I would lie to employers about it, and rely on email for any W2s or other communications you need from your employer. 

And naturally, dont neglect the people that know you. Not everybody has friends or family who might step in to help out (I dont lmao), but pushing them away isnt a good call.

10. Dont fall into the trap of selling stuff to stay afloat. It works in a pinch, but what really happens is that eventually you just run out of stuff. Pawn your valuables if you need quick cash, but dont just give them up if you can help it. 

Letting go of less necessary items can be a liberating experience for some, but essentially throwing too much away can leave you with nothing to really show for it. Money can easily disappear; stuff, not so much. 

Fun anecdote: falling into this trap is part of what put me in the situation that lead to me being homeless. 

And finally, for my last tip:

Always keep your eye on the future, dont give up, and always be planning for the day the nightmare ends. 

While I, as mentioned earlier, am taking a longer road to not being homeless than most would expect to be reasonable, it comes on the heels of rushing the process twice and having it bite me in the ass twice. What I learned was that, for my situation, the only thing holding me back is having a stable job that pays enough not just to occupy an apartment or rented room, but to actually live as well. 

In my situation, Im currently closer to r/vandweller than I am to r/homeless, so for me its a relatively easy choice after two heartbreaks to focus on setting myself up for success. Im finishing my 2 year degree this year, getting the hell out of this shitty area Im in, and hopefully Ill either be able to find a good job in my new area, or at least Ill be able to continue school until I can pursue my career, which is when I feel Ill be stable enough to bite the bullet again. 

But for you, that might not be the plan. With what might be on the horizon for all of us, it might not even be my plan. 

In my life, however, I have inexplicably developed a keen sense of perseverance. No matter how bad my life gets, or how bad I feel, I am somehow compelled to just keep going. To keep my eye on the prize, as they say. 

Finding such a sense in yourself is going to be the most valuable tip anyone can give, pending threat of homelessness not withstanding. 

---

And thats it. As said, take this all with a grain of salt, and for those that care to comment on my priorities, kindly stow it. My priorities are what they are because of how my life has been, and thats how it is for everyone. Theres little sense in judging anyone's priorities. It accomplishes nothing and you look like an asshole. 

And as tip 4 says, dont be an asshole.",gthaatar,103,1,9,1231
gvzyit,"Getting kicked out. Hi.  
My name is Rasmus. My entire life has revolved around what my parent think and their negative thoughts has always went towards me. I have 3 Brothers and they have been a challenge for them.  
Today my parents had a breakdown and said that I have until Monday to get out of the house or they will throw me out. I am at the breaking point of my dream that is becoming a pro gamer, I am in a tournament called Dr. Pepper challenge. In this tournament they decide 25 players that go to the next step and gaining 12 weeks of coaching by a polish coach. I reached that phase. I am one of the 25 contenders that they chose. We are 5 teams that will go up against eachother and the winner gets a sponsorship.  


I told my parents about this since they thought that the years i have spent figuring out what i want to study and do with my life have been useless and a waste of time. Their word were like a knife stabbing my heart, so close to my dream and so close to finishing it and they dont care.   
I have even signed up for studies after the summer and they said that they are throwing me out because I am ruining their life together. I have done everything in my power to make them realise that living at home by the age of 22 today is not that strange. I help with laundry, the dishes, walking the dog, paying for the food, helping my two younger brothers with their homework and I have even payed rent when they have asked me to.  
Their words to me after I explained all this were. ""We dont care, you dont do enough and your younger brother sees you as his idol, it is not okey that you sit by the computer playing because he will waste his entire life like you.""  


People that is reading this might not see it as such a big issue, I know this is in a thread about people with real problems and they should have a right to throw me out by the age of 22. I just dont know what to do with my life, I am so close to my dream and now they just make it go away. Maybe someone in this thread can help me in some way to get a plan, or a different mindset. I will jump between cities to stay with some different friends couple a days, but I have lost all my will power and I feel dead inside.  
I am forced to skip my studies for the semester i signed up for and I will have to get a job so i can get a place to stay for my own.   
But the issue for me is that I am losing my dream, my opportunity and all of the people I love in it.  
I love my parents and my entire life has revolved around not being a burden, about being a good enough son and making my dreams into reality.   


The truth is that they have never supported anything in my life, not my friends since they were gamers, but worst of all school. I did fine in school until I came home with a B in my worst subject and they complained that it was not a A.   
That ruined school for me, I stopped caring and I am fucked so to say. I hope everyone is safe with     Covid-19. Peace out.

As if having everything shut down because of the virus wasn't bad enough.....no libraries, no place to shower, no place to get inside, no electricity, no wifi, non-stop rain day and night for weeks.......I thought at least there wouldn't be any more bullshit piled on. Wrong. People decided it would be cool to start destroying things and as a result of that, now there is a curfew. When you haven't showered for 78 days, one thing that is really important is to try and stay out of the sun when it is 90 degrees all day. So I usually try to move around and get my food and other stuff after dark when it is cooler. Not anymore. Can't be outside from 8pm to 5am. Not only that, it isn't safe to be where I had been - thanks to the crowds, the protesters, the rioters..........and the police and national guard.

gum4o3,"Warning: If You Are Homeless Don't Do This! Don't sit up to sleep for days on end. Find a bench or someplace else you can get horizontal in. Drop in centers, trains, anywhere you have to sit up a lot can be VERY dangerous. Your body needs to lay flat at night to sleep so that your blood will circulate properly and not stress your heart. Sitting up for long periods of time with no lying down at night can cause blood clots, lots of them in your legs and chest. This is why respite beds are so important. In the street, in the train it's common for cops to hassle you to sit up but you must lay down or risk pulmonary issues. Speaking from personal experience here. I nearly DIED last year because I did this for too long not being able to sleep outside because of Winter weather. I'm better now but this is not something you want to risk. Trust me on this one. It can have lasting effects on your health. I have to take blood thinners. I use a walker now because my legs have issues still. No joke.",mtempissmith,174,1,9,1231

Me and my girlfriend are currently homeless. Been so for a few weeks. Earlier today I got to talk to another guy who was homeless who gave me a few tips about getting food. The best thing was that I could just fish in a lot of places around here for free. We went to a nice spot and I was just sitting there and literally watching fish jumping out of the water. Anyway I'm looking for advice on if there's any kind of organization that might be able to help us get maybe a fishing pole or maybe some survival gear like a tent or a few hammocks.

I woke to someone trying to yank my pack off of my head. I quickly jumped out of my sleeping bag and pulled my knife out. I turn around to see a man with a full face mask and goggles. A small Ninja sword in one hand and a can of bear/pepper spray in the other.

She has a job, but it just started a few days ago, so it could be weeks before her first paycheck.

Since then, we've talked a few times, and things only seem to have gotten worse. She says that all of the shelters she checked with are full and she has been sleeping outside and washing up at work, hoping nobody will notice.

I've given up on dating her, since she apparently has issues and is too busy dealing with them to even consider a relationship, but I'm becoming concerned for her well-being.

I’m in medical school, and I’ve grown to hate the field of medicine, I hate the culture of medicine, the competitiveness and the arrogance of my peers, I hate the subject of medicine, I hate the job of medicine, and I hate the thought of being a doctor.

I made a big mistake going to medical school. I like not working. I like doing nothing. If you put me in solitary confinement, I’d be happy. 

Is going into this career, a shitty one, a high stress one, really better than just being homeless? 

Here is what I am up against: 3 more years of medical school, 3 large board exams that demand a shit ton of time studying (and I’ve had it with studying! I don’t want to anymore!! The last 2 years being clinical rotations which will be brutal and there will be large exams every month. And then a 5 year residency working 80-100 hours per week in a stressful job.—I want NONE of it. I grunt at the thought of it, at the thought of studying and learning more tiny details.

I’d rather just quit it all, never work a day in my life and just sit on the streets in warm Miami, Venice or Hawaii beaches while getting food stamps. That’s all I need. I just want to lay down and do nothing.

I have been waiting for our state refund, him for over a month after the .gov state website confirmed that it has been sent and will take 5-7 business days. I’ve been waiting for three weeks past this confirmation. 

I brought the issue to multiple staff’s/caseworker’s attention and one of them told me “maybe the state didn’t really send it out like the website says they did.” 

The other one told me “it takes a couple of days for the people upstairs to sort through the mail.”

The thing is though, it’s already been 3 weeks past the 5-7 days and I have received mail from them that has a later date than my return should have on it. Meaning the have sorted through the mail already.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SlabCity/comments/gbqa5n/could_you_have_a_binishell_built_in_slab_city/

I'm set to inherit a house, but I have no ability to care for it properly. I do not have any real skills to do even simple things like shingle a roof or replace a window, and I won't have the savings to have it done. And I doubt that I can ever afford property taxes.

I want to become voluntarily ""homeless"", but I would like a permanent structure to do it in. Slab City looks like the choice for new- and I would like very much to make it my permanent home.

There are concrete shells you can have constructed. A simple binishell should cost under $6,500 to construct. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binishell

I will probably never be able to afford an RV, the but a concrete shell with a composting toilet should be doable. 

There sem to be four main challenges with my plan:

(A) Finding a construction company in the vicinity willing to take the project on

(B) Finding any kind of steady income in the vicinity - most people barter

(C) Learning to survive in temperatures which can reach up to 117 degrees in the summer.

(4) Learning to fit in

I will be roughing it, essentially, for the rest of my life - I will never be able to come home. But ""home"" sucks anyway. Better trying to live free than die under these conditions.",IndividualStatus3,3,1,9,1231

g92wle,"Bureaucracy Since the lockdown, I have been sleeping in this park that's elevated and mostly quiet. I'm very clean, no record, ""conscience""(in my Jordan Peterson voice), and cause zero problems. I'm very in tune with my body and  been experiencing some  respiratory problems , and I know I'm probably a carrier. So I've been coming back to this one spot to quarantine since they have yellow tape up and no people have attempted to come here up where I'm at for the most part. 



I think A Karen or Craig may have noticed and called security on me because you can't physically see me from the street, and he made a b-line to my exact location. Told me that the park is closed and there are ""better places I could sleep"". Yeah, no. There really isn't. This is the best spot because it shields me from rain, I can hear every step of someone coming up here who may want to add me to the missing persons database, you can't visibly see me unless you went out of you way, and there are not rats and bugs to deal with. 


I tell him that I am self quarantining and he asks me if I got tested, that it is ""absolutely free at this point"". It makes no difference whether I actually have it or not because there is no cure and you'd just tell me to go somewhere else, regardless. Although the park is supposedly closed, people come to the dog park here, loiter on the grass, and do workouts. But I didn't see him even  attempt to tell them to go back to their warm , million dollar condos they have waiting for them that they're 'bored' of. If I'm spreading disease, so are they. There are rocks and benches to sit on, trash and gate handles to touch(I've seen them and  their kids touch all of these things), etc.. So they really have no argument other than 'iTs tHe rUlEs!. It would be more prudent fir me to stay in this one spotthan wander all day spreading disease. I didn't say any of this to him because I don't want him purposely fucking with me, and ill be damned if I don't go back to my favorite spot. Fuck it. What are they going to do, sue me for my fuckin' 50$ snap check? Throw me in a cell with central air, three square meals a day, with entertainment? Please!


It's exhausting and it drains my willpower to the point where Im starting not to give a damn. You want to clog up the street on your 8th walk of your day at 8am? Fuck you, get this bug. And while some of you may die, that's a sacrifice that you are willing to make. Muhahahhahahah. Seriously, though, this shit is annoying and trying my patience.",HomelessFuck666,5,1,9,1231

g7dwy1,"Would it be rude of me to make a care package for a young woman who I believe to be homeless that I’ve seen multiple times? Hello. Please correct me if this is uncalled for, but I go to the same grocery store every couple of days for things and for the past week or so I’ve seen the same young woman sitting nearby and I believe she doesn’t have a place to go. She sits on a bench and has been wearing the same pair of socks, and she carries a large shopping bag with some clothing in it. The other day she was just sat there sobbing and my heart broke. I did not know what to say except for “Please be healthy and safe,” and she was very kind. Today I saw her again and it is cold and stormy out. Same socks. Bundles in a jacket. Not crying today. Just sitting, and I said hello to her and she smiled. I told her I was thinking of her and that I hope she is okay and safe today. I didn’t have any cash on me to give  She looks to be in her early 20’s like me and she isn’t asking for anything, but it doesn’t seem she’s moved in days, and I’ve said prayers for her multiple times because something about her has stood out to me. For all I know she could be fine and well, but I have a feeling she may not be. Would it be strange of me to give her a small care package? I don’t have much to give, and I’m not one of those to assume “She’s on drugs,” or whatever and have the audacity to choose her a meal or give her a limited gift card. It’s not my place to decide what anyone does with what I give them and I just want to help or show some compassion because it hurts to see someone who may be suffering. I was thinking of making a little package with $20 cash or so, again I’m in college and don’t have much money. An extra tube of toothpaste and toothbrush, a package of feminine products, some baby wipes, granola bars/some small bags of chips I have and some masks since I have masks for Coronavirus. Do you think this would come across as rude or presumptuous? I just don’t know how to help but I feel as if I must. I can not stop thinking about this young girl and her safety. Thank you for any advice or ways to make a care package for her.

Hey everyone. I took all of your advice and made her this package. Delivered it around noon - https://imgur.com/a/b7oKaf0

I put all the things in the backpack. Feminine products, toiletries, cash, hand warmers, meal bars and various snacks, a new towel. Honestly anything i thought may help. She was very apprehensive at first but accepted it very quietly. She told me she “has a place to go, sort of. It’s complicated” and i told her no worries. she does not to explain anything to me unless she wants to. I left feeling a bit weird but hopeful. 
After work my mom drove near there because its on the way home and said “Was the girl you gave your bag to black?” I said, “Yes. Why” She said, “I saw a young woman with your backpack. She had a drink and a little bag of food” and apparently was eating. It was definitely her because i had not told my mom any identifying characteristics of her, just let her know where i was going for safety. I am so happy she was able to buy a meal today.",makeupyourworld,90,1,9,1231

Then the governor, et. al. declared a shelter/safer at home policy to deter the spread within the community. I also thought with all the closures if libraries, coffee shops and, well almost everything else how does one survive while living on the street.

I've done 15 interviews from service providers to the homeless joint authority , journalists to researchers and they've all been great. 

But I'm missing the voices of people that are ACTUALLY going through this without a tenant residence.

Is there anyone, living homeless in los Angeles that would be willing to be filmed, filmed themselves, etc to talk about their own struggles?

g0zfll,"I can’t say fuck the police anymore It’s currently 12:54 at night. At around 9:30 I was woken up by 1 of 2 cops who have told me that I couldn’t sleep at a bench in a public park. Both of whom would just walk up to me with my small blanket wrapped around my upper body and my head down. I was told the usual, “we can’t have you sleeping here, you are trespassing, we don’t want to arrest you but we will if we have to” I took this as cops being cops, and them doing their jobs. They would walk away without a word and go on about their night. The 2nd cop (who I wasn’t expecting was different) before I continue, I would like to add that it’s been 3 days since I’ve eaten any real food except for a chicken nugget and around 6 cold fries I found in a abandoned happy meal, found out I couldn’t qualify for the stimulus package, and 1 of 2 of my charger cables broke. This man took 30 mins of his time (small amount I know but it means a lot to me) calling around 10 different shelters or locations trying to help me find somewhere to sleep and or better my situation. He came back to me and told me how none of the places he called were accepting due to COVID-19 (I wasn’t aware he was dialing numbers as I was fell back to asleep as soon as he got into his car) I was a bit shocked when he told me this, but he recommended a shelter for men for me near downtown that could possibly aid in my situation. Even letting me know that he wouldn’t mind giving me a ride tomorrow or the day after downtown to the shelter instead of walking there. He gave me their number and address and before he left, I asked him if he could spare some money. I wasn’t thinking he would give me any because the other 2 cops firmly denied me money. But this man without hesitation pulled his wallet out and gave me $6 without me saying much else! He told me to take care of myself and told me that he thought I was a really intelligent, and polite child and that the shelter wouldn’t have a reason not to help me out. As he left, I cried in my blanket trying to hold back the tears. I (much like what it seems like 70% of the world) suffer from depression and even worse PTSD. I’m only 20 and I’ve been going through a lot of emotions although I’ve only been on the streets officially homeless for a week and living in my car for 2 months. I have dreams and aspirations and they quickly faded away once my predicament got worse, I thought I would never have a family that I could call my own in the future, this man has sparked that ambitious and hopeful flame again. And for that, I won’t necessarily say that all cops are good. But after tonight, I’d be a hypocrite for saying fuck the police. Thank you for reading :)



EDIT: Hello everyone! I just wanted to say thank you so much for one, reading my post as I didn’t think I would get any sort of response back. And second, I want to say thank to everyone who have replied with kind words and prayers for my prosperity. When I was living in my car, I felt alone. I didn’t feel like I could possibly fight what I was fighting like others have for way longer than I have. But everyone who has replied to me or have helped me have a special place in my heart. I no longer feel alone. I feel like people want to see me win and succeed, and that’s exactly what I plan to do. If anyone wants, I can keep a update on my condition and situation if you all would like. I would like to keep contact with the people who are rooting for me during this really tough time. Thank you guys so much ❤️



UPDATE!: I have received another blessing everyone. Just today I got the opportunity to eat for the first time in multiple days thanks to the cop and Due to everyone being so eager to help me in this sort of situation. I’ve met many different cool people online in this platform. One of them being a new friend I made today, Andre. He was a pretty cool laidback guy who lives life wherever it may take him. He was in a unfortunate situation, and decided to live in his car willingly. He drove to my city from his which was around a 35 mins. And he gave me the option to select a wide assortment of camping gear, canned food and other useful items. A hour before Andre and I exchange numbers. A old coworker asks me to contact another old coworker. I contacted this woman, and it was at this moment, after spilling my story, admitting some of my downfalls, and explaining my situation, she offered me her trailer in her backyard. I was overjoyed, finally I was picked up by my coworkers and explained my my situation and showed how hurt they felt for me being in such a position. I made it to my old job (and when I mean old job, I mean the first restaurant I worked at, and not the one that fired me.) talked to my coworker about staying in the trailer, the rules, the expectations. She believes that I can change this whole matter around and better the situation as much as I do myself. I have now eaten my second meal since not being able to for 3 days and the food taste gets better and better. I’m working with my coworker on getting me hired at Jersey Mike’s, as well as trying to find a way to get me some ID. First we need to get me some proof of residence, but that won’t be hard. I took avery thorough shower. I wasn’t really embarrassed by how dirty I really was, wearing multiple layers in this Spring.....summer.....thing hahaha. It felt so nice to feel so clean. We all watched a little TV together and smoked a little weed together. I’m currently writing this in my current living space and it’s so damn nice. I’ll have to upload some pictures for you guys of them and the new space but holy cow. I must be luckiest person ever. I wish and hope my luck can shine on others that are in way worse positions. I’m very grateful for this opportunity, and I assure everyone that this chance that I’m being given won’t be for nothing. I promise.

fzxsx9,"So tired. Tomorrow will be 1 month since my last shower. I have sent about 50 emails to every possible person and organization here in Raleigh - each time asking about some program that there was a news article about that sounded like it would help. The answer is always no. Just yesterday there was this big headline in the local paper making it sound like all homeless people were being put up in hotels everywhere. Turns out - like most such news stories - that isn't true. Everything that at-first, sounds like it is great news.....always ends up being nothing. All that extra, extended, super-sized unemployment benefit stuff for the self-employed? Not eligible / not set up yet / need records / have to verify / don't meet the requirements, etc....The hotel rooms? Have to have kids, be released from a hospital, get tested positive and have proof, etc....And even when there is something that sounds like it \*might\* help, nobody ever answers, responds, or says they will forward it - and I never hear from them again. And now on top of everything else, this huge area of severe storms and tornadoes and hail is coming and is gonna last for like 24 hours. I also love how everyone has all these masks - except me. Can't find them, can't buy them, can't make them, can't wash them. And what maybe is the most upsetting, while I am struggling to find a bathroom that is actually open somewhere - and doing the best I can to stay away from all these people who aren't happy about being trapped at home - they fucking will not stay away from me. If I see people anywhere within a quarter mile of me, I stop, and then do whatever I can to keep a huge distance between them and me. But it doesn't seem to work the other way around. Everyone feels the need to keep coming within inches of me. I am terrified of catching this thing. No insurance, no doctor, no health care of any kind and NC of course hasn't expanded Medicaid. I wonder how many homeless people have died and are going to die from this thing who won't be counted. If you actually live in a place that has got its act together and got you into a hotel, let me know because from what I can tell it is just pure fiction around here.",DJ44x,92,1,9,1231

During all of this ""Stay at home"" order stuff that has been going on, I have obviously been stuck outside, in public, near other people who I either can't get away from or who won't stay far enough away from me. I have no running water to wash my hands, nothing to ""construct"" a face mask from, and when I try to search for any disinfecting items or masks anywhere - there are none anyway. All these things they are repeatedly telling everyone to do - I can't do just like all homeless people can't do. And even though I have spent hours every day searching for help from the city, the county, the state, - everywhere - there is none for homeless people. At first they were just saying to go to a shelter. Yeah, I've seen how that's been working out with everyone getting sick. But what I don't think most of these normal people (who are sitting at home watching TV on their comfortable couches, snacking on foods that they get delivered from their favorite restaurants) understand is just how bad the options are.  And it is a lot worse for us. First, nobody on the planet who hasn't already been infected is immune, and nobody will be until they develop a vaccine. That isn't going to happen for at least 18 months, most likely. So your choices as they stand right now are - get the virus, get really sick, hope you survive and aren't in the 20% who have to get hospitalized, or stay locked away from everyone and everything - and hope that you clean everything that comes near you well enough to keep from being infected. I don't care how long you try, it is only a matter of time before you miss something.  People aren't going to stay inside for a year. So almost everyone is going to get sick sooner or later. The shitty thing is that homeless people are like on the front lines with no protection and nobody cares. I expect to get sick every day. I can't go inside, I can't stay home, they've closed and locked all of the places that would have helped. Of all the fucking times to close all the bathrooms and prevent any access to hot water and soap.  It is bad and it is going to stay bad for a long time.",DJ44x,159,3,9,1231

fttn12,"Human Traffickers Operate Most Homeless Shelters Homelessness and Human Trafficking are often tackled separately. But the cycle is perpetual, human traffickers wear down victims to become slaves, and most homeless organizations aren't prepared to take on multilevel fraud, that is if they aren't founded to purposely profit from taking advantage of vulnerable populations. Layers of fraud also appear in domestic violence shelters, but the equation differs in that DV shelters pronounce a facet of financial abuse from a person. Homeless shelters rather leave the ""f"" silent and pretend the homeless aren't victims of the financial abuse of many criminals - most shelters gaslight victims of crimes who end up homeless and tell them that their victimization was resultant of  needing to learn something. All homeless people need to learn is that they became that way because of criminals who capitalized off flash mobs screwing them.

I was just thinking of how the economy changes based off everything, and I couldn't help but think that many homeless people are currently homeless because of how difficult getting into a rental is. I think many homeless people and families are capable of paying rent, and supporting themselves but because of prior evictions or trouble coming up with deposits they have trouble finding housing that accepts them.

ftc4y1,"Big homie's guide to homelessness So you've found yourself homeless through whatever circumstances they may be: What's your next move? What are your options?

Homeless OG is here to provide you with an easy-to-use guide to help you through this trying time.

&#x200B;

1. Location, location, location! Perhaps you've found yourself stranded in a tent in the woods or living out of your car. I will start by saying these two options are vastly preferable to shelters of any kind. In homeless shelters you may be forced to, get this: maturely and responsibly deal with other grown adults in a closed setting. We all know homie don't play that and any mother fucker who gets out of pocket is gonna have to get these hands, which leads me to suggest avoiding these places at all costs. This leads to our next bullet point..

&#x200B;

2. The LAW! While I personally recommend doing everything in your power to avoid legal troubles while homeless, we all know that sometimes you may be forced (or think you're being forced) to stay in one spot due to various legal proceedings that you may be involved in.. fuck that! Keep your head down and away from various agents of the law as long as you can and if you get caught up in any bullshit that requires you to stick around town, try to at least to keep a low profile. However, once you're in the clear legally, high-tail it outta town as fast as you can. Speaking of splitting town, this segues into our next point:

&#x200B;

3. Getting out! Now that you know Johnny-law isn't on your ass to stay put, we can start working on leaving the immediate area. Do you have any close friends that can take you in? Has your close family given up on you or just plain tired of your bullshit? Here's a simple way around those hurdles: Your significant other! Your boyfriend/girlfriend must surely have some relatives somewhere in another state that you can crash with/mooch off of for a while. Try to really drive home to your boo the necessity of getting the hell out of dodge and in the process, homelessness itself. Remember that once you're in the clear and safe behind walls and civilization, you can write a handy how-to-guide like this one, showing off to everyone online what a tough time you had in your couple of months of homelessness and espouse your expert wisdom on the subject. They don't know how hard it is out here! 

A tip i've included in this point is to not let your boo catch you commenting on any NSFW subreddits, especially those based on ebonyBBWs or the like or she'll have that ass in the dog house right quick, G!

&#x200B;

I wanna close out this guide by finally saying that once you get back to being housed, try as soon as possible to get a game console so you can get right back to playing that vintage copy of Grand Theft Auto 4. You know a playa's mad skills atrophy on the streets and nothing gets those reflexes back up to par like cruising around with Niko Belic on the streets of liberty city but the streets of Liberty city will feel easy compared to the streets you survived on for a few weeks!

Same as the title, I want to find a homeless person near my house (Vancouver) and want to try to give them another chance at life. I have a $3,000 dollar budget roughly. I would appreciate it if you guys can help. (I'm going to be waiting until the COVID-19 outbreak slows down a little bit before doing anything, but wanted to prepare/research while I'm free).

I was thinking, with this amount of money, I can get a cheap car (\~$1,000), a cellphone with a 1 year plan (\~$500), clean clothing + other necessities (\~$300), and the rest for drug rehab (\~$1,200). I've heard doing these things would help a homeless person get a job and then eventually an apartment, etc.

What do you guys think? Is there something else I should look into before finding someone? Is my budget too small for such an expedition and should I instead focus on contributing a little for a large number of people rather than all for 1 person?

Found myself a thousand miles away with nothing but my dufflebag and a hundred dollars. I worked a couple jobs and found a work exchange then lived inside for a couple weeks. 

Well, the job didn't work out and neither did the work exchange so I went back to the thing I'm good at: traveling. It was harder than I remembered. A lot harder. I was undergeared. My body can't take the stress like it used to. My mind couldn't either. 

So I hitched north and found myself in a national Forest. Then found myself in the next town north after a kind stranger gave me a lift. The night before I was dehydrated and hallucinating in the woods, in bear country.

Just as I'm about to bed down for the night I hear someone trying to sell a car for cheap. Insanely cheap. So I buy it. The catch is, all I had was a bill of sale and a suspended license. Still a thousand miles from where I left the previous month. 

I make it about two hours before getting pulled over. The whole time he's running my ID I'm praying, bargaining, what have you. I'm sure my car is going to be impounded and I'm going to jail.

fbw810,"Just thinking A few months ago I had run into an elderly homeless lady, she asked me for some money , I told her to wait till my mom got out the store so I could exchange the 10 I had for a 5$ and give it too her. I had a feeling to ask her how she was doing, so I did. She explained how her family refused to take her to the hospital to get her wrist operated on, how ride to care also said they could bring her there but not pick her up, this is in isolated Alberta Canada. Her wrist was swollen, huge compared to her frail frame. We talked about the mistreatment from her family, and my mother came out and I gave her the 5$. Honestly I didn't care if it was going to be spent on drugs or alcohol, I just wanted her to be comfortable . Withdrawal is something I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. As she walked away, I told her ""take care of yourself"" and she looked at me like no one had ever told her that in her entire life, she was surprised and turned around and came back to talk some more. I told her about some resources in the area that are worth a try for the elderly, and as we ended our conversation I told her god bless, she said ""I love you"" and I said it back. It made me realize just how much these neglected people crave love, they are people just like us. And they need love and care. Even if you can't help financially , an ear to listen is what they need.

Spend my days at the library, reading, writing, drinking (with ninja stealth of course, how else). They close at nine, I grab my shit, steal food at the store, then bike a mile back to the nature reserve, hoping my tent is still there.

Only been doing this for like two weeks, it came out of the blue so I had almost no time to prepare, get my gear in order, nothing. This weekend I'm building a better camp further into the woods, this shitty tent will only serve me so long, and it's already breaking. 

Biggest problem so far has not been warmth, food or water, but hygiene. Can't wash my clothes when it's freezing out, nowhere to dry them. Can't dry them by the fire because they'll just reek of smoke. Showers, god damn, I miss showers. And coffee. I'm this close to start bathing in the lake. It's below freezing temperatures here right now, I'm not looking forward to that shit. Last time I did that was literally in the army. Thank god for survival training, I'd be dead without it.

I finally found a room for rent that fit my budget, allowed my two large dogs, and didn’t have any single guys living there. The dogs were definitely the hardest requirement to fulfill. Last Saturday we moved in and Yesterday marked the end of my first week with a stable living situation since November. From November 5th to February 15th I lived in motel rooms, my car, the homeless shelter, and (for the last two weeks) a friends guest room (which doesn’t count IMO). 

When I was at the shelter or my friends house I couldn’t have my dogs with me, so they stayed in long term dog boarding for 56 days. I made payments on their stay every two weeks. Last Saturday we were finally reunited.

I still have a lot of debt, but I think I’m finally in a place where I’m not drowning in it anymore... perhaps I’m doggy paddling.

I was very blessed to have a good job, a car, a safe and clean shelter to go to, supportive family, concerned friends (who didn’t know the whole situation, but were still very helpful), and an excellent dog boarding discount. I understand that those things made my situation a whole lot easier than it is for a lot of people. I was afraid of being laughed off this subreddit the first time I posted. But this is one of the kindest subreddits I’ve come across and I can’t recall even one mean comment.

“Look for those who are out on the street, under the bridges and in the tents, and call the police. Let’s not have another person die this year,” he said. “Telling the police about someone out in a field is not tattling on that person. What that’s doing is helping that person find help.”

I swear this oath, Upon the shoulders of all my forefathers that stood on this firmament before me, and gazing forth into the shadow of all of those who are to come yet.  


I swear this oath so that perhaps those who are yet to come may indeed have a better Earth to tread upon; for it is the sacred and unspoken goal of all good men to leave behind a better Earth than that which they found.


I sweareth this most holy and bonding, I vow unto myself, and swear before any witness that dare come forth:

Shall circumstances arise in which I am to become armed in the presence of anyone possessing a train horn on their vehicle or a muffler modified specifically to make it louder...should these circumstances come to be and I am fully and properly equipped, I will make such a war upon them and their blaspeming ilk that it shall never be forgotten so long as day turns to night. Long ere this day men will speak and sing songs in my honor, and women will tell tales in hushed tones of the day when the Great Shushing swept across the very world.

Never again shall  a walking man be startled into jumping out of his very socks by the unexpected and sudden onset of a downshift into redline on a Shelby Mustang. THESE ARE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ITSELF... And to have this followed by the delighted and off-balance laughter of an overly inbred redneck because they think they're clever...Nay... this is an insult that no man should endure.

In this moment, the first to fall shall be bereft of his throat and voicebox due to an uncommonly well thrown malt liquor bottle!

There will be much cleaving and rending.  NONE shall carry an accursed bloodline through that darkened but most holy of days to see it emerge upon the other side and flower once more. NAY!

Many a cry of ""HOONIGAN!"" will die beneath a gurgle in the throats of those who stand accused.

elj184,"Homelessness = legalized homicide Homelessness looks like society's way of Carrying out legal mass scale homicide. I walk around those encampments, I walk downtown, I walk under the bridge, I used to walk out of my office and see walking coffins, zombies. I feel like how they look, dead inside. I often wonder who they used to be, who they could have been, and if they still have a chance to be...knowing how deceptively easy ""they"" could be me. Then I cry sharing the burden of humanity. Silent tears that never cease to fall.

This morning on my way to get my sister, I hit walmart, bought a bunch of socks, juice, some fruit and pastries....went by the park and dropped them off, just to say thanks for having my back.

Dude follows me around and tells me no backpacks, I pointed out 4 differentnl non homeless ppl with like designer and student backpacks that he had not said a word to, he said it's because I'm homeless that I cannot have one and that I make myself look sketchy by wearing black and having a hat, when he himself had a black outfit and hat... I have $1500 worth of medications on me at all times so I can't just leave my backpack unprotected so I didn't eat tonight. Then a drunk girl comes asking me to use my phone as she lost her purse with her phone and wallet and is stuck outside drunk. I let her but she cannot get ahold of anyone. Her sister calls my phone back once I'm 5 blocks away. I go back and finally find her crying with some sketchy other homeless dude yelling at her. I tell her about her sister calling and she tells me this other dude is following her and scaring her. I run him off and get this sound girls sister on the phone. Drunk girl is too drunk for sister to understand so I give her directions, turns out she is over an hour away. Girl is scared sketchy dude will return so she asks me to stay with her until she gets there and falls asleep on my lap. Basically every person that comes by wakes her up to verify she is okay because they assume since I'm homeless I must be trying to take advantage of her or something's not nefarious. When sister finally arrived I help drunk to the car, I don't ask for anything but sister offers to cashapp me $100 for waiting with drunk.

j7ugo34,I learned about the fundamental difference between rich and working class people long before I experienced homelessness.   I was in an accident about twenty years ago_ and I was in a wheelchair for three or four months. I'd take a bus to physical therapy_ but if the weather was nice_ I'd roll home in my chair. It was about four and a half miles. I lived in a  neighborhood_ but my route took me through an affluent area.  The first time I rolled home_ I got to the end of a block and realized that there wasn't a ramp at the corner. It was a long block_ and rather than go all the way back to the ramp at the other end_ I tried to roll off the curb. I was unsuccessful.  I tipped over and got dumped out of my chair. This happened a block away from a parochial school_ and was right when it was letting out. The intersection was a four-way stop_ and there was a nonstop stream of cars that came to a stop a few feet away_ then proceeded through the intersection. None of them stopped.   I had casts on both legs_ and my broken ribs weren't quite healed yet_ so I was in a lot of pain. I lay there in the gutter for several minutes before I recovered enough to move. It took me another couple of minutes to climb back into the chair. Meanwhile_ the stream of cars continued to roll past.  In my neighborhood_ random people would offer to help me cross the street. There was a block with a very steep hill a few blocks from my house that I chose to go up. I could have gotten to the top by another route that spread the slope out over several blocks_ but I was all about pushing my limits. Pedestrians would often offer to help me get to the top_ and people in cars would frequently pull over and watch to make sure I made it.  I know rich people who have hearts of gold. But many of them (and I think this is more often the case with upper middle class people than with the extremely wealthy) strive to insulate themselves from the gritty reality of how the other half lives.,Rachel_Silver,10,3,3,1530

Typically the cops would just check in to make sure we were okay and went on their way.   When I worked in a much less affluent area_ the only people who called the cops were the ones who were bothered by my dog living in the car with us.  EDIT in the poorer area_ we got a lot of spontaneous help in the form of home cooked meals_ cases of water_ dog food_ and one woman even gave us a bunch of body care products she made herself.

j82gztc,Tiburon California in the 1990s would have the police follow and pull over cars that would be normal cars in most places but that were not expensive enough to be in Tiburon. The police were harassing the servants of the wealthy in an effort to make sure the servants were authentic servants rather than poor people coming to see the views.  Tiburon has great views of San Francisco bay but those views are the property of the wealthy and poor people apparently don’t deserve to see nice views.  I was allowed into Tiburon because I was their taxi driver taking the real people to the airport.  The police were allowed in to protect the rich but the police were also not wealthy enough to be one of the real people.  Wealthy Sausalito 5 miles from Tiburon had a different kinder culture from Tiburon but also had great views of the Bay.  Contempt for the common man was common in Tiburon but not common in Sausalito.

j7vitcp,Thank you for being transparent. Your feelings are valid. Anyone that goes through that kind of cycle_ repeatedly_ is bound to believe that's how their life will remain. It makes sense to feel anxious about your current living situation and what could possibly happen_ especially_ after you've dealt with homelessness on and off for so long.  But the anxiety can rob you of the joy that you could have  from simply having a place to stay. Although_ we don't know what the future holds but all we can do is hope for the best and live in the NOW. Enjoy what you have now. Don't worry so much about the future_ especially about the things you can't really control. Of course it's okay to take preventative measures to avoid being homeless again but letting that fear rule over your mind can take away the precious time you could spend with yourself (and others) in your place of dwelling. With the economy the way how it is now_ nothing is guaranteed to be stable.  You don't want so much time to pass you by and you never got to enjoy what you have now. It's something that you might regret because you could have created a memorable life experience.  I know your pain. I wish I can help more.  It's a blessing to have a roof over your head.

j7symux,Find your closest Mexican community and find a local grocery store. There will be free classified magazines there with potentially cheap room rentals with immigrant families.

j7v7osi,"So_ I'm going to say this_ after reading through your responses and the comments so far.  If your plan is to shoot down or shelve ideas_ in favor of there only being the solution of getting money from people_ that's soft begging and a bad thing around here.  I bring this up_ because... I see a few flags on the field here.  With Job Corp_ as with any job you would apply for_ it is perfectly OK to call/contact them after **two weeks**_ to inquire as to the status of your application.  Feel free to us that exact phrasing... as in ""***Hi.  My name is XXX.  I'd like to inquire as to the status of my application?***""  It has been three months since you applied.  How many times have you contacted them_ and what has been their response?  Your mother says you need to be out_ and one of the reasons she falls back on_ is that you aren't on the lease.  Why not?  In another comment_ you state that you currently have a job_ but that it doesn't pay enough to cover any of the places you could rent that are around you.  Why aren't you paying as much as you can to your mother_ in exchange for her having you on the lease?  I mean_ it is possible_ especially these days_ for landlords to be very strict_ so that they will charge more for additional people living in an apartment.. and I could see the rent increase being more than you could afford_ if everything was made official.  Still... no info as to why you aren't on the lease now.  Another person here asked if you have a car_ and you avoided answering that question.  ***Do you have a car?***  If you do_ is there a reason why you aren't living in it_ or won't consider living in it?  If you do not have a car_ you can likely purchase some beater with even the meager funds you pull in at your current job.  No_ you won't be shopping for the car at any used car lots... nothing that expensive.  You'll be sifting through Craigslist_ walking to all the local welding shops_ and boiler shops_ and bakeries_ etc._ looking for old trucks and delivery vans they would consider selling cheap.  You check the bulletin board in the local library.  You ask at the corner garage_ or at the towing companies_ if they know where you can purchase a car cheap.  You find a local junk yard_ or Pick N Pull lot_ and see if they have any running vehicles they'd sell for next to nothing.  There are options out there for cheap running vehicles.  And that's a house on wheels when you have nothing else.  As to the current arguing... it takes two to argue.  You are 19.  She technically doesn't owe you housing and support anymore_ as you are legally an adult.  So... her house_ her rules.  I'm not saying she isn't the kind of person to find a reason to argue about anything.  I'm just saying it isn't an argument_ if she is yelling and you are just standing there not responding.  You wouldn't ***call*** that an argument either.  >my mom is just doing it as a way to get rid of me because she doesn't want to deal with me  You are 19.  She shouldn't have to ever ""deal"" with you ever again.  You and she are both adults.  If she doesn't want to have to have an experience with another adult where she considers it ""dealing with someone""_ she doesn't have to.  It is one of the perks of being an adult.  That_ and ""dealing"" with the consequences of one's actions and decisions.  Having to ""deal with someone"" is generally a bad and stressful experience.  If you were problematic as a child_ whether she created the monster you were_ or you did that on your own... she legally had to ""deal"" with you because you were her CHILD.  You aren't a child anymore... well_ your body isn't a child anymore.  So if she is pushing for you to join JobCorps_ because living with you is only stress and anger to her... that's completely within her rights.  As bad as that makes you feel_ you cannot change her.  You can only change yourself.  You are equally responsible for your relationship with your mother.  People work jobs they hate_ to support families they love.  You probably could have played the part of a loving daughter (aka_ treated it like a job)_ at least to keep the peace in the home.  I say it like that_ because... again... I'm not discounting the possibility of your mother being impossible to please.  But if you...  *  have a job_ and you  * pay her money towards your rent_ and you * pay for your own meals (and occasionally cook for her)_ and you * clean up the place like you are the maid_ and you * don't have guests over_ or hold parties_ and you * regularly ask her what she needs or wants and promptly fill those requests with priority  ... I can't see her wanting to kick you out.  I can see that as a borderline abusive relationship_ if not an actual abusive relationship... but I can also see it as a way to maintain a status quo_ for you.  Basically going Gray Rock to a Narcissist_ since No Contact isn't feasible for the situation.  You obviously wanted out and away from living under her rules once before.  In the time that you lived with relatives_ how did you change yourself to fix the issues between you and your mother?  I mean... if you didn't do anything to make progress in ""improving""_ at least by your mother's standards_ in the time you were away... you had no reasonable expectation of there being less friction when you moved back.  All this plays a part moving forward.  You have to go... and you have no real ties (from everything you describe) to where you are.  So... go mobile.  Get away from the unhelpful family.  Obtain a vehicle_ and drive to a seasonal tourist town.  Why?  You are 19_ and female.  Tourist towns see a swell in residence and work while they are ""in season""... and then the people and work dry up during the ""off season"".  In Season_ many of these employers offer pay AND housing_ in exchange for you being on call or working long schedules.  These are jobs like... selling T-shirts and towels_ or selling/renting Ski gear_ waitressing_ bar tending/backing_ working a counter at a deli/bakery/motel_ cleaning motel rooms_ etc.  You could summer on Cape Cod (Massachusetts)_ and Winter in Key West (Florida)... making that long drive twice a year_ when the local In Season end.  **Chincoteague_ VA is only a stone's throw away on the coast_ and that's Seasonal Tourist_ with fuzzy ponies.**  The point there_ is that being 19 and female_ you have the greatest chance of walking into ANY of the jobs in these towns.  You fit the profile of what they want between their registers and the tourist's money.  College age girls make up the bulk of the seasonal employees in Provincetown_ MA... be it at galleries_ bars_ shops_ restaurants_ etc.    There's migrant work.  Use your youth_ and go pick vegetables for a month and earn $3000 or more.  Where I am in Imperial County_ California_ we have a year-long grow season.  There are crops all year long_ and there is always a need to pick something.  Get a car_ travel the country_ go work hard for a few months or a year_ and get the cash you feel you need to straighten yourself out.  $5000 for a month and a half picking Sugar Beets in Montana or South Dakota... get paid for camping_ working out_ and meeting cool people.",bongart,6,1,8,1024

Not so bad if you live in a place with decent public transit_ but you'll still be judged.  I gave up my license because my state requires you to have car insurance to possess a license_ even if you don't have a car. That was a bad decision but I couldn't afford it.,Oviris,2,1,3,1530

j7u3t92,This is a good comment.  You're a good person.   I'm not sure where this is but my first action after securing shelter would be figuring out of if it's even legal to kick you out for it.  I know in Canada at the very least it's illegal to discriminate based on familial status (which a child counts as_ unsurprisingly)_ and i do seem to recall the US having a similar law.   Other countries i cannot speak to at all.   Either way_  anyone who kicks someone out for having a child is so far below garbage it's poisoning the groundwater.   I hope things start looking up for both their hypothetical future's sake,Ikxale,2,1,1,7

j7sllzw,If the government got out of the way_ non profits and even just individuals and homeless people themselves could build housing for every one.   I have a backyard and would be happy to have  one or two shed-shelters in it where people can have a bed to sleep warm and a place to lock their belongings so they can build their lives back.  If the government wouldn't call that illegal I could partner with a non-profit to build and manage those_ or just do it myself_ or even let a homeless individual do it themselves starting with a tent and upgrading it to a cabin in time.   But the government will shut it down right now.     Similarly non-profits would build SRO's I'd they were allowed but they can't.    So the line that it's not tax payers responsibility to build shelter for folks who can't pay for it is a red herring_ we have more than enough non-profit money to build the shelters but a government mostly driven by NIMBYS who make it illegal to do so.,PurpleDancer,9,1,3,1530

j7safmt,Sorry_ I though the premise was the individual was on the street bc of their decisions. I must have misunderstood.  I actually think we are aligned. I wouldn't go as far as prison. This seems extreme. But I do think something similar is needed. Just housing is a half measure. You really need to control the individual until they are able to be functioning otherwise all you have is someone who may hurt those around him. Taking money from the public to create a public health risk for both the individual who needs shelter and those who have now become this person's neighbor is not the solution.

I got off dry drugs about 6 months before getting housed. I got sober from alcohol on my own 3 months after moving in.  I had a couple single night drinking slips early last year.

j7o2qy1,If you get desperate you can check into a psych hospital. You just say that you are having suicidal thoughts with a plan and intent. Once you are admitted you are stucknfor about a week but if you get in a hospital with good socialnworkers they will get you set up with med-ical state insurance and hopefully into a sober living (these arent neccessarily for drug addicts_ just homes where drugs are not allowed and everyone is expected to be looking for work or working),HowDidIFallForThis,2,1,8,1024
j85b757,1) Do not admit to DSHS that you have any money at all. Take it out of the bank. Put it in your pocket or someplace safe. Any money that you have they will deny you getting GR or even CalFresh. They will want a copy of your bank account. So pull out the cash immediately and then don't use it for at least a month and then apply for GR or CalFresh if you can hold off that long. If you can't_ take the money out and then don't admit that you have a checking account_ they will ask you how you been managing your money though. So the first way really is the best way. Leave $2 in the account just to keep it open.  2) If you get into a shelter_ do not admit that you are going into a shelter because they will cut down your GR to less than $100.   3) Use every organization resource in your area. Ask for help in whatever way they can offer it and follow-up. The people who follow up and show that they're serious about getting rehoused and getting a new job will get job assistance and housing assistance as well as medical.,Antique_Radish8823,2,1,3,1530

j7pk15v,Wow... A lot of answers are great but first you need to assess the situation and your assets. Who can you call for help? Have you called 311(if they have that in America...)? Do any friends have a sleeping bag_ or a couch to sleep on? Are you wearing the proper amount of clothing for the season/environment? These are the first steps.  So with that it's a fork in the road. You either have a friend or a shelter providing a place to sleep and hang out_ or you're still on your own. If someone is there to help_ congrats. Maybe throw a couple bucks their way or donate a couple to the shelter helping. It's always good to contribute when homeless or not because it sticks with your soul.  If you didn't get help that's ok. You will need a sleeping bag_ a sleeping mat_ a reusable water bottle_ a backpack to carry it all_ and a location to sleep. If you don't know a secure and private place to sleep or hang out I would suggest looking for one next. A good idea is to find a spot and keep revisiting throughout the day to get a feel of what people or animals will be coming and going in the area. Cardboard makes good insulation and reflects body heat back to you and is great resistance to the coldness.  I think that's all you are looking for.

j7mdkmm,Do you have mosquito problems over there? I'm all the way in North Carolina_ 3_000 miles away. You can get a mosquito net for the hammock.    You want to get a mosquito net that's entirely separate from the hammock and wraps around it.  They're a little more expensive but less hassle in the long run.  I would advise against getting a hammock with mosquito net sewn on to it. Those things are usually tiny and the mosquitoes can still bite you through the bottom of the fabric. But those are the cheapest setups so it wouldn't hurt to try it out at first. Use a sleeping pad to keep the mosquitoes off your back and butt.    You'll need a foam sleeping pad on cool nights to stop your body heat from escaping through the bottom of the hammock. They're about $3 to $20 at Walmart.  Hold on...,Oviris,2,2,3,1530

As you have a little time to assess resources nearest you this is the time to talk to United Way's 2-1-1 or [211.org](https://211.org) website and see what other public and private organizations can help you. 2-1-1 will help localize those resources for you. 3. You may be able to get some temporary rental assistance_ if needed_ from private organizations with some listings at [https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental\_assistance\_near\_you.html](https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental_assistance_near_you.html). 4. Plan on getting assistance from Orange County by asking about being signed up for discounted bus fare through the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). OCTA website with bus routes: [https://www.octa.net/Bus/Routes-and-Schedules/Overview/](https://www.octa.net/Bus/Routes-and-Schedules/Overview/). If you sign up with a temp agency you can ask if they offer bus discounts like the Perk Pass. [https://www.octa.net/Bus/Fares-and-Passes/Specialty-Passes/Perk-Pass/](https://www.octa.net/Bus/Fares-and-Passes/Specialty-Passes/Perk-Pass/). 5. Make self-help plan to sign up with as many temporary job agencies as reasonable as it can be for you. See the comprehensive guide for suggestions. 6. Recommendation for a ""starter"" tent is to have a popup tent so as to not not have to deal with the hassle or extra weight of pegs no matter what surface it is placed on. Also make sure there is a tarp underneath the tent and one placed on top. This is to help make sure the tent is not torn on ground debris and as an extra layer against wind and rain.

I tried carrying oranges this past week_ but it is hard when you never know when someone is going to suddenly come in close with no mask_ and it's only something until I can get home. I often can't eat when I go somewhere due to antimaskers. I can't eat if I am in a medical building. It is rude if I am somewhere where masks are required. I can't eat during medical transport. I can't eat if I am walking down a road with a bunch of people or traffic that idk what maskless person is going to suddenly be in the vicinity.  And I am homeless that I have zero way to cook or pack normal food. I can't even afford to eat most days of the week_ and I can't even go inside any businesses to buy anything even if I had the money because no one wears a mask.

I don't even do alcohol or tobacco. The worst ""habit"" I have is my admitted thing for eating too much chocolate when I am stressed. That's it. It's woefully ignorant of you to assume that the reason I am homeless is because I am an addict.   I am not. What I am is chronically ill and unfortunately very much disabled and while that is not your business I am telling you that so you will get a clue and not just assume that everybody who is homeless is homeless because they are addicted to alcohol or drugs. While it is true a certain percentage of homeless people are addicts many of us are not. We're not all mentally ill to the point of it being dangerous either.   If you really want to know why people are ASK them because the real answers they may just surprise you. Most people that end up homeless are not addicted or harmfully mentally ill at all.

j7rgeqa,Even being another chronically ill homeless person myself it never stops breaking my heart a little seeing how many of us there are. I think people want to believe we are all addicts because (and this isn’t fair to addicts either or how addiction works) that’s something they can blame the homeless person for. It’s not too different from how often people love to ask if I was born with my disabilities- they want to believe they’re safe and it couldn’t happen to them. But it can (and frankly so can addiction_ obviously).   Then there’s the folks- the same ones who insist there must magically be all this support for disabled people_ that oh “just get on section 8” like it’s that easy. It’s all people not wanting to face the reality of it all_ how frankly cruel the world can be_ how many of us end up in really bad situations through no fault of our own. It’s easier to carry on with life if you think everyone homeless is there because of a mistake they made or by choice. If you believe all illnesses magically have cures. If you believe that bootstrap mentality nonsense that if you just work hard you can have everything you ever wanted or needed.   It’s not even about us at the end of the day.

j7np06t,Mine was largely because of drugs_ drugs and having nobody who gave a shit about me. Turns out it is easy to get hooked when you are suicidal anyway.   It made me very cold. Nobody really wanted to help me except my gf (now wife). I used to be way more likely to lend a helping hand. But I remember how people judged me and how nobody wanted to help me_ save for a very small handful of rare times where someone would maybe let me take a shower at their house_ or a time I remember a friend gave me 40 bucks - I think that was the only time that ever happened.   I pretty much dug myself out with almost no help_ I live in a state with no Medicaid expansion. I got on methadone_ and I had to pay $14 a day for it even when I couldn't afford food. No money meant no dose. There was no empathy even when I tried to help myself.  I fear becoming homeless again all the time_ and the scary thing is if it happens again it's not going to be because of drugs. But I am way less likely to help others now_ I don't owe anybody anything (unless the friend who gave me that $40 needed help). All I ever heard while I was struggling was that nobody owed me a damn thing. Fine.   I hate it_ I wish I still believed in a world where people would help me if I was in trouble and I wanted to help them too. I still find myself with the urge to help sometimes_ but I talk myself out of it. No good deed goes unpunished. There was even a time I fell for someones sob story on a similar subreddit_ they claimed they had an abscess and needed medication. It was a scam.   The silver lining of everyone treating me like garbage is that I don't owe nobody shit. If I'm such a piece of garbage junkie_ they shouldn't be asking me for anything anyway.,Suckmyflats,0,1,8,1024

I literally got stuff from trash bags that was thrown out and still wrapped up in plastic from this one coffee place and sanitized the bags just so I could convince myself to eat it.  It was real FOOD_ you know? I could not actually dumpster dive. It was just revolting to me thinking of doing that but otherwise I got food wherever I could.  I used to dream about eating steak and mashed potatoes a lot. I practically lived on chips or breakfast bars some days. I'd go to a local food pantry for a hot meal when I was really broke only to find that whatever they made that day had something toxic in it and I couldn't eat it. Broccoli in particular it was just the bane of my existence some days because a lot of places that serve real food think that it's so nutritious and they mix it into everything. I'm actually so allergic that if it touches other food and I eat it I'm in trouble so I'd just have to leave with a roll or whatever and that would be it that day.  I almost liked being on the street better than being in the shelter because at least the food was edible and I knew where to scounge it. I hardly ever went hungry even money-less on the streets. In the shelter I pretty much starved regularly. I'm really not great at that. Food insecurity is really hard for me because there was a lot of that when I was a kid. If I don't have at least a week's worth of groceries on hand I can feel very anxious.  I have diabetes and fasting is a lot harder for me than it used to be. I find I have to eat at least a protein heavy snack every few hours or I just get sick_ like nauseated sick. If I was on the streets or in a shelter now I'd be very hard up because it's been getting harder to keep my blood sugar at all stable and if I ate now like I was eating then it would not be cool.  I spend a good chunk of my income past rent and that on food and that despite the EBT. The probably upcoming loss of a lot of EBT funds is going to hit me hard and the food pantries around me are not going to be much help. I'm going to be eating less and eating a lot of stuff I shouldn't just to eat.  That's life of late. I mean it is what it is_ but in some ways being street homeless was better in terms of me eating regularly enough. That's sad when you think about it but that's just how not useful the food pantries have been of late. I really need to keep those EBT funds but it looks like it's ""Good luck with that!""  Yesterday one of the women in my building told me very solemnly that she plans on selling her diabetic test strips because she can get extra $$$ monthly doing that. That's real healthy that_ sacrificing not checking your blood sugar just to buy more food_ but I totally get it. They decreased her EBT from $281 to $23. What else is she going to do but find some way to make some other money? She can't work a job_ like me she's too disabled_ so obviously she's going to end up selling whatever she can. No more OTC meds either.  That's the reality of what they are doing by cutting the EBT for millions of older_ disabled people_ for the homeless_ for everyone truly low income sans kids. They know that but they don't really care. I guess we're just redundant these days...",mtempissmith,2,1,9,1231

Outside of swipes which you can get as many as needed_ they give out free dining hall food on tuesdays. They help connect you to cal fresh which is pretty guaranteed. And late night buildings that are open late? If you were a student you could stay for 24 hours at powell or something.

j7iuu36,They could be something cool to offer. Yes people already have enough to worry about_ and yes there are libraries_ but some homeless people still like to read_ still like recommendations from other people. Ask the individual_ tell them why you want to give them the book_ make it personal and kind and not just cleaning out the closet and it could mean a lot to someone. Chances are_ it will become trash. But I'm pretty sure that a library will take in books if they are in the right condition_ so maybe suggest that_ especially if they already go to the library. Free library cases are also a really neat way to get rid of your old books.,Amazing-Help-5092,7,1,3,1530

Any time I spend reading now is on here & kids books to him lol.   But I had so many homies that were homeless that read to pass the time. Have heard a lot of ppl say it distracted them from their sometimes uncomfortable/unfavorable living conditions.  They traded books and told each other titles to 'keey an eye out for. Always thought that was cool. I love those little ""Community Libraries"" - like the ones where ppl leave books on like a take one/ leave one sorta basis. It always makes me SO mad when I walk by and they're destroyed or littered with trash. I usually try to pick up a little if I find one like that.  Side note —I hate how the homeless get blamed for shit like that but every homeless homie of mine who frequented them (and every homeless person I've ever seen at one in general) has always been so respectful!    If your town/city doesn't have those & you have the means at all I would try to start one!

I definitely have books on my “homeless helpful list” that I haven’t been able to borrow from the library_ but they tend to be fairly specific and hard to just find anywhere (I’m mostly seeking foraging books).

j7oxtaf,My time being homeless started after I fucked up and misread the schedule on when I was supposed to work_ and noone could get in contact with me because my phone didn't have service. With the company I work for_ it's three no-call no-shows before you're terminated.  The guy that had the shift before meessed up and called the district manager_ and not the store manager.  For roughly about half of the year and a month I was homeless I lived in one of two shelters_ one Salvation Army_ and one that doesn't exist in a 'chain' (single location).   The other half I lived outdoors. For a while it was under a bridge near a creek_ and another lady slept there too. On Saturdays there would be a church service there_ so I had to wake up a bit earlier than normal so I could pack my things and set them aside so chairs could be set out. I'm not what some people may call s Christian_ but I kinda miss those services.  After my 'roommate' checked into a shelter_ I moved everything of mine to a more public and visible place across the street from the library. That way if a guy came by and wanted to do things and wouldn't take no for an answer_ I was closer to a place I could go for help.  Though that was in Texas_ and I was breaking one of the anti-homeless laws. I was ok for a few weeks_ but one day I was leaving the library to go eat lunch_ and three police officers cornered me (well_ sorta?) And one asked me if my name was such and such. He said that I needed to move my things or they would be tossed in the trash in what I remember as an annoyed/angry sort of tone_ and him nearly touching my back with his chest as he and the two other officers went with me to my 'spot'. I kept my cool_ said yes sir/no sir_ and cleaned my spot like they said to. I'm not sure if me doing that made a difference_ but one of the officers called the Salvation Army on the Arkansas side of town_ and offered to take me and my things to the health clinic for a covid test_ and I walked the short distance to the SA shelter.  Then maybe around the last week of December_y former boss told my mom to tell me to reapply to the store I worked at_ and when the 1st day of 2022 rolled around_ I wasn't homeless anymore. Stayed withy aunt for two or three weeks until I could get an apartment of my own- those first three weeks or so I was making bank in overtime.   The time I spent in the not SA shelter_ I got a diagnosis of major depression and general anxiety_ but without access to transportation most of the time_ I couldn't go back for refills on my meds when they.ran out.,Oragami,1,1,3,1530

j87oqm6,"Eh. Not homeless myself_ but I've slept a couple nights in the car in Calgary and spent more then one night on occasion sleeping in the University of Calgary and it seems ok I guess. Can't really see where'd you'd go if its winter out though. Train stations are regularly swept through here due to the amount of addicts smoking in them and unless you're clean most places seem to afford enough security to kick you out of them. Also not a lot of nice spots around here from what I've seen_ cause a lot of the construction here is newer.     Though I can't say the people here treat the homeless as particularly bad either_ mainly because I don't think most people see it as a massive problem in Calgary compared to other major cities. Most of the homelessness is restricted to the C-train lines and therefor your only really walking past them during the part of the day your commuting. Kind of a - not bothering me yet so I'm not going to worry about it yet- kind of mentality_ where we're just glad we're not Vancouver yet_ and thus don't really bother the homeless_ nor try to improve it. Seems we've adopted a motto of ""Just be clean shaven"" around here and ask you to not be strung out on Fentanyl in public_ and so long as you can do that no one will bother you. Lots of volunteers though for whatever reason.",Icy-Weather2164,1,1,3,1530
j7g8mlf,My take: people who looked down on us and never dreamed they’d end up here find themselves homeless_ and decided the term was unpalatable to their sensibilities.   So they changed it up.   Now they can feel better. Still homeless though.,12characters,6,1,3,1530

j7fkwfi,I lived on the street for 13 years and One thing I'll say_ that I wish I'd had learned earlier on that I try to pass on to people now in regards to sleeping bags...especially in cold weather like this.. is when you look for a good sleeping bag...make sure you find the COMFORT rating and not just the survival rating. Like most of the cheap bags you'll see at places like Walmart that will have the rating shown_ usually 40-50⁰ or whatever...that generally the survival rating...NOT comfort rating. By that I mean even if you find a bag that's survival rates at 30⁰ it doesn't mean you'll be comfortable or even completely warm..it just mean it will keep you alive. If you can afford it_ I have the Stansport Flannel sleeping bag comfort rated to 0⁰ and that thing cooks me_ and I've slept in it down to the lower teens and not felt a thing with just sleeping in my long johns (also another good thing to buy). Paid about $80 on Amazon for it_ well worth the money..though it is a tad heavy at 5 pounds.  Good luck out there OP,lightsaber_lobotomy,2,1,3,1530
j7emrgk,Get a jackery and a heating pad. This will keep you warm at night lol. Jackery can be bought at harbor freight and it holds a good charge for a long time. Just keep it safe and dry. or If you have money get a heated vest_ keeping it bowered usually comes with a brand power pack so it might not last as long tho.   Have a small hygean bag. Mine has nail clippers_ man scape buzzer for cutting hair. Some siccors and stuff. Keep your tooth brush in its own thing so it doesn't get dirty. I use one of those sealed coffee mug for my tooth brush and toothpaste. I can carry it anywhere and people won't think much of it.. you may also need a hammer_ utility blade_ you need to keep your feet dry no matter what so extra socks in a dry bag. A small pocket mirror. Some good mechanic  tweezers. I have a set of 6 that are different shapes for different things. I use them to keep my hands clean and to clean small objects and to fix smaller things.,FederalDatabase178,2,1,3,1530

A Swiss army knife or_ better yet_ a Gerber multitool is good to have as well.,Rachel_Silver,1,1,3,1530

If you have a spot to plug it in the back of your car_ all the better. My niece lowers the passenger seat and lays the grill on top and makes eggs (a six pack of eggs don't go bad in a few days) toasted bread_ grilled cheese_ etc. I plug in the bag and put in tinfoil wrapped sandwiches for a warm lunch or a Pyrex to warm canned soup or beans.

j7i6rdf,Free sign is a solid idea. Saw it a lot living in a major city. I know_ no matter how needy I am_ if I see a random jacket or something in the park I tend to assume it belongs to someone and I’m not going to touch it. And you sometimes get the type of folks who will take things to a lost and found or post in neighborhood groups about finding an item.   I’d also toss out looking to see if you’ve got a community pantry or fridge type thing around. Or even one of those Little Free Libraries (I used to help care for one that would sometimes get food items and sanitary products) but be mindful they do often have rules and not all will take clothing items but those are heavily utilized by folks in need.,Tzipity,1,1,3,1530

j7epy3x,Things have changed a lot…finally got around to visiting back where I lived during my college years.  Used to_ seemed like most everyone kind of knew to just put things close by a dumpster or in certain areas.  Now with how much the market has changed everything_ laws have been put in place to further punish_ harm_ and prevent those in our society who are in the most need of support in getting it.  I saw this has all changed.  It’s as if the area has carted off anyone suspected of being homeless.  Plenty of the usual over privileged in the area though and broken glass everywhere still.,missfire23,3,1,3,1530
j7fzeky,I actually wouldnt leave consumables out like that_ or even give them directly.

These items often end up simply being thrown away due to the risk. So maybe buy fast food gift cards?,irrationalhourglass,4,1,3,1530

I use google maps on satellite view and zoom in to find a spot with trees and bushes I can hide in.   I'm also willing to go to spots that other people won't. I stayed in an old staging area for road construction in Savanah_  GA. There was a locked gate with bushes on either side where I could just walk around the side of the gates.   Never let anyone see you come in or out. I never take anyone back to camp_ and I never tell anyone where I'm camped. If they ask I just lie and vaguely say 'I'm up over that way a long way out_' and point in a direction away from camp.,CarlHungus2,13,2,8,1024
j7e0ted,I was going to reply to the OP that being as comfortable as possible is a big factor for being happy. A premium spot goes a long way towards that.    In South Florida it will be miserably hot at night 9 months of the year. So not only does my spot have to be safe and dry; it has to have electricity. Having a fan makes a world of difference. Keeps you comfortable and keeps the mosquitoes away. The electricity doesn't have to come from an electrical outlet. You can buy a converter from Home Depot. It turns a light socket into an outlet.,Amusingly_Confused,3,1,3,1530

On Saturday and Sundays the area has green markets with vendors that always could use some help. At the end of the month you can post up at Ryder or Uhaul and have work in less than an hour.  I would rather work a couple days of the week than:  1. Wait 3 hours to take a timed 20 minute shower.

10u5t0f,j7eapwn,,It's nice that they are beautifying the city, maybe they aren't thinking of the homeless population or actively discouraging it. I guess y'all could always try to find another headquarters to group up at. I don't know, like I've been trying to work on a project to help but I know sometimes being homeless is a culture of it's own too. It's sad that the city is changing for you, it's hard to say who is right here because for one being homeless causes some filth on the streets and garbage and then also sometimes those places are the most comfortable spots to be in. The benches were usually there for pedestrians and older people who have trouble getting around, they weren't intended to be slept on. I wish instead of changing things to be discouraging they would actually work to help you out. I am trying to see what I can do but it's really hard for a lot of people right now, and I don't have a lot of resources but I've offered my home to a few people that never made it here because they decided to do something else.

For food go on website and put city or zip code and donation sites pop up. For crates and vet care you have to call them. They are in Nevada and help anywhere in U.S. and parts of Canada. They are open 9-3pm but remember time difference when you call. I used to call 1-3pm my time EST to talk to anyone. They paid for my cat to have an operation to remove a tumor from his ear.

j78ndiw,In the confessions of a North Korean defector_ he stated that he was happier in North Korea because he knew all of his neighbors_ rather than the daily grind of chasing after the vanity like they did in the South. Of course_ they were also less likely to say things freely around one another for fear of getting reported.  Neighborhoods typically aren't designed around bench tables for people to come out and share bread. Well_ unless you're homeless. According to the end part of [Luke 10]_ the servers at a restaurant that sit down to listen to their guests have the better part_ rather than those who try to look busy getting more water.  Communities like this exist today. In Israel_ they are called a kibbutz. Your labor is to the benefit of everyone_ and what you own is held in common. What exists in America with tent cities attempts to start down this path_ where neighbors know one another and learn to trust and watch their things when they leave.

j7cg3l5,Everyone talks about the idea of women bullying transwomen in the shelters but nobody talks about transwomen bullying women in the shelters because it doesn’t want to cross their mind that this happens. Between late November last year and January that’s exactly what happened in my shelter room with two different people. Not to mention hogging the bathroom for hours that has to be shared by 10 people in the room to “tuck their penis”. It begs the question of why someone with a penis should be given more rights in a women’s shelter. Not to mention threatening to beat people up and mace people twice in the same day right in front of the administration. Not to mention the racism by the second one_ 3 weeks ago_ toward an Asian room member who was called an ugly Chinese bitch everyday (but if she said “you’re not really a woman” that’s discrimination huh) all because she told them not to smoke in the bathroom which is against the laws of the city. Despite them literally threatening to get a friend to come to the shelter and beat her up or kill her the next day. I recorded that on video and what did the front office do? Nothing but coddle. But people draw the line when an elderly_ disabled woman accidentally says “he”.   There are other transwomen here who have no issues with anybody because they’re kind_ not violent and malicious toward people.,No-Baker-9919,5,1,3,1530
j791qid,Your looking more and more like the opposite gender but not exactly being the one you were born can lead to some serious bullying and potential violence. It's cruel if you ask me but they think they are doing it to protect you. Trans people are the subject of a lot of violence in and out of shelters but it can be bad in them.   We had two trans male to female people and one who was transitioning to male in my women's shelter which was for people with mental issues_ addiction issues_ and physical disability. All 3 of them went through absolute hell because the women in the shelter did not accept them and bullied them_ even beat on them trying to get them out of the shelter. It was a constant fight especially when it came to sharing bathrooms.   In a perfect world you would be able to be wherever you felt the most comfortable but we don't live in a perfect world and though their way is wrong headed it's just how it is in a lot of places for now.   I was amazed that they even allowed the folks with male genitals in at all honestly. But either way it did not go well and all of these Trans people ended up really enduring a lot of abuse all round. Being homeless sucks in general but being LGBTQ and homeless is practically hell on Earth.   Sorry...  🤗🤗🤗,mtempissmith,3,3,9,1231
j7ozu3s,The last month I was homeless_ I was in a Salvation Army shelter_ and with my now ex (a trans guy). Since he is still legally female_ he was on the ladies side of the shelter. I'm not sure if they could have put him on the men's side if he was legally male- maybe?  The people that knew he was trans didn't seem to give any fucks_ and he never got any hate that I know of. But that's just in my area_ it could be different in another place.,Oragami,2,1,3,1530

We current have two MTF guests and they’re doing really well_ we surprisingly don’t have really any issues with this (given the blatant homophobia and misogyny a lot of our guests have_ both men and women).  A lot of the ladies are very concerned for their comfort and safety.  This is against the norm though - this is not the case for most shelters.  I hate to have to do it_ but I generally suggest to clients might want to go to the shelter that they “pass” better in.  Which is a horrible term and I make it clear it’s not coming from a place of my transphobia_ but just trying to keep them safe in a rocky environment.

j7a799a,I think the way Homeless shelters are modeled and run overall needs to be reformed and updated. I think there would be less need to segregate if the conditions were better within the shelter. Like more space for more rooms and bigger buildings with additional floors that maybe could be could be segregated that way. Everyone should have a safe_ clean place to go. While there does need to be shelters specifically for women and children  just because of higher risk and those who are fleeing domestic abuse situations. The focus doesn't always need to be on that and I can see how that ends up happening. Moving forward when creating new shelters the focus should be on providing clean_ safe spaces for all who need it and their pets.      There is a great new shelter that just opened up here in my county they accept anyone regardless of gender and pets! It's run by a Anti-poverty Fellow at a local university who has been an amazing advocate for the homeless over the years. She treats people with respect and dignity and understands there is more to helping people then just providing a space to sleep or eat. Which is why the shelter is also going to have a floor that provides wrap around services to help people with whatever they need whether it be health/mental health services_ helping people get benefits and/or job programs etc... she also partnered up with some of the businesses in the community to come in and provide free services like haircuts from a local barber. She's pretty much removed any barrier she legally could to allow as many people possible to have access.      Which brings me to another major issue. The barriers to even accessing shelter for anyone are ridiculous and far too difficult.  Here in my county all of the shelters are gatekept by the non profit organization the county made responsible for handling our CoC. No one can access anything without going through them first and they have a habit of regularly turning people away. You have to basically fight to get any help and that's when you DO qualify for help. Anyone on drugs (even marijuana) or who has a criminal record ( no matter how minor or old the offense) automatically doesn't.  Unfortunately the need for shelter is great here so all the shelters remain full on a regular basis. When this happens they will pay for you to stay in a motel but only for a limited amount of time_ 2 weeks. Then they will literally say fuck you you're SOL. It happened when I was homeless not only did I have to fight to even get any help for a month after being turned away the first time. They paid for a motel for two weeks ( I was homeless with my disabled mother and dog for 4 months). Even when cried on the phone with them having a panic attack telling them that we would die on the street_ nothing. The way the homeless are perceived in this country is a disgrace systemically. Which is why the government services are usually terrible and ineffective.,That_Girl_Cray,6,1,3,1530

j7a8hd7,That's also how it's done in my city. The women's shelter is at a secret location and women get picked up to be taken there.   The men's shelter has a day services building next to it for men_ women and families. Anyone can walk in off the street for showers_ laundry_ medical care_ internet and free coffee. Or just take advantage of the heat/air conoitioning.    There's a cafeteria in the back of the day services building. The men's shelter uses it on the weekdays but they have massive feasts on the weekends for everyone. Lot of good food served by various businesses. Sometimes a corporation or charity comes to the weekend feasts to hand out grab bags.  Downside:  The day services facility is always overcrowded. Long lines for showers_ laundry or medical care. You gotta get there first thing in the morning to even make it on the wait list. Then you wait for hours with no guarantee of services.  It's normally predominantly men with about 3 or 4 women on the week days. But you'll see dozen's of women there on the weekend for the feast. There are family rooms but I've seen more famlies in the surrounding wooded areas than at the center. I've never seen the family rooms used.

I was there for 2 months with my sister until her blood flow issues forced us to get motels for our safety.  Long term survival tips: Get food stamps and hopefully cash aid. Go to food banks in addition to that. Get vitamin gummies and drink a fuck ton of water to stay healthy. Do delivery jobs to make extra money to survive. Sign up for DoorDash and UberEats. Donate plasma for extra money. Look up odd jobs on Craigslist for money. Craigslist also has rooms for rent. Transition to a sales job where there’s less to no cap on what you make (solar_ insurance industry_ etc.) if possible. Or whichever industry you can do some type of independent contracting to avoid a set wage limit. If you don’t have one already eventually get a storage unit for your important belongings If you need a laptop for work you can finance one through Best Buy. Mine’s 30 a month. Look up Volunteers Of America for the best resources near you. We were calling 211 almost everyday until we found stable resources through VOA. Good luck!,Agreeable-Let-1474,10,1,3,1530

j76kbnb,Two of the biggest mistakes I've learned that people make when confronted with homelessness are 1) being too embarrassed to ask for help and feeling like you're somehow a burden on others_ and 2) choosing to be homeless because of №1 and thinking it'll be very much a temporary situation. There's a reason why all the old religions talk about pride being a bad thing.  If you have friends and/or family around_ cast aside your pride_ come clean_ and ask for help. That's what friends and family are for_ just don't abuse it.  Shit_ even if it's just using their address on job applications and using the shower and WiFi every other day that's a huge advantage towards getting back on your feet. Let *them* decide how much help they're willing to give_ and take it. Pay it back later. If they offer a couch or a room_ take it_ and put effort into cooking_ cleaning_ and making minor repairs if you know how which will show them appreciation and that you aren't trying to get a free ride.  Good luck out there.,BoneHugsHominy,9,1,3,1530
j76gdqy,Best advice I can give u to get out of that situation is to try to find a local church that u feel comfortable going to_ and go there every week get to know the people because u really need a support network. Don’t tell anyone initially that u live in your car. Church people are just more likely to want to help u get connected with possible place but the key is to gain trust of the decent pple in the community. Not immediately_ u won’t be helped but once pple get to know u and see u are not a problem person who is choosing to live in car_ but bc of circumstances.,Difficult_Ad_9392,7,1,3,1530
j7795po,"I have a full house with someone on the couch but if my friend told me they were sleeping in the car I'd give them a month or two on my recliner to get a job and a place to stay.

Sometimes we had interesting combinations but everyone always ate.  Hell my husband put in a shed in the back yard_ insulated it_ put in a sink and an air conditioner_ ran an electrical line to it with two electrical outlets and that's another bedroom now.

They may say no_ but if you don’t ask_ you won’t know. All of them can be in your situation too; it’s not like they are immune. True friends- don’t see you as a burden.,Mean-Copy,4,3,12,1488

j774rd9,"> I often go without a good night's sleep because I'm always worried about being caught.  I called it the 3AM Knock.  I dreaded it.  That fear did_ however_ drive me to do two things.  First_ it made me dig as deeply as I could into exactly where people \*are\* allowed to park overnight... and how I could exploit that.  Two... it eventually made me drive to where I am now.  If you are still worried about being discovered... start looking at the Park N Ride system in your state/county/area.  If the metro area where you are isn't that big_ you may have to expand your range to find active Park N Ride lots.  In most states these facilities are the responsibility of the state Department of Transportation... which means that they are monitored/patrolled by the State Police_ as opposed to the local cops in the cities/towns where the parking lots are actually located.  State Police have a slightly different... view... on minor crimes.  Usually.  At any rate_ there are specific rules for that state's Parn N Ride system_ and there are also rules that are specific to each parking lot_ and they have to be posted AT that parking lot.  Let me put some concrete down here.  From September 2017 until September 2018_ I lived in a Park N Ride lot_ on the line between Lacey and Olympia_ in Washington state.  The lot at Exit 109.  The rules of the lot were simple.  No vehicle could be left unattended for more than 48 hours.  The lot wasn't responsible for belongings left in vehicles_ or vehicles left in the lot.  According to two of the State Troopers who would patrol the lot every Sunday_ living in a vehicle legally constituted attending to a vehicle.  So I was actually living in my vehicle_ in a lot where I had State Police \*Protection\*_ if not tacit approval of the fact that I was living in that lot.  And I wasn't alone_ either.  Others lived in their vehicles_ in that lot.  Now_ it was kind of a Perfect Storm_ of sorts.  The Park N Ride lot I was in_ and the others where people could live indefinitely_ were all close to a highway.  The fact that the lots allowed overnight parking_ was to provide travelers with a safe alternative to falling asleep at the wheel_ on a highway system without rest stops.  This being Washington state_ there are generally a lot of vacationers driving their RVs and Trailers up and down the western corridor between Oregon and Seattle.  So_ there was already a system in place_ and it had been for decades_ to provide safe spots to pull off and sleep for the night before moving on.  Around Seattle_ and the 5 cities basically touching Seattle_ there is no sleeping in a vehicle of any kind allowed_ except in specifically designated areas (this was until 2018).  Not the Walmart... all the Parn N Ride lots have specific restrictions against sleeping in a vehicle_ etc.  Head south_ and pre-2018_ you could have slept in a PnR lot in Tacoma_ 20 minutes away.  Now_ with that [state Supreme Court ruling in 2018](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/judge-rules-seattle-homeless-mans-truck-is-a-home/)_ designating a Washington registered vehicle to be a person's home under the state's Homesteading Act_ there are RVs_ Trailers_ Trucks_ and cars parked all over the place in Olympia_ Lacey_ Aberdeen_ etc. with people living in them_ without fear of that 3AM knock.  So.  Start looking.  Some places won't have much_ if any organized overnight parking.  You may have to shift your range 50-100 miles or so.  There are always loopholes somewhere though.  Where around you_ are people expected to sleep off a long drive?  Where can truckers go when they have to stop driving?  I'm not saying that you should park between rigs... but_ there may be a smaller vehicle lot nearby.  Is there a local Park N Ride system attached to the transit system in your area?  Bus transfer stops_ train stations_ etc.  Parking garages without specific restrictions against sleeping in vehicles can be nice and protected against the weather.  Find the highways_ and find the rest stops.  Look for the PnR lots near highways.  Some beach parking lots absolve themselves of all legal responsibilities after a certain time.  Look for industrial areas that have third shifts.  You may be able to blend in with street parking in those areas_ where your vehicle looks like just another worker's vehicle parked for their shift.  Remember.  Any place that allows for organized overnight parking like that... PnR lots_ Airports_ Bus Stations_ Train Stations_ etc... they not only have rules for their lots_ but they HAVE to post them as per federal and state guidelines.  So if the sign at the lot does NOT specifically restrict you from sleeping in a vehicle... you can sleep in the vehicle.  If the sign ONLY says ""No Overnight Parking""... you cannot get in trouble for sleeping in the vehicle during the day.",bongart,7,1,8,1024

By making a loop you do not cover much ground saving on gas_ you have a locked vehicle for added safety and staying dry_ you can have a bit more stuff with you_ and you are not in one place long enough to stand out.

The thief put a knife to my throat and demanded that I give him my wallet. I should have given him my wallet but I did not give him my wallet. I distracted him with $80 from my shirt pocket and got out of the taxi and ran.    Why did he not stab me like he stabbed 6 other taxi drivers? I treated him respectfully and treated him like a friend.  $80 was enough for him to buy more crack without me having to replace my credit card and drivers license.,Shoddy-Donut-9339,1,1,3,1530

j71584h,"I personally went for a camping hammock_ overtarp and underquilt/top quilt combo. Onetigris type brand which is affordable. Or Chinese hiking brands that do down gear but not super expensive. A camping pillow is a good idea. The tarp can be fix in different ways to protect against rain and I used tieoffs to run the water down instead of in_ even used some silicon grease I found at work to make sure the water flowed where I wanted it to.   I slept on a roundabout that is a wooded area island surrounded by roads. I had a spot I chose to cross the road when I could safely see that no cars were coming. This was a couple of miles outside of town center. I used earplugs to help me sleep because of the cars at night but I was relatively safe with all the trees around me.   I used a shovel to dig a bathroom hole. Wetwipes were essential for wiping my face hands and body down_ and I took my trash/waste to work with me every morning.   I used a bicycle to travel and kept tubes and puncture repear kits on hand as well as a pump. I made sure I had a couple of refill water bottles always. I used a powerbank for my phone charging and made sure both were charged before leaving work.   I kept a wet bag type thing for surfing... Used that to store my clean clothes and another one for dirty clothes. Mostly underwear because I wore my work uniform daily. I used a launderette/laundromat weekly to wash my clothes and sometimes went to the gym to shower when necessary. I wore thermal under garments made of wool which I bought discount at go outdoors shop. Which helped keep me warm.  I ate nuts_ sandwiches and things I could buy fresh from the store. I brushed my teeth every day keeping everything in a backpack.  I left my hammock set up every day where it was as I wasn't worried about it being found. But I did also leave a note inside explaining I was homeless and please don't destroy my stuff.  I did this for five months and had a kick ass beard at the end. I learned a lot about knots_ myself_ reliance and also a bit about the ignorance of others. Nobody knew what I was going through and I managed to keep the entire thing secret.

It's cheap and nutritious_ and it's easy to prepare.   I bought a cheap mess kit with a cooking pot big enough to hold a can of soup. I made an [alcohol stove](https://youtu.be/Mg91VsButWE) and bought some 91% isopropyl alcohol (a.k.a. rubbing alcohol) to fuel it. I used cotton gauze (which I was able to get for free) instead of fiberglass inside the stove_ and it worked well enough_ although I have to replace it periodically.   I used an empty Progresso can (they're wider than typical soup cans) to make a wind shield for the stove. It also holds the pot over the stove while cooking. I removed the bottom and used the awl on my Swiss army knife to make a bunch of holes in the sides of the can spaced about two centimeters apart_ widening them with the fish scaler (first time I ever used the fish scaler) until they were about as big around as a pencil.

Not sure about the other locations_ might depend on whether it's corporate or franchise_ but ours is busy enough that we don't really notice or care if someone pops in to use it_ even if you didn't buy something from the store. It's sitting out in the open.   There's also a table in the back you can sit at and eat_ or wait for the bus/get warm. Some of my douchier coworkers don't like the loitering_ but I always let people stay and warm up_ wait for their rides/bus/charge their phones or whatever. We also have pizzas you can buy with EBT_ but can cook in the store for you if you ask. Hope that helps,Engineer_No4915,1,1,8,1024

Big goats come with the job itself_ and if it is cold enough_ you could end up with an old fireman's coat to keep you warm.  Or maybe you'll get to pick through a few left-over coats from their last drive.  And... the ambulance will not only have extra blankets_ but likely thermal blankets and instant hot packs as well.

A condom (bare with me...) 5 as many garbage bags as you can.  First you want to locate a spot where the wind and weather will be minimized. It's a good idea to frequently check the spot throughout the day to get a feel of what people and wildlife will be in the area later.  Once you find the spot and have a fair idea of the atmosphere_ you can either store your cardboard close to the spot or carry it around all day. It's totally up to you. If you are going to store the cardboard make sure you cover the majority with a garbage bag or something to reduce the amount of water or moisture the cardboard collects.  Once it is time to sleep or you are ready to ""relax for the night""_ grab your cardboard making 4 layers or as many as possible under you remembering that the most important area you want heat to reflect back to you is your torso and abdomen.   If you don't have a blanket_ that's where the extra cardboard comes in (if you have enough which you should_ cardboard is free and in trash/recycling bins) there are two ways to go about covering yourself or using cardboard as a blanket.  1 cut the cardboard at the seam making it as long as possible and drape it over you. Not the best idea if it's windy.  2 if the box is wide enough for you to fit your abdomen in lay as many boxes OPEN as you need to cover your body. Like a tunnel on top of the cardboard layers that will reflect your body heat. Crawl into your cardboard tunnel_ and flatten the boxes so that most of your body is enclosed. Get back to me on this part if you need further instructions. I'm still figuring out how to word these instructions...  3 For heat just in case you feel the need throughout the day or night_ that's where the beverage/beer can and condom come into play.

I spent a few extra years at Community College_ finding my path and getting free grants to help pay my bills_ then I found steady work_ finished my BA_ went on to get and MA while teaching undergrad college students_ and now I have a good career_ a super cool son_ and a wonderful fiance_ with whom I'm moving into a beautiful single-family house next month!   I tell you all this because I've been where you are now. I've felt the same longing_ sadness_ and struggle. And I can see the path ahead of you is bright. You've fucking got this. You might still be wading through the sludge right now_ but it's not much further until the best of times.   Keep up with your studies. Be gentle with yourself.

j6sy4sg,"I realize that this might sound very specific... but try to find a 24 hour non-chain coffee shop.. or coffee/donut shop.  You had good luck at this Waffle House... but the chain itself has rules_ and at some point_ someone working there is going to want to enforce them.  It is one of the problems seeking shelter at any kind of retail chain organization.  At some point_ they can and will fall back to using some variation of the phrase ""I'm sorry_ it's just our Policy."" on you... because in doing so_ they can pass the responsibility on to someone above them.  With finding a non-chain shop_ you are dealing with the policies of an owner... potentially an owner-manager.  One person can bend their rules easier than an organization can bend their rules.  The situation you are in can be appealed to an actual person where the buck stops.  They can \*see\* you aren't trouble_ and maybe they can even help_ or trade light work for product.  They are far more likely to wave off ""insurance concerns"" than some large corporation operating a few thousand locations around the country.  Probability.  Probability_ versus possibility.  Like.. playing the odds.  You have better odds at getting sympathetic treatment from an individual than you are from an organization.  Thus... seeking shelter at odd hours with a high degree of probability that they would be sympathetic to your situation_ means looking for independent businesses as opposed to chains.  It is also more probable that one could trade sweeping or taking out trash_ for coffee_ at an independent coffee shop versus any kind of chain shop or restaurant.  This is a Google template search for ""[local 24 hour coffee shop](https://www.google.com/search?q=local+24+hour+coffee+shop)"" and when you follow it_ it will show the 24 hour coffee shops near you.  Check out any and all of the independent ones.  You could even rotate between a few_ so as not to spend two nights in a row at the same one.  Also... with 24 hour coffee/donuts... as cheezy as it sounds... the police become an asset as opposed to a threat.  If you are there_ and the people in charge have no issues with you being there_ when the cops show up for coffee_ they are actually looking out for you as just another patron_ instead of just looking for you as something to be removed.  And of course_ just about all of them have free WiFi_ just like their corporate cousins.  You also have a higher probability of being able to just get hot water_ because you brought your own tea bags/hot chocolate packets.  Less corporate means less pressure on profit per hour_ per table.  At least_ a higher probability of less focus on those things at an independent coffee shop.  At least_ this gives you a goal and direction for nights_ while you figure out what to do.  I'd hit libraries during the day.",bongart,4,1,8,1024

The pay and you can put money on it and when it runs out you just use regular payment.  So just act like oh I didn't know it ran out kinda thing then get groceries.  They won't ask for it for the food.  Idea has some cheap hot food as well.  Taco bell has the cheapest best fast food.  Ranch burrito which is a good size is $2-$2.50 depending on the region.  Ask for a water cup (free) then fill it with soda.  At Costco or taco bell fill a giant container with soda for later with ice (free).  Circle k has sip and save. 7$ for one month of one drink per day included.  Coffee_ cold brew_ iced tea_ soda_ iceys etc.  Get any size cup.  Extra large of course.  Use any cup for any drink.

10q2vod,j6rxjsd,,SSI, Snap, ebt all work with no actual address. Was homeless in Madison County AL free years ago, I know it's not a state requirement. Also, there are multiple organizations and shelters that have staff whose sole job is assisting with paperwork for benefits id's and such at no cost to the individual. If you're being fed the no one will help line cut the person telling you this out of the equation and look into resources.     So, seperate from that a few things you will want to look in to. 1 gym or campground membership. These places have shower/restroom facilities you can use, are cheap, just don't stay there all day every day. 2 libraries are your friend, as a resource for info/net access, a place with free water via fountains, and a place to escape the elements. Nothing worse than being stuck outside in freezing or wet weather. Or stuck in 95 degree humid swamp in the summer. 3 if staying local locate your nearest food banks, soup kitchens, and cheaper grocery stores like food value, aldis, dollar general/tree. 4 Keep toothbrush tooth paste and dry socks available. Like honestly you're better off skipping a meal than not having dry socks and clean teeth. Infected feet or infection in the mouth are both extremely painful and pretty much require a hospital visit. It's not worth the risk.

10q2vod,,j6q7tax,I was thinking the same thing, can the OP explain.  Does SSI just assume that since you are homeless, and don't have to pay rent, that you ***require*** less money??
10q2vod,,j6qf58c,They do not
10q2vod,j6nibaq,,Zillow. Find a bank in your county, walk in. Explain how much your check is, tell them they can have it all, you only need 2 acres somewhere in Alabama to list as your address so you do not lose the check. Do not accept a rental, or anything fancy. Take a run down rotten hoarder property, anything to maintain an Alabama address. Tell them you can handle all the normal people needs like toilets and utilities some other way. All you need from them is a place to put in a garden and have a physical and legal address. Most banks have too many houses and they prefer monthly payments. Do not get big ideas, get the worst, cheapest one, so you can pay it off the fastest. Tell them you have all the other details worked out without them and you di not feel comfortable with a long term mortgage. Visit about 6 dozen banks.
10q2vod,j6p50a5,,Can you use a P.O box and use it as an address? Or many local shelters can be used as an address i’m pretty sure
10q2vod,j6ps1wu,,I have checked ssa online account just the other day. They now allow to receive notifications by email only.
10q2vod,j6qucz6,,SSI and Medicaid and food stamps...none require an address
10q2vod,j6txde4,,Some churches and charities will let you use their address so you can get your benefits. Check around
10q2vod,,j6va9mh,I once had a wild idea to ask churches and charities if i could park in their lots over night, sometimes. When i became homeless i ended up in my car in a place where homelessness doesn't exist. Shitboxes houses that i would never buy sell for $1 million +/-. I asked one charity if they are affiliated with any churches in the area. They are not. After walking and driving around the area i've realized the wealthier population is much worse than where i came from. They don't give time of day and snow in winter. Now i feel extremely uncomfortable asking churches for anything.   Anyone who's near participating religious organizations that openly advertise and offer services are lucky. Not where i am. Homelessness is criminalized and non-existent here. Even post offices refuse to provide mail service for homeless, told me they don't participate, don't know what it is, no one ever asked.
10q2vod,j6v8g9n,,I'm already homeless but don't get SSI because the idea is to deny until my problem resolves itself or i become exhausted and disappear.  I don't think you need an address for SSI payments. It goes into your bank account. My local bank needs an address for me to create an account. I gave my old address because i haven't updated any of my documents and have no new address or proof of any address. I won't be able to pay $24 to the state to update my license every 4 years. I'm not worried about updating and not going to waste money on this nonsense especially if i have no address and no support for at least decent safe housing. I want a tiny space with a private bathroom and shower but i want it in a trailer or container or a tiny home, not in a high risk population area.  Doesn't SSI allow you to apply for a housing voucher? I'm in nj. The system here labels and criminalizes all homeless. It forced everyone into dangerous shelters. I refused. Whoever refuses to go to a shelter is not really homeless. My idiot disability lawyer told me in the beginning i'd be able to get housing when i get SSI but social services told me housing is not guaranteed even for disabled. In other words i'm on my own regardless of my circumstances. There's no support. I'm unable to get usps mail service for homeless. All locations refuse because they don't participate. No homeless population here. I told agencies including soc services and soc security not to send me any mail because i have no address. They continue to send mail to my old address. They can't have the address blank.
10q2vod,,j7muz5o,I was told that if I didn't have an address where I paid rent that the amount was reduced. I know that's true for the temporary cash assistance until your ask is approved but I didn't verify if true for the actual SSI. My cash assistance with a place is $233 a month. I pay $7O rent and electric was 50ish but rates almost doubles so probably $100. I get $63 a month. I use MMJ and that's out now. My doctor just prescribed me Marinol which is synthetic THC in a pill to hopefully help since the marijuana works so well. Otherwise I have to go up on gabapentin  a nd up on my Klonopin. Its already hard to be coherent on my Gabapentin. Im going to be half unconscious drool drooling.
10q2vod,,j7ndz2m,Gabapentin and a few others are pills of choice for pill pushers. Pharma must be giving them good incentives to push gabapentin and others. I've been offered it but i refuse. I'd rather be in pain. Not terrible now but eventually it'll progress.
10q1j9r,j6on2bs,,Maybe try r/almosthomeless since you aren’t homeless?
10q1j9r,j6pma3v,,It probably would be better to find another forum to post in next time. You're not homeless. You just don't like your current living arrangements. You and your husband both work and have enough money to move, but you can't agree on when and where. You also said you're in a HCOL area but you don't want to leave because of your family, Your issues could be resolved with budgeting and better communication between you and your husband. There are people here who would do almost anything to be in your situation instead of in a car or tent or shelter ... or worse. Know your audience. This ain't it.

10przqa,,j6mthiw,Not a bad idea
10przqa,,j6n32pg,I've actually enjoyed it. But I wanted to start 20 years ago, so it was something that's always been in the back of my mind. Helps that I'm a minimalist by nature.  I do plan on getting actual housing once I'm debt free (another contributing factor on the decision to be homeless), that's at least 2 years away though.
10przqa,,j6qqpvu,That’s awesome!  That’s one of the safety fallback options I’ve been thinking about, too.  I was also thinking about working on a ship (seems harder than I hoped), or moving to somewhere crazy cheap like Bulgaria. There’s a lot of digitial nomads there, which, if you think about it, are just cunning homeless people who’ve hacked themselves a better lifestyle. lol.  Which companies do you recommend, if I may ask?  I was thinking of getting the CDL through KLLM, but I’m open to others.
10przqa,j6m8xjv,,I met so many people at the homeless shelter that were there simply for this reason. And they had really good jobs too.
10przqa,,j6n582v,Yeah lol as soon as you say how it is and that the males are absolutely exploited in child support cases you'll get downvoted. No one gives a fk about males in this world.
10przqa,,j6macwa,That's really sad... I know kids need support, but the system that is in place in most states is really fucked up and doesn't factor that the parent paying support also has to survive.
10przqa,,j6mao3e,I had 2 jobs, they were taking $298 each CHECK from each job. One paid weekly and the other bi-weekly. $1788 a month is what was going to child support.
10przqa,,j6ni5dr,She probably spent $88 of that on actual child’s needs.   🤷‍♂️
10przqa,,j6mc1dn,Jesus... which state and how many kids? That's insane.
10przqa,,j6mc6le,2 kids. Utah. I had custody, too which was the more frustrating part. it was back child support.

10przqa,,j6mcfz4,Yeah... once they have you on the hook you are screwed. Modern day slavery.
10przqa,j6msn6a,,Yes. Happened to me. Paying child support  caused me to lose my apartment.  No one gives a damn about men in this situation. We have to suffer in silence.In the end, the kids don't give a damn either about me.
10przqa,,j6mzs0m,That's why you don't have kids, especially with shitty women.

10przqa,j6o0t0k,,You ate not homeless just because of child support. And if you are paying more than the state guidelines should have you pay, then file for an adjustment most of this can be done online without an attorney.  The CDL is a good idea....also if you are broke on 1 job then pick up a side gig doing something. Rent a room or rent a house and rent a room out.
10przqa,,j6qqz1n,Basic costs are so out of control now, I can definitely believe extra expenses like this causing homeleness.  It’s hard enough just to buy damn eggs. At least if you’re in the US!
10przqa,,j6qsdyk,I realize that but kids are a financial responsibility.  He would have to still help support the kids even if he was still with the mom
10przqa,,j6qua3q,Oh absolutely. He needs to pay for his kids, no matter what. I wish men didn’t see this as optional.  I’m just saying that everything is so expensive now, that almost any cost can push you over the edge.  In America, we’ve been taught since birth to be hyper independent. We’re even put in little cages, often in another room, as infants. But this hyper independent way of living doesn’t work anymore now everything is so expensive.   Now post-COVID we really need to live and work together to afford anything. We basically gotta instantly learn as adult to somehow live like they do in other countries. Learn to share the expenses for everything. Or at least learn to live like Hispanic and Indian people live in here in the US.   Unless you’re a huuuge earner, you either work and live as a team now, or you die.
10przqa,,j6qyyyd,I do not see this as optional. But imagine for a moment that 50% of your wages are garnished before you even see your paycheck. Ok.. so get a second job? They will garnish that as well. Get a higher paying job? The parent receiving child support gets to request an adjustment. Now you pay even more.  Fall behind? They fine you, then suspend your passport and drivers license, making it even harder to work. The child never sees the interest and fees that are applied.  I have never missed a payment. NOT ONE PAYMENT. I've missed work due to illness, injury, hurricanes, being laid off, and I've still managed to make every single payment. They still fuck up every so often due to computer glitches"" that cause me to have to miss work to go to the courthouse_ and ultimately pay some bogus fine that nobody there has any explanation for.  The child support system is no where near as straight forward as many would like to assume_ and generally speaking it is the father that gets continuously screwed over_ all while getting to see their children less and less.  &#x200B;  Yeah... it's fucked.",Vapur9,3,1,8,1024

j6luse2,In my car living days I had a squirrel that would come to where I parked and shared my trail mix with. Cool little dude. There's something nice about having an animal friend. It brings you peace and a connection. It's like_ here's something that doesn't care about how I look_ won't judge me_ just wants to hang out and eat peanuts.   It sucks that the dog isn't with you anymore but for the time you had together_ that dog was your buddy_ and you gave it your care and love. That's something few of us ever get enough of. Know that your dog friend got a lot of love from you_ that was a gift you gave it. You were able to show another creature compassion_ maybe the most they ever experienced_ and there's so many that just don't get any. You did a good thing. Keep making those connections_  keep showing love and compassion.,81Scales,6,1,3,1530
j6mwnzw,He thought you left him.,daxbr,6,3,3,1530
j6lsmne,I mean_ I get that you're going through a lot but your life story involves buying a house_ spending all your savings on Christmas gifts and weekly trips to a thrift store for clothes. People here don't rent or live with relatives_  they live in shelters or in tents or their cars. They're able to log in through free wifi they get at the library or the local Starbucks. Don't get me wrong_ it sounds like you're having a tough go_ but this may not be the right sub and frankly it's a little hurtful to make the comparison of what you're going through to homelessness.   That being said...  Your husband sounds like he may have budgeting issues as well some control issues. It sounds like he wants to make all the major decisions himself despite your significant contributions to the family. You two need to have a long and frank conversation about your financial goals and how you can achieve them. If he's not on board_ then_ as much as it would be difficult for the kids_ a divorce may be the best option. You are miserable and I'm sure your kids can feel the tension_ it's not healthy for them either. It is unfair to you and your kids to have your goals and your hard work to achieve those goals undermined and erased by your husband's poor decisions. Yes_ the housing situation is not ideal_ and I would say suck it up until you have enough saved...but you're not able to save_ so this goes from a temporary stint to a life imprisonment. Unless you can come to an agreement with your husband about the future of your family_ your SHARED goals_ and what each of you will do to reach them_ I would genuinely consider your options on making your goals achievable without him. It sucks. It's a crappy situation with no winners_ but unless an agreement can be made and stuck to_ it's going to get worse. Good luck and remember_ unfortunately_  some people can't change. If it doesn't work out_ it doesn't work out_ don't chain yourself to a life of misery out of good intentions.,81Scales,11,1,3,1530

j6lmzsr,This is a lot of unfortunate events to happen - I am really sorry to hear you are going through all of this. It is hard to think clearly and objectively when you are in the middle of so much aggravation. The fact that you and your husband do not agree on a way forward is a further complication.  Here are the issues_ I think_ as you laid out: 1) you are living in a very small house with people you do not get along with. The house is so small you and your husband cannot sleep in the same place. Your husband does not want to leave this house_ while you feel like you need to have your own space. To put it mildly_ the two of you are not on the same page on this.  2) money issues are rampant. You are currently trying to save money to be able to move out. Your husband gives his money to his parents_ which happened without him telling you. Again_ the two of you are on separate sides of the issue.  You did own a house for a while but decided to sell it and essentially lost the stake you had in it_ bringing your savings back to zero. This was a mistake on both your parts. We all make them. But hopefully you will learn something from that and be wiser in the future.  3) your stuff in a storage unit is another issue_ though one easily remedied. If you want to retrieve your clothes or other items you could do that yourself whether your husband wants you to or not. Bring some of your family members (father_ etc) and I am sure they will help you.   Honestly I think you should move out. You don't necessarily have to divorce your husband if you don't want to. Plenty of couples live apart for a time - think of military families_ for example. Move out_ retrieve your stuff_ keep your finances separate from your husband_ and let him figure his stuff out on his own. Either he will grow up and stand up for his family or he will stay tied to his parents. He may feel like he owes them or guilty for all of the problems at their house_ but at the end of the day he has to make a choice.  Part of your distress right now is that you are uncertain as to what you should do. Making up your mind as to a way forward will bring you some peace.,rtodd23,6,1,11,964
j6n6bae,I understand that you want to stay near family_ but you also say you can't afford to. You're going to have to make a choice. And frankly_ you don't need advice from the people on this forum.

j6n8jg4,Thankfully I had some supplies I could use already. But main thing was making sure I had a vehicle I could sleep in. Meaning working heat and room to hold stuff/lay down. For me its a minivan. I've got some thick foam mattress pads_ a sleeping bag_ and some blankets I use for a bed.   I have a cheap car plug in pot that will warm water (it's not strong enough to boil but it was only about $40). Ramen and some cheaper frozen pre-cooked meats (chicken nuggets aren't bad price per ounce) heat up fairly well. I'm in a cold climate so I don't have to get ice for my cooler as often either. And I do the gallon water refill at walmart every few days.   I have a gym membership which let's me shower_ and I bounce between a few truck stops for overnight parking and bathroom access.   I've only been homeless a bit over a week but I had less than 2 weeks to prepare. Thankfully I had some help getting started but all the shelters in my area are full and housing assistance has been backed up for years (this was a problem even pre-covid in most area). Also I was out of work at the time too. Thankful to be starting a job today acrually.  My biggest concerns are staying warm and hydrated. My biggest fears are not having money for gas (heat and electric) and being sent away from the truck stops. I just limit my usage as much as possible.

j6nhus0,"Homeostasis is a set of human states where both the body and the mind begin the healing process.  It will not begin in full until you are removed from the perturbations that cause you stress. The stresses caused by homelessness keep your body and mind in the state called fight-or-flight_ which doesn't allow for the type of healing that occurs within true homeostatic states.  This is why it is imperative to establish your new home as _safe space_. Safe space can become healing space if we keep it safe. After that_ if it becomes healing space_ the potential is there for it to become _sacred space_.  Sacred space is where we thrive. Survival is a victory_ but a human life can do far more than simply ""win"". A human has the potential to heal and heal other people.   But you can't get there if you betray the space_ and what that space can be. You must establish healthy boundaries with others so that your apartment can possess that power in your life. You must not trust others to stay with you if they don't have the same goal in mind for your apartment.   You have to believe in your ability to heal by yourself. You have to become a whole person by yourself first. You cannot help other people heal until you get there_ and you can't get there when you dread your own home.  Loneliness betrays us before people do. Trust is built over a long period of time. A home gives us the luxury of time_ because we can lock the door. So_ until someone proves that they are worthy to step foot into your home_ don't let them.   Instead_ make your home into a place that is a refuge from betrayal.",INFOborg,3,1,3,1530

I had a similar case where I had to leave situation after situation that living in my car feels like my own place to be safe and free. I'm to worried to leave my car alone too long also. I guess the best part about having your own place is shower_ laundry and a quiet peaceful place. Use that to your advantage and develop good habits. You will get good sleep and be clean and comfortable. I worry to much about owning furniture too beacuse I don't want to spend money on it if I'm just going to have to abandon it. If you do need furniture I would recommend goodwill or arc. They have lots of stuff that's usually cheep.

j6py0r0,"Oh boy_ that brought back some memories of my first apartment back into ""normal"" life. I had a folding chair and a TV tray that I would eat all my meals and use as my desk. I eventually saved and upgraded to a folding table.   Friend from work was dropping me off and came in to use my bathroom. The look he gave me. I didn't know this but he told everyone at work and these fuckers show up one night with furniture from their garages_ or spare bedrooms. A small comfy couch_ a table with two chairs_ and this little portable dvd player with a stack of DVDs that they let me borrow (didnt have a tv) and I learned that I could check out DVDs from the library. My supervisors wife gave me a bottle of shampoo because she heard I was using a bar of soap for everything. At first I was embarrassed as hell_ but these guys_ they made me feel real lucky.

If any of these are true they need to evict you first before you can be given the boot. You might be able to speak to someone in the system where you live to ask for resources. Call 211 and look online for resources in your area. Ousting someone with an 8yo child is something that shouldn't be allowed IMO. Hell I don't care if it's  a newborn_ as long as the child is legally not an adult and in school or unable to take care of itself a person shouldn't loose their housing.,Maverick_Wolfe,6,1,3,1530

j6kzfwt,I was a job corps residential advisor for about six months after I retired.   I think it is great resource for young people who are looking for a trade.     It may vary by location_ but the one I worked at was very strict towards the students. 10 pm lights off and strict quiet time on weekdays and midnight on weekends.   I can’t remember the time_ but it was a very early wake up with mandatory room clean up and common area assigned cleanup assignments which were inspected every morning by staff.  Time off the facility is restricted at first but eventually you will be able to go off the facility on weekends if you have a place to stay.   Any drinking or positive UAs gets a student removed.  I brought that up because I feel some are set up for failure because the recruiters don’t mention that and a lot of student get sent home_ whether they have a home or not.   So if anyone feels they can’t abide by rules_ which in someways were  stricter than when I was in the marines_ don’t bother going.  That being said_ all student who don’t have a high school diploma or GED will get that knocked out first.   Each job corps location offers multiple trades to train in and there may be a wait for the trade you selected.   While you wait they may put you in another trade with room.  Admin assistant was the trade most of the people went through while waiting.  My location had heavy equipment operation_ heavy equipment repair_ CDL_ electrician_ general construction_ some medical programs where the student went to the nearby community college_ and possibly carpentry and plumbing.  They do help student find a job.  I met several students who were homeless and they all seemed to do well.  The older students all seemed to do well also.   The sixteen and seventeen year olds seemed to have the least success in my opinion and caused a lot of problems for the other students because of the military like group punishment.     They should have had a separate dorm for them.   I would recommend attending.    Several students I personally new ended up making over a $100_000 a year once they had just a little work experience in the field.   Welding and heavy equipment student did really well working the pipelines.   A lot of electrician students ended up as union apprentices_ and the CDL students over 21 all had jobs waiting on them when they graduated.,JBinWyo,6,1,3,1530

j6htl6h,Are there any local agencies that will help you bridge the gap? It sounds as if things will be looking up very soon.  I’m not familiar with your area_ but generally the Salvation Army and other such organizations receive a great deal of federal money as well as money from utility companies to assist those behind on their bills. The caveat is that they may require a disconnection notice first.   If you don’t want t to go that route_ you can probably call or set up a payment plan online that will postpone your payment or break up any past due amount into payments spread over the next 3-6 months.  As for rent_ same deal. As a single person_ it’s harder to get assistance if any kind_ but call your local social services office and google “rent assistance” plus your zip code to try to find resources. Don’t give up!  As for getting your mental health on track_ if you don’t have a doctor or insurance_ contact your city’s community services board for a list of free or sliding-scale treatment options.  If you are really feeling hopeless_ call or text 988. It’s a confidential mental health crisis line and just having someone to talk things through with might go a long way toward making you feel like you can start to get a handle on this.   If you haven’t been eating well_ please update with your zip code. I’m sure there are food pantries and other resources to help get you through the next few weeks and people will be more than happy to help.  Again_ it sounds like you have a lot to look forward to. Don’t let depression lie to you and convince you there’s no way out except homelessness. As you well know_ that’s trading a temporary set of problems for a crisis that can be extremely difficult to come back from.   ***mom hug***,WhatFreshHello,3,1,3,1530

j6h9izd,Consider [Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)  The base layer **Physiological** needs include many things that can be difficult for homeless people to attain:  Heat_ clothes_ hygiene_ food_ shelter_ and sleep to name a few.  The second tier is **Safety**. Basically everything in this tier is difficult for homeless folks to maintain:  Health_ personal security_ emotional security_ financial security.  Third tier is **Love and Social Belonging**_ and in most cultures homeless fall into their situation thru the lack of social safety net_ and our culture actively ostracizes and shuns them.  Family_ friends_ intimacy_ trust_ acceptance_ and giving and receiving love and affection.  **Esteem** is the fourth tier_ and includes both self esteem and the esteem of others - how much you are respected as an individual. Also a difficult thing for homeless people to acquire.  The tiers above involve these four are about mental enrichment and (surprise surprise) are also going to be difficult for homeless to achieve.  But the idea of the hierarchy is that you need to build from each tier_ and that someone who can’t reliably acquire food won’t have the ability to really prioritize their safety. Someone who feels unsafe won’t be able to find stable love and social bonds. A person who can’t form love or social bonds won’t be able to cultivate esteem.  So on and so forth.  Basically homeless people are fucked when it comes to achieving happiness. Every disadvantage is weighing them down_ and it is a failure of our society and our ability to empathize that we continue to allow it to happen. People who can survive being homeless have suffered extreme mental distress_ and have tested the bounds of what humans can endure.  For me personally the third and fourth tiers were the stumbling block_ and even though I had the privilege of the first two tiers being OK_ I wasn’t able to resolve the third and fourth until I was no longer homeless.,Warp-n-weft,7,1,3,1530
j6h51hg,Well for starters not having a safe comfortable stable place to sleep will affect your sleep and you may start to hallucinate. Also_ this may be the case if you can’t find food as well other people in society treat you a certain way_ and soon you may start to believe it and doubt yourself being exposed to the elements constantly will affect your physical health_ which will intern affect your mental health.,triplesensei,5,1,3,1530

We got into our own place in 2021. We have a beautiful 3 bedroom apartment. The first thing I do is pay the rent thats the first thing I do. We got all our furniture from our local buy nothing and everything is free groups. I told them we just got out of a shelter and had no car and they dropped off all our furniture and we got towels_ kitchen items_ everything we needed. If you can get a referral from the group that helped you they need to send an email and you can go to a furniture bank and pick out everything you need. Also if anything ever happens again God forbid_ knock wood. This group in nevada helps with crates and free vet care and if you go on their website you can find free pet food donation sites and lots of resources. Keep it on hand.

For example_ those experiencing homelessness in colder climates may have to contend with freezing temperatures_ snow_ and ice_ while those in warmer climates may have to deal with extreme heat and dehydration.  n terms of shelter_ people in cold climates may need to find ways to stay warm_ such as seeking out heated buildings_ using blankets or sleeping bags_ or building makeshift shelters. In warmer climates_ shade and access to water may be more important.   As for food_ people experiencing homelessness may have to rely on food banks_ soup kitchens_ or other resources to get their meals. In colder climates_ finding hot meals may be particularly important_ while in warmer climates_ access to refrigeration or cool storage may be more of a concern.   Overall_ it's important to remember that homelessness is a complex issue with many different factors at play. It's great that you're trying to better understand the experiences of those facing homelessness in different climates.,anufriievvitalii,2,1,3,1530

j6i0qd7,For anyone applying for SSI/SSDI benefits_ there is an expedited review and approval process for individuals experiencing homelessness called SOAR.  It requires a case manager with specific training and certification in the program to oversee your case and submit a narrative_ but it can expedite the process to as little as 8 weeks. Many community service boards and some agencies coordinating support for homeless individuals_ particularly veterans_ have someone on staff to handle this. It’s extremely thorough in collecting required documentation_ so approval rates are in the 70-80% range.

If you're cleanish_ it's easy enough to get by. There are 4 or 5 meal programs within 3 miles of me. All open during weekday mornings.   Also getting around to get your needs taken care of is doable. The bus system has light / no security. You can hop on and hop off and noone will say anything. Lots of locals included in that unspoken system   It's not easier though. 8/10 people are just stuck up. People don't talk to me because they believe I'm a hiding drug addict and they have trust issues_ so they'd never believe the truth coming from me.  They are actually more likely to help the half naked shit covered crackheads outside. Those being the few people that *need* to be in inpatient care.

j788bgq,I think the problem is you give details people don’t or won’t understand.  I think we all do this_ especially when we really need help_ and are so traumatized we don’t know which details matter  The irony is that if you leave some details out (lie by omission)_ then people wouldn’t call you a liar.   You may be too traumatized to be able to share this with a judge mental audience. (I’m sort of experiencing the same things tbh. I have to leave things out so people believe me — but I don’t always know what to leave out eek)  Are you able to get Medicaid so you can see a therapist trained in trauma? That’s what I’d recommend.  If youre at 0 or near zero_ call Medicaid and tell them on the PHONE. They should approve you immediately. Do it before the pandemic status wears off. It’s easier now but it won’t be in a couple months  Just do this then get a psych.

A little different as we had made agreements as too the logistics of our divorce which she then threw away because I had the audacity to enforce my boundaries.   After I few days I was able to sit down and take a hard look at my financials and realize that if I wanted to afford therapy and some medical care of been putting off_ I couldn't afford housing and the expected support order. And payoff the debt from the marriage. Decided a career change was in order.   Found a company that would house me during CDL training_ then I could live in the truck while working. Been doing that since May_ I'm getting a significant pay raise starting this Monday (500+ a week) which will accelerate my debt payoff.

j68zdf9,It is my belief that what you said you changed is the actual reason why 12 Step programs like AA help a lot of people. It gives hope to others and ourselves. Its not the spirituality or anything else. It is people helping each other get better. It is holding onto each others bootstraps.                I have horrible PTSD and this is inspiring to me. Homelessness made me bitter and so mistrusting_ perhaps I need to help others just to help them. The worst fear and sense of desperation I have is that I won't ever be able to connect with people again the way I did before homelessness.  The selfishness during Covid kinda cemented that I was right in the feelings homelessness inspired. Half the country supported a President that made fun of disabled people in his campaign and refused to wear a cloth on their face to help protect fellow human beings while simultaneously waiting flags and proclaiming their Patriot towards the country and support of troops. Patriotic people join the military and pledge to give their lives (albeit mostly for bullshit propaganda) but a cloth mask was too much inconvenience.

They have an answering machine for when they aren't in the office_ so if you get that_ make sure to leave a message_ they will call you back.  They're all over the US_ it's part of Catholic Charities_ and you don't have to be Catholic to get help. They also paid for my heart medications and gave me a 25 dollar Publix card to get food while in the motel. I'm not even religious_ but I can't say enough good things about them_ at least in the 2 states I've had to use them until I could get back on my feet and find a way out of being homeless. I am disabled and at the time_ was in a partial body cast from major spine surgery.

j67itkn,Regardless_ she should still call 911_ Fish and Game_ or the Forest Service. They most likely aren't going to care about her being homeless_ they're going to see it as a survival situation. Whether OP's homeless or not. Their imperative is to ensure her survival and safety by getting her out of there. Abandoned is stranded_ and it doesn't matter if its in a remote area_ or a popular campground; it's ultimately the concern of whoever's in charge of the area. Nobody wants the land they're managing to be the place where someone got hurt or died. Whether it's by sketchy people or otherwise. That's terrible for everyone (especially for those working there).   I'm saying this as someone whose father worked in wildlife and fisheries. They're usually pretty understanding of people's situation_ and it's common for them to help people out. As there's emergency situations that happen all the time in the outdoors. They might even be able to drive her to wherever she needs to go. I'd say it's OP's best bet. This probably isn't even the first time they've had to help someone who was abandoned in the woods.,FreakyFunTrashpanda,4,2,3,1530

We hadn't even been there the day it happened but an RV was boondocking for a couple weeks and our vehicle just got tagged in a handful of repeat visitors that got the same nonsense.

Things are definitely changing though. Especially in Salt Lake. Provo on the other hand_ is the Mormon mecca... The biggest problem however_ was when they shut down the biggest shelter there was out there in downtown to make room for new apartments and the money invested in ""cleaning it up"".

OK_ give the local Lazarus Project a call (on Monday) to see what requirements are needed to access transitional housing and temporary (shelter) housing  (916) 772-6833. It SHOULD NOT be a requirement to access any shelter because they get money from the state and federal government to operate.  Ask them what your options are but I'll be damned if they say you need to get an ID with a city on it because you HAVE NO ADDRESS...THAT'S THE WHOLE GODDAMN POINT OF THE SHELTER!

They'll ask you to leave if you use drugs/alcohol on campus or leave trash or harass other students_ but otherwise it should be chill. They might be able to get you a free or very cheap parking pass. Check out their website_ but you'll have to wait until Monday to call. https://www.sierracollege.edu/student-services/health-and-wellbeing/basic-needs-resources/  EDIT- yes_ they help students first but it takes nothing to become a ""student"" there's plenty of ""classes"" that are free and online and don't really require much from you BUT you may want to check out classes because as of this year tuition is free if you qualify financially and you definitely would qualify_ you just probably need to see a counselor but be patient and know that this is what the community College system was meant for_ it is a resource for those who need help_ those who want to improve their lives.

j66tqxr,The best approach would be to divide the homeless into demographic groups and case workers and volunteer legal students help each demographic separately. For example homeless people with probable psychosis or apparent schizophrenia could be rounded up and taken to a mental hospital where social workers could help them apply for disability benefits. Homeless people who are undocumented aliens with no work papers and no legal rights to be in the country could be rounded up and introduced to law students whereupon they could be given assistance applying for an O visa. Homeless people with addiction problems could be transported to rehab/detox facilities. Situationally homeless people with no drug addiction and no apparent psychosis could be set up with an appointment at the employment center and offered a free bus ticket to get there. Jailbird recidivists on a revolving door to the correctional system probably are too difficult to help at all_ sociopathy isn’t considered curable. Some people can’t be helped.

j65h5ua,I don’t know anything about Australia or what resources might be available but heavily seconding the person who mentioned youth shelters if you have access to one or can get to an area that has one. They’re a heck of a lot better than the more general adult shelters- though all the advice about stealing and guarding your phone largely remains true. Would say it was better overall but don’t be stupid. And on the youth shelter front_ also don’t be stupid and do things other teens in the shelter might be trying to pull you along for that could get you kicked out- I saw quite a bit of that the two times I was in youth shelters. I think the peer pressure and just everyone wanting to have friends stuff is a lot harder when you’re younger. I’d look the other way_ not snitch_ and try to get along but at some point never forget to look out for you and you alone.   Youth shelter is probably the best that can happen for you. Conversely I’d keep an eye out for other young folks on the streets if that doesn’t pan out because you’re probably safer with folks your age.,Tzipity,2,1,3,1530

j631l5h,I spent 6 months homeless in the back of a truck moving to different campsites every 2 weeks in Escondido_ CA. It really didn't feel like being homeless. I had a safe spot to go to every night where I was allowed to be and a spot to shower and do basic grooming. I eventually got a tent and picked up a mattress that someone had tossed on the side of the freeway_ and at that point i damn near felt like I had an actual home to sleep in.   Back then the campsites were about $12-$15 a night_ so it wasn't that much cheaper than renting a room_ but I couldn't find someone to rent a room to me_ so camping was the best alternative I could find.  I tried to save money by parking in parking lots or residential areas but usually a cop would come and knock on my window and tell me to leave. I wound up being so anxious about it that I couldn't get any sleep. Having a spot were I was allowed to be made all the difference.,HowDidIFallForThis,3,1,8,1024
j63d94p,I would be applying for income based housing. Also section 8 public housing is income based. I’m in Minnesota not cali so I’m betting it’s quite different there.

I’m in a bad situation and I hate mn. If you’re disabled you can apply for housing just for disabled persons. The rental apps at least for Minnesota are pretty much useless. Its web based searches and posting on local groups like Facebook asking for information on income based housing places. Don’t be scared of waiting lists_ typically a waitlist is 75% void because once they open apartments and start calling people on the list_ wrong number_ unreachable_ already found a place etc. put your name on every list you can and keep a notebook of which places you applied with the name address and phone number and the date you applied.

j61t28h,$3000 isn't likely to get you a very reliable van these days. Unfortunately_ buying vans and spending ridiculous money to make them into little houses is a current fad for the American middle class. In a couple years_ when the fad is over_ there's going to be a glut of van conversions on the market and probably some really good deals_ but right now it's hard to find anything that even runs for under $5000.  Of course_ anything at all you can sleep in is going to be great for you pretty soon since the hotels will suck you dry. Is there any way you could make your current car better for sleeping in_ though? Take out the backseat_ put in blackout curtains_ things like that. It's possibly a better option than a low cost van.  As for finding a real roof_ have you tried looking at shared houses/rooms for rent? That's not just for college kids anymore and actually there's some real nice places available.

j63nuqf,I’ve been homeless in your area since Oct. I was having the same problems but things are getting better and I’ve been learning. I’m so close to being out of homelessness. Here’s what I’ll say:  Not everyone is cut out to live in a car. I can sleep anywhere. My sister_ not so much. I had to take her to the hospital for blood flow issues. Unless you plan on investing in a really REALLY good mattress make sure you’re actually capable of sleeping there. My sister went about 3 months until I literally had to take her to the hospital every night. It was terrible and I literally had to hear her cry herself to sleep every night_ and we ended up camping in the mud regardless because otherwise we wouldn’t sleep.  Assuming you’re not superhuman like me and capable of sleeping in a car indefinitely:  Look for rooms for rent that are being sublet. There’s Craigslist_ and also cheap places near colleges. Students usually have parents that have good credit scores if you need a guarantor_ just pay the other half of the rent. Put an ad on paper at the local colleges nearby. Plus there are plenty of female only college situations where you’ll feel safe_ and the parents would probably feel safer that you’re female. Not all college students party. Some are older_ some are more studious and quiet. You can even live really cheaply if there more people.  Otherwise_ look into a guarantor service_ which is a service that helps you qualify for housing BUT you take the fall if you fuck up.  Also look into renting an office and secretly living in it_ just say you’re making a start up and working 24/7 is an option. Get a gym membership for showering.  Just make sure to take care of your health. Plus if you lose the car that’s losing your home. At least with a room or place you can rely on busing or rent a car if you’re desperate.  UberEats and Doordash have literally saved my life_ but also I’m currently switching to a job in sales/life insurance. I’m just studying for my license exam atm. Look for sales jobs that are remote_ where you don’t need to find leads_ and where it’s commission based because there’s no cap on what you can make. You’ll be much happier with a job where there’s no cap on the money_ and you have an opportunity to make as much as you want.  I can even talk to the people I’m with. Maybe I can give you a link to send your resume too?  I’ve heard great things about the solar industry too!  Also_ if you’re food insecure or have trouble cooking_ multivitamins on top of EBT and food bank stuff can help you not get sick. Eating junk food and food that isn’t cooked everyday will kill you! Get free big waters from Starbucks and don’t pay for it! Drink water and get nutrients every day!  EDIT: me and my sister are both trans. Feel free to dm us since we know services you will qualify for! You shouldn’t have to pay for hotels!!,Agreeable-Let-1474,1,1,3,1530

j65irly,Oh this is an interesting point I hadn’t considered. I’m in a very complex medical situation really fucking me around and eh the only person to argue with me was my jackass younger brother who was adamant I wasn’t “really homeless” because I was in a shitty hotel. Dude was dealing with his own shit and clearly some messy effed up family dynamics but I admit that I might have gotten more help sooner but was confused myself by whether I “actually counted” as I was losing my housing and had a friend covering a nicer hotel for a bit.   I definitely see how others might be thinking “eh I have a place no matter how shady and questionable to rest my head for the time being. Don’t think I’ll go try and get serviced because others need it more”. I have noticed some places are better than others at actually describing their definition of who they help or what they consider “homeless” but on its face_ yeah. I also think there’s a lack of awareness of how many of us are in these super tenuous situations but not out and out on a piece of cardboard on the street.,Tzipity,1,1,3,1530
j62p4sf,Because being homeless is not great. When you really think of a person's circumstances when homeless_ it is awful.

j60mlor,">sounds pretentious and overall unproductive. It's not like it changes    people's views on homeless people or helps homeless people.  Truth.  It's like the descriptor_ ""ladies of the night.""  Calling people who are forced to sell access to their bodies for sex ""ladies of the night"" rather than prostitutes (or 'who\*res') doesn't make their lives any easier or get at solving the problem.  It's just another meaningless tiny pushback that the system permits in order to give the appearance that it's open to changing without ever needing to do so.  The idea behind it is that calling someone 'homeless' makes that individual's lack of housing the only pertinent thing about them.  Similar to how describing someone as a junkie defines them by their relationship to drugs and ignores everything else about them.  To illustrate the difference_ the actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) was a junkie and died of it_ but people still treated him like a person_ because was also a successful actor.  He would have described as 'an actor with a drug problem' instead of a druggie.    So for homelessness_ saying_ this or that person is 'unhoused' or 'experiencing homelessness' implies two important things.  One that their lack of home is merely one of many things that make them who they are_ and secondly that that condition is temporary_ rather than defining.",SecularMisanthropist,3,1,3,1530

And today was the very last day though supposedly they’d gotten an extension for me so I don’t know. I got mislead and screwed around.   Damn it. The address thing but also the fact that I’m in one state but the housing thing was in another left me not sure what to do. Thanks though. I’ve been wondering if half my problem is not speaking up or saying more sooner. Because I feel like if I had learned this even yesterday… everything would be different.,Tzipity,1,2,3,1530

It's just too expensive and the shortage means that landlords are only accepting the cream of the crop of renters. I am actually from Denver_ born and raised_ so I'll tell you that you do not want to be homeless there. Not only is it horrifically cold_ it's unsafe.

j65oec5,Learned these lessons the hard way just yesterday myself and wish I’d seen this post then. I’m not roughening it outside (thankfully because with my medical situation I’d be dead quick no matter what) but had to be out and about on a wild goose chase for what I’d hoped was going to be a housing opportunity in shitty boots in the Midwestern snow storm. Fucked up and had on some mystery synthetic blend compression socks with wool socks over those. Seems I should’ve reversed that. Saw the wool moisture wicking in action but my boots kept sporadically releasing water through the soles and while the wool kept out a lot everytime it seeped through to the compression socks it was miserable.   I spent some time in a public bathroom with the hand dryer and my shoes and socks trying to dry out and warm things up but fuck_ if only I had known to layer those socks in the reverse direction it would’ve saved a lot of hardship. (Though sharing this now because in an emergency if you can get to a hand dryer some place it works. Though learn from me- Dry out then research/ learn how to layer up better!). God I was doing the same thing with two hats. Thin cotton hat on my head with a wool knit with fleece around the ears hat over top. Will say wool on the outside sort of does best a cotton topper though. Made it take s lot longer for moisture from the outside to come in. Just was trapping any body based moisture against me. Maybe keep your cotton between two wool layers then.,Tzipity,1,1,3,1530
j68xdmh,Use plastic bags over the inside layer of socks as it keeps the feet warm even though wet. Also_ you can use torn off sections of an emergency blanket or large chip packets with reflective foil insides to put over your socks to radiate heat back.  However_ you do need to get boots off otherwise creates problems and having a dry pair of socks to put on to sleep in helps enormously. Wet boots aren't a problem if you use plastic bags_ you just need to dry socks then.  The 'hothands' things work too if you have money enough to get them to keep toes warm.  If you're in Midwest still its getting real cold again tonight +wind_ if you don't have face cover and do have a spare base layer_ preferably merino_ fold the body into three or so and use the arms to tie it behind your head...that way you cover face/ neck and with hat pulled down just leave the eyes exposed.,helpsaveme2020,1,2,3,1530
j5zl870,Came here just to say this. Cotton is great in the summer because it's light and breathable_ but it does not wick moisture! Probably fine to wear as an outer layer_ but definitely not right against your skin.   If you want something that isn't wool for your base layer there are moisture wicking synthetics. Linen is also good at wicking moisture_ but I imagine hard to find_ and it isn't all that warm.,murder-waffle,2,1,3,1530

He's very nice and comes in every day to sit in our cafe and warm his hands with our hot water. I recall my managers talking about him horribly in front of me_ totally unaware of my situation. Just brutally making fun of the man as if he's disturbing them whenever he comes in and it really bothered me. I think some people are just privileged enough within their lives to not have to understand something like this. Doesn't make it ok whatsoever but I think people assume that animals are more deserving than people because in their minds people can avoid something like homelessness.

j5yhplm,Well most people who do animal rescue do not spend as much money out of pocket for the animals care as you may think. Most of the time we provide the shots and all vetting ourselves. They’re fixed for free. Unless an animal is extremely ill we don’t see a vet because there’s no need most of the time_ we have treatments on hand.  Rescues partner with vets who offer veterinary service at no cost or low cost for sick animals_ most rescues get large donations for vet care frequently aswell. Just about everyone I’ve met in animal rescue isn’t well off at all so kinda have to pick and choose where to put all you’ve got.

Humans scam_ threaten_ and frankly_ are visually unappealing in most cases. Its not widely talked about but people will feel more threatened by a homeless man compared to an aggressive dog because ironically_ at the end of the day homeless are humans. This means that people tend to not perceive them as beings needing help but rather potential adversary possessing similar intelligence and capabilities as themselves seeking to take resources from them.

He rolled his window down to ask if I was ok and asked if I needed a jacket. His concern was genuine and very touching.   OP thanks for posting this_ we hear so many stories of negative encounters with the police it’s nice to hear people’s positive stories.,MrsDirtbag,6,1,3,1530
j5xf9p8,"Me and my boyfriend and fallen asleep in our usual place outside a library and a cop came up around 6:30 am and woke us. He asked us to move and his reasoning was ""I don't want to see you get in trouble if someone calls us to make you move. You're safe to sleep here at night but once people start moving about around 6 it would be best for you to move.""",emotional_waffle_bee,3,1,3,1530
j5xqvtt,In my experience_ majority are_ when treated right. Had more than one cop save my bacon (pun intended.)  The bad one's mostly few. Law enforcement can definitely attract some twisted types too. Gives a lot of authority over other people.   Can immediately recall 3 times police officers did something amazing to help me out and cut me big-time breaks. Am certain I'm forgetting more times.,Maleficent_Ant6035,4,1,3,1530
j5y7c65,I was saved by police 24 years ago by an ex who stabbed me 25x with a screwdriver. They heard me screaming and tried to kick door in when that didnt work they rang the bell the loser went to answer it and immediately got cuffed and put in car. I had many many police_ firefighters and ambulence people in my house helping me. Also my dad and uncles were police back then and were very kind. They also helped me 4 years ago when ex husband punched me in the face again when I was leaving. Thats how we ended up in shelter. They bought us food and took us to hotel until we could get in shelter. I thank God for them. ❤️,krissyskayla1018,3,1,3,1530

The workers at this store I guess are allowing these 2 guys to sit inside and get out of the cold for now. I like good cops not bad cops.,Desperate-Long359,2,1,3,1530

j619wez,I have a tazer_ it's rechargeable and looks like a flashlight.   Since it looks like a flashlight_ it tends to be mostly non-threatening until I want it to be. Turning it on is loud and threatening_ so it's a good deterrent. On top of that I'm confident in my ability to use it_ and have experience getting tazed.

j67870c,I have no judgment for anybody who decides that they have to have something to protect themselves on the street.  The first thought that comes to my mind is that I would just try to avoid everybody_ but the truth is that that's not always possible.  The number one law of the street_ from what my clients tell me_ is that most conflicts are resolved with a physical confrontation or intimidation. So if you're behind a business building_ and no one else can see_ and it comes down to you and one other individual... It's not always easy to know what traumatized people are going to do.  Surviving violence while you are homeless is a skill. I don't think anybody who has a place to live really is equipped to pass any sort of authentic judgment about it.,INFOborg,1,1,3,1530
j5xfnr2,Understood.  Trust is very hard to have when you’ve been betrayed by people and just about every other event in your life.  Trusting- means being vulnerable. Vulnerable means you can lose anything and everything at any time_ but that’s where the folly is- fear. It’s almost like fear of doom becomes self fulfilling.  Maybe live with a healthy fear of danger_ but let go of fear that you have no control over.  I guess this applies to me and anyone else that can identify.,Mean-Copy,14,1,12,1488

j5xit9p,> The hardest part is establishing anything stable enough to believe that homelessness isn't right around the corner again_ including the mental aspect.  It took me quite a while to adjust to that feeling_ after my ex and I finally got off the street and moved into our own place. Like_ it didn't feel like *home*_ and I couldn't really relax without feeling like the whole thing would turn out to be a dream or something.  It's also been touch-and-go the last couple of years_ feeling like I wasn't headed straight back there_ and kind of resigning myself to that instead of trying to do everything I could to prevent that.,Vyzantinist,7,1,9,1231

j5wzfin,Being despised by practically everyone for being homeless. There were kind people but it was 90% abuse day in and day out for over 5 years. In the early days I had several people really take advantage of my situation_ work me nearly to death and treat me like utter crap.   One woman she worked me 10+ hours 7 days a week in return for sleeping upstairs on a couch in a room filled with construction supplies. I was supposed to have a much better deal but she didn't care. She basically turned me into her personal slave for 3 months until I could find a way out. The people I left her house for weren't much better.   During the time I was homeless I was spat at_ insulted multiple times daily_ had people outright hate crime me more than once and I had guys constantly trying to prostitute me. I was very lucky I survived it not being raped or worse.   The indignity of it all_ being treated like you are subhuman. That's the worst of it for me. I'm housed 18 months now but I still get stuck in the homeless mindset sometimes feeling like everyone I meet just can't be trusted. I'm still very anxious when it comes to anything that could seemingly jeapordize my housing.   I'm no longer physically homeless but in my head part of me still is and might always be. It just lasted too damn long the whole experience. It's marked me for life in a way. I can't walk down the street in NYC and see homeless people and just take it for granted that I'm not.   I actually SEE them_ as real people suffering and I know that suffering so it's not easy just walking by. I've fed people_ given away clothes and stuff.   I still don't have a lot. I'm living on SS disability but I'm still paying it forward for the good people that did help me. No matter how poor I might feel I know there are people worse off than I am. I try to help a couple of people a month in one way or another even if it's only buying somebody a $4 McDonald's meal deal or a slice of cheese pizza once a month when I get my direct deposit.   The indignity of being homeless that's the absolute worst. Even if you get out you're always looking back and thinking about the cruel stuff that people inflicted upon you. You're always double checking yourself making sure that you're no longer looking or acting homeless. You go out of your way to behave extra normal in a way so that nobody would ever guess you once were yourself.   This is why I'm so honest about having been and openly talk about it_ about living on the streets and in shelters. The stigma is still a big thing and non homeless people need to truly understand the experience so they understand why treating homeless people that way is very damaging.   I think it took me a good year of being housed to stop expecting verbal abuse from people. To feel even vaguely normal again. Being homeless it's like you're a scapegoat and an outcast. It's not an easy mindset to let go of.,mtempissmith,48,1,9,1231
j5yln9w,I’ve been couch surfing with my son (he’s 32) since my mom passed. Since we lost our house in order for her to be able to live in an assisted living facility_ I have been so mindful of the homeless people that I see on the street daily. I try to help when I can_ but usually I just talk to them. I doubt anyone even sees them(instead of just looking through them). I have the utmost respect for these people_ now that I have been in a similar situation. I haven’t had to sleep on concrete yet_ but at least I have opened my eyes to the plight of these folks and feel blessed that I’m not quite there. I guess what I’m trying to say without sounding condescending is that I am finally understanding and not judging. All people need to be understood and nurtured.,Dek63,4,1,3,1530

j672fiy,I find myself mostly sticking to this sub because you don’t have to look far even online to hear all this shit. I’ve repeatedly stumbled on heavy “bootstraps mentality” over in the poverty finance sub_ for example. Makes me want to just scream “If it’s so damn easy to make money and turn your life around why are you subbed here?”   My favorite about the “nobody has the right to live” types is how heavily the crossover is between them and the sorts outlawing abortion because a fucking zygote has some sort of “right to life” until they’re actually born apparently. Or the people who keep trying to take my cat away from me or reported me when I inferred I would off the cat and myself. They didn’t report or care about me killing myself. Just the cat. And I’m sorry but I don’t believe a high needs elderly cat who’s spent her entire existence basically on top of me (developed severe disabilities shortly after adopting her so we have always been together) is going to do too well without the single human she loves and trusts. But animals and fetuses apparently have rights no one extends to their fellow humans.,Tzipity,1,3,3,1530

I also now hate peanut butter & hardly ever drink water since it was such a pain in the ass to get in my old living situation.   Sidenote:          One time me and my fiance passed a  fellow homeless friend on the side of the road & he had just copped a BUNCH of snacks (mostly sweets & chocolate milk)           I just remember I hadn't eaten for like 3      days when we saw him.

I'm the same person_ who showers roughly as much as before and wears the same clothes_ but it's like I turned into a grubby_ scraggly_ drunk_ grizzled gold-prospector-type bugging them for a dollar rather than the person am_ standing in front of them right now.,heyitscory,14,1,11,964

I can't even claim them stolen due to needing them (using click to pay when I can) because that's the only money I have despite it being a few dollars and no address to get new cards sent to (my bank is out of state). So now it takes me longer to do anything unlocking and relocking them again. Just sucks being so disorganized that I can lose/have things stolen so easily.

Otherwise_ food wasn't an issue because the suburban area I lived in had like 4 or 5 grocery stores within walking distance; I carried everything I owned in a military-sized/style backpack (a co-worker offered to take care of my roll-on luggage containing other stuff) and work was a relatively quick walk from where I 'lived'.

j5wiykm,Ooo great question I was homeless with my sibling for a year and a half and throughout my homelessness I had a lot of random people shout at me to just get a job while I was trying to fly a sign to ask for money for food that day.  I was homeless in a lot of different situations_ homelessness for everyone looks different. For me I was sleeping on concrete_ I have also slept in shelters_ in hotels and I had my own tent/campsite near some homeless resources. People assume that homelessness is often a result of laziness or drug abuse.   I was homeless with my sibling because we were born from an extremely abusive family_ from about the age of 15_ we were living with different people…in and out of homes_ so we didn’t experience a stable living situation for most of our adolescence.  Neither of us abuse drugs_ and we are actually extremely motivated people however_ given our abusive childhood_ we did struggle from mental issues and also I have a physical disability (Scoliosis). So given things like physical pain and mental issues_ such as PTSD that makes it harder to work for even a normal person.    When I was homeless_ I struggled to eat sufficient meals. Sometimes I also struggled to find a place to wash myself properly_ and I stunk a lot of the time. During the time that I slept on concrete_ I didn’t sleep much at all and I started getting very intense sleep deprivation issues. I believe in order to work a job you need basic human necessities_ such as a place to bathe_ place to sleep and food. Now these are things that you can get from living in a shelter but often times people in shelters have to be kicked out in 30 days because it’s temporary housing. You could also be in a shelter with a lot of other people and again you’re not sleeping well_ maybe you’re not eating well and maybe the environment as a whole could be triggering for you.   Both of my shelter experiences were very triggering because I was born from an awful family that also abused drugs_ so seeing people in the shelter abusing drugs_ and talking about it was not a comfortable place for me. Both times I lived in shelters I got sick a lot and I was harassed by men in the shelter as well.   One thing that is so important to understand is that most homeless people especially those in brutal homeless situations are just trying to figure out how to survive. They are thinking about what they are going to eat next and where they are going to sleep for the night. Being in that state of mind is survival mode. You cannot focus on any other task but surviving_ so a job is not important at all. Jobs are for people who have basic human necessities or rather_ I should say basic human rights. A lot of people don’t realize that when you apply for a job_ you need to put down an address to receive mail at & some people don’t even have an address that they can get mail at.   Another note is that a lot of jobs don’t pay you enough to even afford housing_ especially in very populated areas housing is extremely expensive. Going and getting a job at say Walmart or maybe a fast food chain is not going to be able to support your rent. Even people who aren’t homeless and are working jobs are struggling to pay their rent. Minimum wage jobs require 40 hours a week at least to be able to begin to afford a place. And to do so it would take a few months of saving money. I’m talking about minimum wage jobs because they’re are the most accessible and don’t require many skills. If you’re going to get a job that’s higher paying they’re likely going to deny your application if you do not have a place to live. Another huge factor of working is literally getting to work. Transportation like buses in a lot of cities can be expensive or simply does not exist. Riding a bike can also be very difficult to do if you have a physical issue or your work is very far away.  (I was only 19 years old when I became homeless and I’m almost 21 now and I still don’t have a job due to my PTSD and spinal pain. My housing isn’t stable either. I’m currently trying to get SSI income and it feels impossible. Takes forever. If I am approved it’s only $900 a month that’s still not enough for housing where I live.)

j5qdmbd,It's hard to give definite advice without knowing what kind of irritation you're talking about exactly_ but my first thought is that the wipes you're using could be the issue. Especially if they're alcohol based (but even if they're not)_ they will mess with the normal_ healthy bacterial community on your skin and essentially select for more aggressive species and strains_ which could develop into an infection of something like Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas. Wipes will also just make the seasonal dry skin of winter even worse_ which causes irritation_ too. Either (or both) of these can lead to an immune reaction like eczema or psoriasis.  Try switching to a different type of wipes and use them less. I find that the best way to stay clean without showering_ at least in the winter_ is to wear a base layer of good long johns and an undershirt and wash them as often as I need to. Go to a laundrymat that has a sink and handwash then put them in the drier.,AdeepinAmerica,2,1,3,1530

j5rekoi,Ok bro I think I understand better now. Go to Walmart in the camp section grab a collapsible bucket and a 100% cotton bandana and a cup. You're going to get FAST at this trust me. So fill your bucket with water as hot as possible and go into a stall. Fill your cup with water and throw your bandana in it and crinkle it up scrub your whole body with the cup of water no soap just get wet. Dump the cup into the toilet grab more water in your cup and rinse your bandana off then dump it. Now soap and scrub all your skin with the cup. Now you need to get the soap off use the cup to keep your clean water clean and rinse yourself off with the bandana. The last step is the most important_ wait for a minute and press and rub your skin with your fingers and palms. if it's to wet this won't work just give it a little longer. The damp skin will literally roll off you. I don't recommend doing this to often it can be ruff on fresh skin. Just as needed. And you can use the bucket to was normally in between.,z_thefree,2,2,3,1530

j5vfht7,One of Portland biggest issues is drug use. They keep trying to crack down on it_ but they're doing a shit job. Arresting people doesn't make an opiate epidemic magically dissappear. We desperately need better mental health services_ both addiction related and otherwise.   We would also benefit from education for police/local officials/other people with power as to what actually gets people off drugs (which is helping them fix their life and get stable before trying to get them sober_ instead of forcing them to detox in a facility/prison before dumping them back on the streets you found them on).  As for non drug related things_ winters here have been becoming increasingly severe in a way they have never been before. This means there aren't many existing resources the can help people when its starting to get cold. Not just shelters but assistance with supplies (hand warmers_ dry socks_ tarps_ raincoats_ close toed shoes). We also need more places that can provide a warm meal.,Heart-Of-Aces,2,2,3,1530

They explained to me sober living isnt treament focused_ its just about agreeing to live drug free while in the home to support a wellness enviroment.   They are wonderful resources for anyone who is homeless. They usually have a couple of people stay in each bedroom_ but it makes the rent super affordable.

You could look for a cheap weekly airbnb deal... or if you live somewhere with fair weather_ you could buy a large comfortable tent and rent a campsite in a campground for a couple of months with that money. They have restrooms_ showers_ laundry_ etc.  Homeless shelters for women and children are rather decent. You usually either get your own room_ or share a room with a couple other ppl_ and it's relatively safe.  Homeless shelters for men are pretty awful. You can often expect to share a single room with 50 or more people. Most of them are pretty dangerous and your things go missing.

j5k7hsq,To be clear_ I’m homeless_ overworked and miserable and nearly freezing to death most nights trying to get myself and my family somewhere to live. If you want to talk about misery_ I can do that. I just don’t see the point. If I didn’t have a family to support_ I could easily be homeless and happy. But I have to see the abject misery on my wife’s face because she got rejected_ just like me_ to the last 20 jobs she applied to_ while struggling to do the same for myself. I already have work_ but it still not enough with how much I work. At least I know my kids are ok where they are_ but would you like to to detail to you the fucking misery of being so fucking broke that you cannot financially support your own children and spouse while working to the point to exhaustion every fucking day while only having to look forward to the fact that I made money to run the car a few hours to not freeze to death when the temps get to 15 degrees in the night? The fuck is your point? Am I not miserable enough for you? Did I not frame my misery with enough light for you? Do you wanna play the pity game? I’m miserable to the point of that suicide seems great fucking regularly_ it has begun to be a serious problem for me. Miserable enough for you?  Jesus fucking Christ what what’s you fucking point even? Go sit and be warm and be fucking happy that you are not actively contributing to the suffering of those you love because you live in a society that would rather do away with the poor and the homeless and be stuck with the horrifying fact that even if you work yourself to death that they still won’t be ok.,Paczilla2,10,2,3,1530
j5jbagc,Homelessness is something different for everyone but you got to avoid the pitfalls. I made it a point when I was homeless living in my van to stay away from the toxic ones such as the drug addicts_ the fast talking scammer types_ drinkers_ and just anyone who got trapped in the the cycle of negativity.   The only time I found peace was when I was locked in my van with the tunes going_ in my bed.   For me the key to keeping it from getting miserable was progressing I went from losing my job getting divorced and the ex-wife getting everything to living in a van started off doing janitorial jobs_ deliveries_ got myself a security guard license then an armed guard license. I made my way to becoming a cop and then a deputy sheriff.   I retired on a disability pension after a bad car accident and heart attack on duty.   The key is to keep moving Do not stagnate progress.,johnfro5829,14,1,3,1530

I am homeless by choice_ basically um doing what you're contemplating.. Technically I'm a vagabond_ since I travel around alot. Fact is you're still gonna have to work in a way.

I'm very good with people_ motivated and in good physical health_ able to work while homeless_ in a city with moderate weather and good public transit_ and in a relationship with another person who is also all of the above. I feel like I'm doing fine.   Homelessness can mean eating found leftovers before sleeping in a 3 month old t-shirt for 20m on a freezing park bench before getting arrested for loitering. Or it can be hosting Thanksgiving dinner for your camp_ and waking with the sun to go to work. Or it can be 1000 things in between.

j5llgol,I think you’re already asking yourself the right question about if you’re just romanticizing it. If I were you I’d maybe not scrap the whole idea but like look into hostel at least or… I’m blanking on the name but found this through Reddit (wrong time or the year for where I’m at now and I’m disabled so didn’t think this was likely to work for me) but there are farms and such that will take volunteers and they’ll house you as long as you work and a website I’ve seen that will link you to ones around the country. I’d make some sort of plan like that over just straight up going homeless.   Because the one thing that I try to emphasize to folks and wish someone could’ve spelled out to me (didn’t really have a choice but this is definitely what took me by surprise hard) is that one of the worst things about homelessness is how hard it can be to get back out of. Like once you’re already unhoused life seems to have a way of throwing even more shit at you and kind of keeping you down. And so many of those bad things that would suck but be relatively easy to deal with while housed are a lot harder to deal with once homeless- talking thinks like an illness or injury_ being robbed_ having your car break down_ etc. even far smaller things just seem to have a way of piling up. I think I foolishly believed that being disabled would give me some kind of leg up. But nope. If anything it’s made it a lot harder.   Obviously I’m in a very different situation than you but broadly speaking it seems a lot of us never intended or expected our homelessness to continue as long as it has. It’s also stupid lonely sometimes. And dehumanizing. I suppose doing it by choice has the advantage of meaning less emotional baggage than what a lot of end up carrying (as in_ a whole lot went wrong in my life all at once that landed me in this position. Coping with that shit and trying to address those issues definitely makes things s lot harder). But still_ I’d say have a plan of some kind as much as possible.,Tzipity,1,1,3,1530

Don't give away too much personal info re your likes and interests. Anybody who dislikes you will be able to start to put pieces together to turn it around on you. Remember people are people. And desperate circumstances bring out the best and the worst in humans.   Some of the most frustrating and angering parts of being homeless is the loss of autonomy over your own life and the words with no actions. The way stigma informs services and funding_ as you have already seen. Often in really naive and useless ways that only make the trap worse.  Ask people what they need_ what they would like. That would have blown my mind. Especially when it comes to simple things like handouts of lotion and socks or whatever. I cried one time because I got some apples and it was just by chance they were in a box that was given to me. I had been really craving one_ but had no choices over the food that I ate.

City map can be useful if you're talking housing_ easy to point to an area and you can put pins in for relevant services for easy reference.   Photos/art etc can be nice to look at. I err toward well known characters/films/places etc_ as opposed to clearly personal stuff_ when I'm likely to have a lot of people coming through. You can tell someone about your own pets or interests if it feels safe and appropriate down the line_ but you can't walk back from someone recognising your dog that they've seen out in your garden or feeling like you won't relate to them because all your photos are from your graduation and expensive holidays.,Plus_Cut_8221,3,1,3,1530

For example_ Seattle and Portland are inundated with many homeless with drug issues because of the cities'  libertarian approach to drug possession.  Funding from the alliance can help finance more drug centers and safe places for them to gather_ rather than the streets and makeshift campgrounds.  In turn_ funding for economic distressed homeless in other areas of the country get help from the same alliance budget_ but addresses that specific problem.  Mental health services_ job programs_ affordable housing_ etc  all can be financed through this program.

Rather than wittle down the population_ my theory is that people in power want as many people in prison/indentured servitude as possible. Remember_ when they “outlawed” slavery_ they left a loophole : it’s legal if it’s as punishment for a “crime”. It is no accident that so many things have become a “crime” ever since that happened. The people in power basically want slavery back_ so they’re making everything a crime and trying to incarcerate as many people as possible. That’s how they’re going to get their “permanent underclass” of people to do all the things they don’t want to do for the cheap.,xhighestxheightsx,2,2,3,1530

You think they're taking shitty free food and clothes and everything else when they have access to better things?   And even if there were a bunch of people just taking advantage of the help_ why would you take resources from those who ARE struggling in order to stop them from doing so? Those priorities are as out of order as they can be.   Also_ how do they know that the resources made more homeless people come there? I'd imagine that when there are fewer resources fewer of the homeless population is documented.   Do they understand how hard it is to pick up and move?

j5imdrh,I'm going to be straight up and blunt here_ please read this as feedback for you: Disabilaty isn't an excuse_ never has been never will be. Reality check is that you made a choice that seems like it was a mistake and now you're facing issues.  An animal may be considered a service animal under certain circumstances_ you do NOT need a doctor to sign off on this if you're in a situation such as now.  Does your animal help you emotionally such as calm you down or help when you are having a sensory overload issue? Do you have a physical issue such as getting up and down and is suppor5ed by your animal?  If yes to either of these then you can get into a shelter with the animal because legally it asists with a medical condition that is helped by the animal and is not emotional such as depression. However the legality of the animal is that if it's a dog or not. There is no such thing as a service cat or bird or lizard or whatever other animal you pick. Miniature Horses are the only other legally accepted animal.  Back to Disability_ just because you or I have an issue doesn't give you an excuse to lean on your condition.  I have 2 bad vertebrae in my neck and an Unspecified nerve disorder that causes lockups.  I push myself daily and strive to be the best I am capable of being. I don't let my issues get in my way and when they do I just push on.     You can't let your issues control your life or get in your way.  You want to use your Disability as a crutch and that's obvious_ you allow it to get in your way and fail to use what you have at your disposal to your advantage.  Your Disability should give you priority and certain protections within reasonable scope of the law and laws. Using your Disability as an excuse is bullshit. I use mine as the truth as to why I can't always do things_ there's no excuse there only fact.  Movie recomendation: Fundamentals of Caring This might help give you a new look on things.    As people have said and attmpted to get you to understand you absolutely need to call the number listed and see about getting into a shelter.

j5k4fee,"I don't agree that the OP was being ungrateful. Based on what the OP stated_ i think his friends were playing a psychological game on him. Because if they wanted rent to begin with_ they would have asked for it upfront (in the form of a contract) - not wait 12 months later to ""evict"" him and claiming that he didn't pay rent for 12 months...  So_ his friends either wanted to appear as though they are doing him a favor or maybe they do care but they realize they have made an overcommitment (12 months is pretty generous).  But they ""evicted"" him because he wasn't able to use his ""gift"" that his friends gave him (a plane ticket as a gift???). And it's not a coincidence that the friend they were sending him to cancelled on him. We see that the OP didn't pick up the subliminal message initially (his friends wanted him out)_ however_ it is not difficult to simply communicate that you want someone out of your place. No need for the mind games.  I think a written agreement should have been established_ from the beginning_ to better protect OP. Although_ we can agree that we don't know the extent of his situation_ i don't think it's okay to dismiss the fact that people can_ indeed_ be shallow. It's possible that the OP could have done something to trigger them_ but either way_ we don't know for sure.

j5fj0js,As someone with cptsd sometimes people get tired of it. They probably thought it would change or go away but it’s not a cut. It’s a chronic condition that requires ongoing and continuous care. Even when you cannot get the care from a professional you must take care with your own mental state and the ways in which it taxes you.  Even paying rent it gets exhausting. I often keep many aspects to myself among friends for this reason. I don’t want to tire them out. Damned if I’m not constantly exhausted mentally and emotionally but I don’t want to tire them out too.   So I curse the internet instead! (Lol)  You stayed rent free for a year and froze getting on the plane. That can be a valid response however you need to understand that at this point your like a house guest who stayed months longer than they thought it would take.  $200.00 is a lot of money.   While they can’t legally evict you for the agreement had_ and while they cannot even sue you for a gift you never agreed to pay back in the first place_ it would be best to leave.   Interpersonal relationships can survive many things but they cannot survive contempt_ and it sounds like you are now in a contemptuous situation and relationship.   I’ve had people claim to have ptsd to me for there reason for not trying and I’ve never had a lick of patience for it.   You’ve made no headway as far as they are concerned.   I understand it’s easy to get lost in your own head but it looks like you had the opportunity to get on the plane and now you need to call 211 and find a shelter.   What things you have_ take them or find something to do with them.  Talk to them and let them know three days isn’t legal even for a legal eviction(a legal eviction is five days_ not three_ and a judge will laugh them out of the courtroom).   If you need this much support truly_ and have Medicaid etc_ you could also try to take yourself to a mental hospital but… speaking from what I know… that may make things worse rather than better depending on how that goes. However_ on the off chance you don’t get a shitty one they can even help with getting you assistance and even in a sixteen hour program etc.,ArtLadyCat,23,1,3,1530
j5f9yzm,You have been there long enough and have wore out your welcome. I would have taken the plane ticket it was a nice jesture and now they have wasted $200. Your problems are not their problems. Call 211 for resources.,Desperate-Long359,20,1,3,1530
j5g9ntd,You do not owe them for the gift. They can evict you even if you were staying for free with their permission. Generally someone who doesn't pay rent_ like someone living with their parents_ are effectively considered a month to month tenant under the law. So whatever law in your area that apply to month to month tenants applies to you. They can decide to end you tenancy with proper notice even if it was agreed you stayed for free. But you owe them nothing for the gift. The law does not allow people to give gifts and then sue to get it back except under very limited circumstances.  I would need to know the location_ or city_ to know whether 3 days are sufficient. Probably not unless they are claiming a for cause eviction. But the thing is that they can't kick you out after 3 days. To legally kick you out they have to wait till the notice ends_ file an eviction with the court_ and then have the judge authorize a forceful eviction. I wouldn't push it so far as to get a court ordered eviction_ but it might be possible to buy more time than 3 days. With a location and exactly what the notice to vacate said I could probably say more.,mywan,2,1,12,1488

j5fi3dh,Hey newly homeless friend. No worries_ you got this.  Free Caffeine: Grocery stores/gas stations/donut palace/mechanics/motels - any place that offers it generally won’t charge you for a black coffee if you bring your own mug & you display good manners & charm. Treat people well.  Places Where you need to be hanging around more: Churches/Temples/Worship/Any Addiction meetings_ followed next by Civic areas like courthouse/shelters/soup kitchens. These are places where folks will passively or actively help you. Be kind_ helpful_ and more involved in helping them out and they can move mountains for you.   When you need solitude & privacy ride the bus/subway. Underpasses_ highway areas_ be sure to sleep with insulation between you and the ground_ followed by quiet empty parks (careful though for Thieves_ Karens & Cops) Lastly shitty industrial areas (but only if you’re well supplied & street smart) are pretty deserted & no one cares if you’re not destructive.   These are three “safer” places to hang out when you’re homeless. People/cops are less likely to fuck with you around these areas. You can put together a few moments of peace here. Use it to strategize: 1. Work on securing a permanent address. Doesn’t matter if it’s your bf’s cousin or a gas station. If it can receive mail_ it will make everything easier. 2. Get set up with social services_ do NOT inadvertently disappear from the system_ because of your homelessness. 3. Keep trying_ keep pan-handling_ keep connecting to people_ don’t give up! If you have trouble connecting_ try a reporter or journalist. It’s important that the voiceless be given a platform. Your story is important.   Once you disappear from society…you may end up in the classic scene…found dead_ likely from exposure behind the S-Mart down the street_ forever silent & forgotten.

j5hgm71,"This is so unhealthy and not ideal. You need to find a place you can sleep where you won't get shooed. This can can easy if you are comfortable sleeping around others. Just find the local sleep spots where other homeless stay. There are also all sorts of incognito places that will be tucked away where you can at least sleep_ maybe while sitting_ for at least a while. You need to be creative and adventurous though. You need to find spots where other people almost never go. You can also do a rotation to try and find businesses that WON'T shoo you while you are sleeping. My mom works for the state and she told me her building had a homeless man sleeping in the doorway. He would come after the building closed and would leave before anyone came in the morning_ generally. People only saw him rarely and all the staff_ being social workers and welfare workers_ were very sympathetic to homeless people. A couple people left him stuff like food every once in a while.  You really need sleep. Sleep deprivation is insanely damaging to your body and mind. I'm not just talking about staying awake for days straight. Chronic sleep deprivation will make you vulnerable to infection_ it will worsen or trigger any mental health disorders you may or may not have_ and it will cause a lot of physical pain over time. I dealt with sleep deprivation even just sleeping in a shelter since they open so late and close so early. Warming centers_ if one exists in your city or town_ will generally allow sleeping during the day until they shut down. I'd recommend going to any shelter or other homeless outreach place(welfare offices and employment offices will often know_ many churches will as well) to ask people where you can find one.  Stimulants will work. If you are an addict and are already consuming drugs_ meth or another amphetamine will keep you awake and keep you warm if you get enough calories each day. If you don't eat enough it can hasten hypothermia and weight loss though. I had a meth problem for a long time and I could sweat in a blizzard while high. I'm pretty fat so I had the fuel to burn.   You really need sleep tho. Don't do drugs if ur not already an addict. If you are an addict_ try to go to treatment. It will give you a bed and a month and often housing resources. My local treatment center prided itself on ""almost never discharging a patient who literally had no place to go but the streets"". I don't know where you are so your mileage will vary.  And yes you build tolerance to caffeine rapidly. Your body adapts to it really quickly and it won't work.",goldscurvy,2,1,11,964

If you really want to stay awake without abusing illegal stuff_ figure out how long your sleep cycles are and how many you need each night - mine are two hours long and I need at least 4 - and you can split them up through the day. They call it polyphasic sleep. You do have to kinda nail down meal timing and stuff for it work as well as it could. Also_ make sure you hydrate as much as you can. Caffeine can be a diuretic and if you don't have enough water_ it won't work as well. Frankly_ you can also try Sudafed/pseudoephedrine with your coffee_ as it's an amphetamine derivative_ and yes_ it will work like that. Red bull and anything that has a bunch of B-vitamin derivatives will work in the very short term_ but don't rely on them - it's going to work much better if you just take B-vitamin supplements. Honestly_ if you can afford it_ hit up Grocery Outlet_ grab some caffeine pills and B0-vitamins and it should help keep you up.   Finally_ if you want to go the energy drink route_ there is one called ""Double Dragon"" if I remember the name right and it has some astronomically high amount of caffeine. Back before I knew how bad it was to mix caffeine with my meds_ I would hit a few of those when I wanted to stay up super late and shit_ and whoa. They also cost like a dollar. I had to get them at Winco_ if you have those in your area.",pnwerewolf,1,1,3,1530

j5qhxyw,"Don't buy anything quickly. Think about it. Don't listen to anyone telling you ""You need to buy this"" To be honest $11 is so little I think you shouldn't buy anything with it right now. For example_ don't buy a nalagne. You can use/reuse old plastic water bottles. You can get one later if you really need it. Save that $11 for something YOU need when you actually need it.  If you only have $11_ you'll quickly realize that food and water is much more important most important amenities. Are you covered for that at the shelter?  If you're buying stuff_ BUY IT USED. Don't buy new. Craigslist_ Facebook marketplace is your haven for now. I'm assuming you have alot more time than money. Also if you have a phone_ register for facebook marketplace. (Craiglist is dead) If you are not active on facebook or have never registered before; you'll need to get approved. It took me a couple days to get on it because I deleted my FB accounts years before. (Maybe consider a battery bank if you don't have one already.)  SCOUR marketplace for free things_ cheaps things.

j5clxoa,If you are looking to do this long-term you should consider buying a prius. They are literally generators on wheels. You can run the car all night using the climate control because it runs off the hybrid battery. But if you must live in your Honda I would suggest looking for videos on YouTube of people's setups that live out of their cars. Hybrid cars are better because the engine barely runs and people won't notice you as much. I would suggest staying at 24 hour gyms or places you feel comfortable. You'll need window covers. I would suggest weathertech_ they are custom made. Use Google maps and use the satellite view to scan potential parking areas. Your biggest challenge will be figuring out where to sleep at night. I stay at truck stops and 24 hour gyms and occasionally apartment complexes. Good luck!,Lazy-Perception-5818,2,1,3,1530

Everyone's experience being homeless is different.   There is a contingent of people out there who offer help to the homeless but expect  something fucked up in return. (Sex_ domestic slavery_ control_ etc.) Most of us are very wary of anyone we don't know_ or another homeless person we know hasn't vouched for_ offering to pull us out if homelessness.

Free rent is like they’re paying you $500 a month_ and you need to earn it with sweat and thoughtfulness. And you have to act grateful about them letting you stay in exchange for you practically being their live-in maid. Otherwise_ you’re just accepting $500+ money from them_ robbing them of their own space_ and giving them nothing in return.

j58zu9t,I'm currently in a situation like that.  Totally been there.  October of last year_ I went to Denver briefly with the last bits of my money to stay with a friend_ got locked out because his roommate and I didn't exactly see eye to eye.  My first night sleeping on the streets was there.    I never understood how lack of sleep and exhaustion could be so taxing on your mental health until that night_ and the paranoia surrounding finding a relatively safe space to sleep can be when you are out there.  You never know who will turn up_ if they'll try to steal your belongings or what.  Recently got an opportunity to stay with family in Virginia_ who I never really got along with to begin with.  The same cycle has repeated.  And now I'm getting kicked out on my birthday at the end of the month :/.  The shelter near here doesn't seem too bad and someone is letting me keep my things in a storage facility_ so there's a bit of a silver lining at least.  I really hope you can find your silver lining and a better opportunity comes your way.  If you get the chance_ there's this audiobook I listened to recently called [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu4QwpQddtg&ab_channel=MzimaAudioLibrary) that really has been helpful.

j5cwwqm,My daughter’s card would not work.  It took almost 6 months of going around in circles to get the problem solved.  I finally got a letter that said use it or lose it and it was nearly $2000 with the pandemic extras.  I called_ irritated at the letter because I had been trying to resolve the issue for months.  Talked to a guy_ he said no problem and we had a working card in 3 days.  So why couldn’t the other people help?    If you are homeless buy meal replacement powders_ protein powder in favorite flavor_ vegetable powders that are also drinks and freeze dried fruit.  You will need a shaker tumbler and water and/or powdered milk.  Then just fill in with simple proteins even if it is those long meat sticks or jerky.  Easy nutrition.  Not cheap but not a problem for you right now.  You can order it on Amazon and have it sent to General Delivery at a post office near you if you are homeless. They take packages.

Don't forget to directly ASK the people for money afterwards. This can be hard at first but makes a huge difference_ you'll need to work out your own style.

j575zak,Natural fibers are far better at keeping warm while still being breathable. Polyester is like wearing a plastic bag_ it won't keep you as warm and it won't breath_ so sweat builds up. The obvious problem here is that natural fiber clothing is generally much more expensive.  If you are able to find anything wool as a base layer that should help wick the moisture away from your body so it won't cool you down. Avoid cotton_ it is cheaper than wool or linen_ but it doesn't wick moisture as well and will have the same problem re:sweat building up close to the body. Alternatively_ there are some synthetics that are made to wick moisture and keep you warm_ those are usually athletic wear made for hiking or something. Wool socks and hiking sock liners_ wool Longjohns/long underwear_ or any other wool base layer is what I'd look for first_ then moisture wicking synthetics as a second choice.,murder-waffle,2,1,3,1530
j5bbrxu,Word!  I love animal fiber for insulation and thermoregulation_ but I rarely can wear next to skin because I find even merino to be itchy (high quality brands like Smartwool_ Icebreaker_ Karo Traa etc.)  My background is camping/backpacking_ which is not the same as sleeping on the street_ but there's some overlap.  My solution is to wear really thin REI silk long underwear or really thin Patagonia capeline.  I am sure there are cheaper brands that will do the same for less $ but I don't know them.  I've heard fleece Walmart Cuddl Dudds (sp?) Brand works for clean baselayers for sleeping overnight.  You might want to look into budget Ultralight backpacking/thru hiking (eg hiking straight from Mexico to Canada) gear bc these people are hardcore about carrying very few items that need to function in a variety of environments.    Anyhow_ for layers I have very thin silk/synthetic_ then on top of that Smartwool 250 or some similar layer.  A wool or cashmere sweater would work just fine.  At a thrift store go through sweaters & search for 100% cashmere or camel if you can find it_ or 100% wool.  I buy from resellers online and if there's some moth holes_ they will sell for really cheap.   Don't wear anything tight fitting_ your initial baselayer can hug your body_ but should NOT be tight (eg yoga pants and leggings are bad). Subsequent layers should also not be tight.  On top of sweater can be more sweaters_ or a big down puffy etc.  On top of your insulation should be a windproo layer_ and if raining_ a waterproof layer.    Just beware that anything waterproof or waterproof/breathable will NOT breathe that well_ and you'll probably start sweating in it if you are walking/moving.  I also can't wear a wool hat directly on my forehead_ so I use polyester fleece for that.  Same thing for scarves -- polyester fleece neck gaiter.,cozydriver,3,2,3,1530

What cash can you come up with?  Flying a sign_ calling people you've called before for one final request for anything.... $10 even.. selling any belongings that can add dollar bills to the pile.    Somewhere near you... and by ""near"" I mean in the same town_ county_ or district_ there is a vehicle to be had.  It is going to be cheap_ and it will run.  It might be down to only having one brake operating... or it might be missing a shock absorber (I've purchased both)... but it will run and it will be dirt cheap.  It will get you to a place where the weather will not kill you_ or it will get you closer to one at any rate.  It will provide you with shelter that you can turn into a home on wheels_ regardless of the size and your budget.  Old clothes stuffed into the footwells of the rear passenger section_ can level out that seat to be a much wider bed.  You don't need to purchase some inflatable mattress to do the same.  You can even be neat_ and keep folded clothes in nylon bags_ and use THOSE to fill the footwells and the widening of the base of your ""bed"".  Or pillow cases instead of bags.  Like... sandbags_ except that's where you keep your clothes.  When it isn't a bed_ you break the bags out to get at the clothes.  That is just looking at one person can do with a couple hundred dollars (It was $300 for the van with no brakes_ and $400 for the truck with three shocks).  Now... I \*do\* actually know how insurmountable even a couple hundred dollars can seem.  This is why_ if you really do feel you are at the end of your rope_ you should consider letting go of anything you've held on to_ if it can get you to the goal of purchasing some shit-box of a car.  This is why you consider talking to people you tapped out years ago_ for one final donation.  Tell them what it is for.  Tell them why... because it will keep you off the streets_ and it will help you find the place where you \*can\* get a foothold.  It doesn't matter if you have a license.  I know.... I know.  I'm not trying to tell you to become a criminal.  Today_ if you are mobile... you \*do\* have a greater chance of being told to ""find a place to park it and don't drive""_ as opposed to them actually towing the vehicle.  Especially_ if this is the first time they are seeing/stopping you.... and you aren't currently a notation on their paperwork already.  Which means if you are going from point A to point B... and point B is a new town or state where there are resources available for you in your situation_ getting stopped by a local or state cop WILL most likely result in them letting you go.  This of course_ does vary per state.... in Washington State_ a supreme court ruling in 2018 on the state's Homesteading Act essentially ruled that a vehicle with Washington plates is a home_ and thus cannot be taken away from someone who lives in it.  Even if the person living in it doesn't OWN the vehicle_ as was the case \*in\* the legal case which sparked this decision.  A guy in Seattle_ living in a friend's broken down truck_ got the truck towed.  It was parked outside of the allowed industrial area there where overnight parking is allowed.  He got the truck back_ no legal or impound fines.  Now_ streets in Olympia look like RV parks.  The point is... get mobile_ and get moving.  It is far easier to ""Go Jugging"" at a strange gas station_ begging a gallon at a time and occasionally meeting people who fill your tank_ than it is to remain landlocked into a location that you already know has nothing for you.  It would be cheaper to get a bus ticket somewhere... but that implies knowing a destination beforehand.  You need shelter now_ and a vehicle will provide that shelter.  By and large it will provide the most resistance to the elements_ while being durable enough to withstand the most punishing of weather.  And the point is to get you out of where you are_ and somewhere that is friendlier to you in the immediate.  And... if you are looking at living outside right now as your only option... your immediate landscape is finding better weather.  That requires mobility.  You can walk.  You can bike.  You can hitch (not recommended)_ you can hop (not recommended)... you can drive (eh... yeah_ I'm recommending it)... you can bus or train_ but that's a single expensive push_ that still leaves you exposed to the weather for some duration in the new setting.  By using a vehicle_ you at least have that shell as shelter in the new town/city/state.  UNTIL you can make use of whatever local resources are available there.  Think of it this way... $400 can get you a bus ticket and a short stay at a cheap motel_ or it could get you a vehicle that takes you there and houses you until you get into a shelter or better housing situation.  And potentially get you out of there if things don't work out_ and to another place entirely.  Where do you find these vehicles?  Start with welding shops_ boiler shops_ industrial areas... anywhere that manufactures and delivers locally whatever services they provide.  For example_ a boiler shop bought three HVAC vans at an auction (the HVAC company had gone out of business).  They bought them for the parts on the shelves inside of the vans (fittings_ pipes_ hoses).  Once they emptied the vans (since the parts were worth far more than what they paid for the vans)_ they stored them out behind their shop.  Two of the vans still ran.  One ran well enough to drive down the east coast_ from New England to Florida_ back to New England_ and back down to North Carolina.  For $300.  It might be a bakery that has their own delivery vans_ and they've got one out behind their store that isn't being used anymore.  Or like the printing company in Tallahassee that had a van they weren't using_ because there were entry and exit bullet holes in the windshield (entry) and about a foot behind the driver's head in the left side of the van (exit).  No one was in the van when it was shot.  Or the short bus at the bus maintenance garage in Aberdeen_ WA_ that wasn't being used because of superficial damage to the rear quarter that wasn't cost effective to repair.    It will require leg work to find these... because you are looking for something that some business doesn't care about selling_ which is why it will be so cheap_ and sitting on some property unused.  But this is a common ""thing"" among smaller businesses of these types.  Vehicles get retired and written off that are still usable_ and you taking it off their hands saves them the trouble of transporting it to scrap for the $250.  Which brings up another place to beg for a car... Pick n Pull lots_ auto-graveyards_ car junk yards.  Often_ they will get cars that still run_ and they paid $200-$250 for them... or they got paid to tow them away.  They can also be a source of cheap cars that will give you $500 worth of performance_ likely more.  And... when you get a foothold where you end up_ you can junk it for that same $200-$250 as seed money.  ...  If you already have a car.  Get into it.  Dump what won't fit_ with you living in it.  Get somewhere with better weather.  Scour the area for available resources as you already are well acquainted with doing.  Or Get into the car_ and find a library.  Connect online_ and search nearby states for what resources are available... you can look up local PIT counts for how many homeless shelter beds are available versus the number of homeless in that city/town/county.  Find a place with high bed counts_ or low numbers of homeless closer to the number of available beds_ and there will be shorter wait times to get into shelters_ and likely other programs like transitional housing to keep the local numbers down.  Just remember_ you are fighting against the weather as much as anything else.  Warmer climates during the winter are better than colder_ when homeless.",bongart,2,1,8,1024

j5b37c7,If your parents need happiness_ are you certain that you're departure will provide them with that?  Instead of hoisting guilt on you_ it is just as likely that their personal guilt will increase. And their health will then reflect that.  Leaving might make you feel free from the burdens of society and social interaction_ but the trauma associated with homelessness will accrue in a way that you cannot predict or control.  Some people experience enough trauma within just a few months of homelessness that will affect them for the rest of their lives. There is a very real chance that homelessness will compound the issues that you already have into an incapacity that is beyond what you have already experienced.  Perhaps there is another way to make things work at home. I would certainly never tell you what to do_ but oftentimes there are unforeseen consequences to the decisions that we make.,INFOborg,1,1,3,1530

Next thing i would do is try and secure a car for $500-$1000.  this you can use to sleep in etc.  store all your clothes etc.  next_ i would post up near a planet fitness.  first you gotta get a planet fitness membership which is $10 a month.  posting up near a planet fitness you can use this gym to shower whenever you wanna shower and shit and get cleaned up.  other then that dude i would maybe look into building a home in the woods maybe somewhere inbetween the car and the planet fitness and maybe a 711 lol.  in the woods if i were you i would have a fuck ton of peanut butter and i would build a home with fuckin cellophane.  have you ever seen how you can take a like industrial role of cellophane and just wrap that bitch around a tall structure you build with logs or branches or some shit.  its doable.  i have a lot more ideas too homie if you need em,atkrighteous,2,3,3,1530

Just having someone there while you fill in all the little boxes and cross your t's and dot your i's really makes a difference.

j588vo9,Illinois is so good about rapidly getting people food stamps. Apply online right now if you’re able (I was called the next day when I first moved to IL from MI as a very low income disabled person who did have housing and they had me food stamps in days basically). Though I guess you have the issue of needing an address for them to mail the EBT card to. I’m in a different state at the moment but know when I applied for benefits here I was able to mark myself as homeless and use another address so if you have a friend or someone’s address you can use. Or go to a Department of Human Services office in person and see if they can help.   I know shelters and such will often let you use their address or there’s something where you can have your mail held at the post office.   Basically I would try to work out some way to get EBT because IL is one of more generous states there and you could have money to buy food in a matter of days.,Tzipity,1,1,3,1530

j4y9vxs,"That's THE worst_ I feel your pain.      My fiance held all my shit hostage when we broke up a handful of times. By ""Held my shit hostage"" I mean EVERYTHING.      A few times all I had was 2 tshirts_ a hoodie_ a pair of socks_ 2 pairs of leggings_ and a ponytail holder. That's it. No place to stay at all_ no food_ no phone (or any way to communicate with ppl)_ No drugs (I was/still am fighting a severe addiction so it was ROUGH going without)_ and NO SHOES.   It rlly was the fucking worst thing ever.       I didn't even have to deal with the cold like you but I did have to deal with nonstop rain & 100 degree temps. My feet stayed wet 24/7 and we're torn to shreds from walking around in only socks for weeks.      It got to the point where I had a really bad infection of some sort on the tops of both of my feet (I imagine from the constant wetness). One of them was so SO bad. My foot - & eventually my leg - started randomly cramping up & giving out when I'd try to walk. I finally got my bike back & I couldn't even ride it.       My feet were sunburned too because at some point I had to get rid of the socks (too many holes). My dad bought me a piat of flip flops & some sweatpants since it was all they had at Walmart on clearance. He only had 11 bucks to his & no place to stay himself.   Thank God for my dad.      The flip flops made it worse though! I got cuts that were so deep/hurt so bad (where the little plastic piece goes between your toes) that i couldn't even stand up for 3 days! I also had to stay in a bedbug infested house & in a tent in the woods where 100s of mesquitos - yes I mean literally hundreds of them - would swarm me  the second I walked near my campsite.       So_ I ended up with bed bug bites that I had scratched huge holes in_ tons of mesquito bites (even on the soles of my feet)_ + many cuts_ scrapes_ & blisters. And a fucking TICK that was in between my toes. I was too lethargic/sick/scared to pull it out so I left it in for 5 days.   My feet literally looked like zombie feet (lol). They sure as hell didn't look like they belonged on anyone who was alive to say the least.   I still have scars & pain from that and it was back in June 2022.

It seems like you are going through your own version of hell. I just would not want to see it get worse.   It is far too common for suicide attempts to go wrong and just make life much more difficult. It is why I advocate for the option of voluntary assisted dying for adults because life can be absolutely terrible_ even if it can be amazing at times. I would not want people to be encouraged to end their lives_ but a compassionate and more effective method versus train tracks is an option I think all humans deserve.

I’m here looking to help someone out_ but the thing is one of my friends chose to be homeless and does tons of drugs. I’ve tried really hard to not be judgmental. The answer I’ve found to most things is when people look at groups things get bad but when you look at an individual you can see the humanity in each person’s story. But most people don’t have the time to care.,Perfectkore,7,1,3,1530
j4yqntp,Because you're the one percent homeless that's online_ that's actually in a homeless situation. The other 99 percent. Are actors.

And set a camera up etc. Why can't you work? When they can shut up_ and go to hell. People can be so ignorant. Who's gonna hire someone homeless with no suit_ gaps in their resume_ or no address_ etc. It's steps we take to get our lives back etc.   What I'm about to tell you_ you're not gonna like. But I would avoid video blogging about being homeless unfortunately. We deal with shit IRL_ but we don't need to deal with it online.

j4z0orj,I work for the Goodwill and have only narrowly avoided homelessness a few times now in the past 7 months. I work on the e-commerce side though_ packing boxes. One of my coworkers started talking shit about some of the homeless people that hang out near our building that are outside our door sometimes. Some of them do have obvious drug problems (we see them doing it) but most of them are just like me. I had to work real hard to keep my mouth civil when he started saying something because not only am I living on the brink but *we have coworkers on our team who are homeless right now and have a full time job* because we are in one of the most overpriced and unhelpful cities in the country (Seattle). I skew older (I'm a Xennial) but there are so many fucking people now_ in real life and social media_ who just. Don't. Get it. They don't get how much built in privilege you have to have just to literally not starve nowadays. My father and his wife ruined my finances_ my education_ my social life and I have a host of my own struggles besides; I have barely been able to pick up the pieces_ and I'm *lucky*. These idiots on social media especially_ where there are no consequences for shit spewing to an audience because no one can heckle you - I'm not going to say kids_ because I'm not lumping you in like that_ OP - have reached this point where they are simply so insulated from the realities of the world we live in now in America that those of us that aren't like them are not only invisible_ but we're living proof that their whole reality is founded on lies_ money_ privilege and exploitation and so they hate and fear us.,pnwerewolf,4,1,3,1530
j50oriq,Not just on social media. Everywhere homeless are treated awful. People assume you’re a drug addict or lazy. They try to find reasons to justify your situation and convince themselves you deserve it because of your own doing. I guess it’s easier for them to do that then to realize it’s the system that puts homeless people in that situation. People can’t really rap their brain around homelessness in a country where there is so much wealth because then they would have to acknowledge their own privilege.,poet_redkiss,3,1,3,1530

j5xp0qs,Because there are a lot of people out there who are self-centred and lazy. Rather than have a bit of respect for other people by making themselves aware of the broken system that leads to so many homeless_ they would rather be disrespectful and lazy by asking us to repeat ourselves over and over to describe the terrible circumstances that led to our situation.

j4z934n,"Some people go the homeless way as they're trying to escape this ridiculous rent and inflation. Seems though_ it can cost some pretty good money to get into a position to prepare for it.  Others can fade into it from things pulled out of a bottle. That is booze and prescription drugs.  Then they're some whom fall into it from too much debt that becomes overwhelming.   Point is they will always be people who want to b*tch about something. In this case_ it's about homelessness. I can turn on the news sometimes and some city is going to have to vacate_ move and clean out a homeless camp_ folks have set up because the well-to-dos are fussing at Commissioners about it stinking up their property values or whatever.  This is just the way life is these days. You always going to have certain ones griping at others about something.  You just have to grow a thick skin to ignore them and deal with it. Hey_ it works too. It states in the good book_ ""let him without sin cast the first stone_ and don't  judge others lest ye be judged.""  Nobody is better than anyone else! Those that think they're better than you have to put on the same big boy pants you wear. Why you let them anger or tempt you? In reality_ you just might be in better financial shape than their current situation.   Learn to adapt and overcome what bothers you. Learning to control both emotions and thoughts crosses out negativity. Nothing good comes from harnessing bad thoughts and negative actions.  Now my understanding from the Holy book is that Jesus was homeless too! I know what I read out of it says nothing about him having gold and silver with a nice concrete slab mansion on another side of a river.  He walked most everywhere_ slept out under the stars_ born in a barn_ ate what he was offered_ stayed with friends_ neighbors or family sometimes.  Now that is something to think about my friend.

Speaking from experience - this woman will NOT be satisfied until she destroys you. Being spiritually dead is worse than being physically dead imo and this is what she is doing.   Get your place sorted out as soon as you can_ and crash at family/friends houses in the meantime if you can. But leave that ungrateful *woman* alone.   Then find you a nice woman deserving of your goodness. Stop playing step daddy role as well man. Not trying to be disrespectful.

j4u4xjr,"I'll be honest - pets adjust. That's a hard truth. I have lived with my roommate since August and he has a *very fucked up dog* that we love to death. I am a dog person and since I moved in_ the dog has now become incredibly attached to both of us. 90% of the time_ one or the other of us is home and he is always with one of us - or both. We also have mental health issues (mine are pretty severe) and I don't socialize much anymore_ which adds to the dog attachment. He was alone for 15 minutes the other day between when my roommate left and when I got home from getting some dinner_ and the dog literally crawled into my sweatshirt because he missed me so much (he is a 90 lbs German Shepherd mix; I am a 195lbs 6'3"" man_ but my clothes are only so big).  My roommate does travel sometimes_ though_ and when he is gone_ I have to leave the dog alone during the day while I'm at work. And he is okay. It normally takes him a day to adjust_ but then he learns to self-soothe. And while he is definitely by my side the whole time that I am home (he was very badly abused for the first two years of his life_ and we suspect he may have been involved in dog fighting or something that involved another dog attacking him constantly_ so he gets incredibly attached to people as his caregivers)_ he also learns quickly to cope without having me around all the time. Animals *aren't* people. They aren't. They don't have metacognition_ not really_ they don't think like we do. They get attached to us_ but they don't understand what we *are.* Your cats are the same. They are very attached to you_ but they are more attached to survival. If your cats have a good home to go to_ there will be an adjustment period for them_ but they will survive and thrive_ especially if you trust the person that will foster them and you continue to visit them.   Also_ from the way you have phrased your post_ it sounds like your cats have never actually had to be away from you_ so you don't know how they will react - and because animals don't think like us_ you have to change how you think about their behavior. Our animals don't see us as ""human family."" They see us as companions that are a *way for them to survive.* Dogs are domesticated. Cats are commensal. Domestic cats specifically have evolved to approximately mimic the cry of a human baby to keep your attention in that way and to stimulate that part of the human animal brain. In that way_ they co-opt our own deeply rooted biological behaviors to survive. Your cat wants your attention because it has evolved to want it and you have evolved to prioritize it because of how it sounds. Our pets have also evolved to stimulate the release of oxytocin in our brains_ which is why we look at our pets and go ""omg I have to just SQUISH HIM UNTIL HE BECOMES A PART OF MY BODY HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY"". I do that literally every day. I look at the dog over and over and my brain just goes ""look at this cute thing I need to have it I want to carry it around with me everywhere and take care of it."" He has literally evolved to do that to me. Both dogs and cats also offer humans other benefits besides_ but that is tangential here. Both dogs and cats are programmed biologically to highjack our brains to ensure we care for them_ and cats especially stimulate the parts of human brains that make us care for them kind of like babies. This is also why cats and dogs learn tricks so fast_ including attention seeking tricks - they just know that the more we lavish them with attention_ the longer they will be taken care of and survive. We give in to that normally and reward them for being cute with more attention and love and pets and food_ and the cycle repeats.  But all this happens because our pets are animals and they want to survive.   Like any living thing_ your cats will definitely have an adjustment period. They *will* experience distress because they will be in a new environment where they have to learn how to seek out care and feeding and how to get it_ but assuming your friend who is fostering them similarly likes and cares for cats_ they will adapt. Your friend will need to take care with the avoidant cat_ of course_ but it will come around. The best thing you can do for them is to ensure that they are properly cared for in a way that is similar to how you care for them now_ but you have to trust in the resilience of your animals becuase that is what they are and why we have them around_ too - it's not just to comfort us_ but it demonstrates resilience_ too.   Finally_ and it's important to stress this - pets *aren't* human people. This doesn't mean that they are robots or something_ and they are people_ of a sort but they *aren't* human people. They do not have the same kinds of thoughts and feelings we do and very importantly_ they do not experience trauma in the same way that we do. They definitely *DO* experience trauma_ but they simply don't process it in the way that we do and they don't become traumatized by things the way that we do. As long as your pet is getting its physical needs met - food_ water_ shelter_ medicine_ safety_ etc. - that is paramount_ and they will likely adapt. I know that sounds weird to think about_ but our pets don't lie awake at night wondering about why we suddenly ""don't seem to love them anymore_ as they don't understand that we love them - they only understand that we demonstrate that love through care and physical affection. They *will* fixate on why we stopped feeding them, or if suddenly we react differently to one of their behaviors, but they don't think about it that way. They have an inner life but it is constrained by their limited grasp of the world, which itself is constrained by how their memories work, and they have no proper theory of mind. They *will* miss *you* specifically - but again, as long as you minimize the changes in how they are treated and interacted with, they will do okay.   Don't take your cats with you. Please don't. I have had a few friends fall into that trap out of the belief that it will be too hard on their pet because they will miss me too much"" and every time_ the pet dies. Every. Time. A plan that minimizes the changes to ease the transition would be something along the lines of ensuring that they have the same litter boxes and the same kind of cat litter_ that feeding happens at the same time each day if you do it that way_ that you don't change their cat food_ that they have access to their same kind of toys_ things like that. Ensuring that physical care remains as close to what you give them now is the absolute best thing you can do.",pnwerewolf,14,1,3,1530

j4otb3q,Los Angeles is huge but I'm mostly between downtown and the Westside.  * If you don't have a job_ it's boring. There's only so much to do on your laptop or phone besides apply to jobs and look at feeds. Reading_ writing_ and drawing are essentially free hobbies though. So is walking.  * Fast food is stupidly cheap if you do it right. I can get entire meals for $2. Grocery stores are getting absurdly expensive (except Trader Joe's).   * A car is safety and security. Shelters are not. Shelters may protect you from the elements but they also push into groups of people who are not as mentally stable as you.   * Public transportation is amazingly affordable and convenient. Metro Bike Share is underutilized by most of the population even though it's the best form of transportation in downtown.   * Rent is a leash. I'm saving $25_000/year by not having an apartment. I will actually be able to save up more money than a lot of other people in the city *because* I can't afford an apartment_ and by working half as many hours.  * Nothing helps more than a good friend. They can offer a couch_ a cup of coffee_ a shower_ a floor_ or even just quality time. Distractions are essential_ which is one reason I think alcohol and drug use is so high. We need an escape_ and vices are quick and easy.  * Anyone who has never spent a night on the street has no idea the destruction it does to a person's psyche. It exponentially destroys a person's mental health. If we passed a law that required every person to spend 1 night on the street when they turn 18_ everyone would vote against it as inhumane_ but we don't seem to mind letting the most vulnerable people in society suffer it daily.  * You wouldn't recognize a lot of homeless people because they hide it very well. The obvious ones become the stereotype.,405freeway,6,1,3,1530

My phone number is for Portland_ OR and so it connected me to the Portland 211 number. When I explained my situation_ they then were able to give me the right contact info for the Seattle/King County line.

Though it raises_ its own question. Even if in the U.S. or just barely outside a forest surrounded major city_ they've also insured that no one has the skills needed to just go rogue and live as a cavemen for the rest of their days. They've built an education system that purposefully teaches nothing such that you can never be raised learning how to hunt or fish either. They've quite literally killed everyone's ability to just live on the earth in peace.,Icy-Weather2164,1,2,3,1530
j4iegxb,Yes_ the school system is based on capitalism. It’s not meant to teach us survival skills or how to thrive in society_ it’s exists to make rich people richer. It teaches kids to be obedient workers and become part of the system. Consumers.   You’d be caught living off the land in Canada though. Even in BC and Ontario/Quebec where there’s land for days they have helicopters doing sweeps. I think you can legally set up camp on crown land for 3 weeks (21 days). I’ve camped that long in the Rockies and didn’t have any trouble from the Rangers that came by to check on things. But if you were to make a go of it for food and shelter (as a lifestyle) you’d get caught. Even in Canada.  You can’t grow anything that quick and hunting would be noticed eventually. Even if you have the skills_ realistically_ you’d get caught because of the needs you’d have as a person living off the grid in the wilderness.,BotGivesBot,1,2,3,1530

I loved on the street from 97 till 03 and learned how to live in a city with no money but i wish I'd been taught how to survive in the bush_ i think some of the stuff i learned from being homeless kinda applies to living in the bush but not a lot of it.

What about asking to share something at church and when you get the turn to speak you just say ""I just want to remind everyone that Jesus was a homeless man.""  But then do it every single Sunday. Hobophobia is so wide spread that your church is bound to have some in it's congregations. This would be a good way to elicit small change. Maybe also add proverbs about what you do to the those to the least you do to God. I forget the actual quote but you could say after that ignoring them when they speak to you or discriminating against them in public or as part of your job is no different than doing the same to Jesus himself.  If you made your statement every week it may only enrage the secret hobophobes but it will stick with their children and they will start calling out their parents.",AngelicDevilz,2,5,3,1530

It took 9 years to get back on my feet and I can truly say that I did it by myself with limited support from so called family and friends. I am not ashamed to cut people off. They were not ashamed to do the same to me so I just return the favor. The feeling is mutual. Do not be angry at doing for yourself. Do not let others selfishness eat at your happiness and peace.

j4j6ef9,"I was heartbroken_ crying_ and feeling the emotions while reading OP and this comment.   Same thing happened to me when I lived in my SUV for 341 days (Jan 21_ 2022 - Dec 28_ 2022) after a breakup with an abusive alcoholic broke into someone else's apt while drunk_ resulting in both of us getting evicted (of course he didn't display any red flags before I moved in with him!) and then struggled working for many small businesses that left me stressed out and tired all the time_ gaining weight and hating myself the most for getting so low— even suffering COVID during the summer heat and then being let go from a job because the neurotic female owner was scared of getting COVID herself.   The worse feeling was being neglected by my local church and community group that I attended. The few people who I was completely vulnerable with about my situation were always shocked_ since my suv is a MB_ the previous year I was making good money_ and I always dress well. When it first happened_ I cried to my pastor on what to do or if there are any families able and willing to take me in as I look for work_ but the best he could tell me was to sell my suv_ get into an affordable apt_ and ride the bus. But at the time I was relying on my suv for earning quick money by delivering for UberEats.   I remember having days of joy_ gratitude_ drive_ and motivation... then [more] days of anger_ sadness_ self-pity and self-loathing. Anger at the people who say they believe in being like Jesus_ but then anger at myself that I got to the point of making others so uncomfortable to do so.   Although I haven't attended church since then_ I've kept the faith and im serious when I say only God has been able to provide the miracles that allowed me to get out of that situation and a bad job into a live-in caregiver job. That suv broke down the weekend before Dec 12_ 2022 when was fired from my secretary job at an investment firm because they were uncomfortable with my living situation (I had to be honest with them since they wondered why I was in the office on designated work from home days...) and they chalked it up to me ""not being a cultural fit.""   My anger towards their rejection of me motivated me to really scour Craigslist for room shares which is where I found a ""$0 live-in caregiver"" opportunity that I knew only God could provide. I still did the work by meeting the person in need of care_ and making a good impression to be accepted. The owner of the auto repair shop where my suv went to die (since I didn't have the money for a whole new engine!) felt so bad for me that he freaking bought me a used Honda Odyssey that one of his employees had for sale for $1k.   I share my own personal mini novel because as much as I empathize with the pain of the trauma and stress it is to be homeless: I promised God that I will only get better_ not bitter. That I will not become hard-hearted. That I will show compassion and be vulnerable sharing the truth of my situation because although some people reject me out of their own fear or bias: there are others who are compassionate and generous who will take the initiative to help when they become aware. I'm so grateful to both the fearful/selfish and the loving/giving because it brought me to today.   I remind myself_ ""forgive them_ they know not what they do."" And that this little chip I now have on my shoulder from this last year motivates me to ""live like no one else now (make sacrifices to live well beneath my means)_ so that later on I can live AND GIVE like no one else!""  Some people are sedated by worldly comforts that it's numbed them of empathy and compassion. I still wouldn't wish them to experience homelessness_ especially in isolation.

The US government and state governments hate homeless people as well. Seeing all the anti-homeless measures taken by the city to prevent you from even sitting down disgusts me to my core. Instead of improving overall conditions of life for citizens that have trouble providing they would rather just bar us from all kinds of places so they don't have to ""see"" us.

j4hi1wq,Wouldn’t even need to add on the extra months. I’d love nothing more for people to really grasp (because shit I think most of us didn’t grasp it either even as we were watching our situations fall apart) how once you’re homeless it all gets way harder than you’d ever think to turn it around. Like the point to truly help a homeless person and make the biggest difference in life is before they become homeless in the first place. The irony is it would probably be a lot more cost effective and keep people able to be functioning and contributing members of society without all the mental and physical health shit that hits fast and hard once you’re homeless.   I know I knew I was about to become homeless and I foolishly believed it would just take me a few months_ maybe 6_ to get back on my feet. Yeeeah. I had no freaking idea how bad it was going to get or how much everything about homelessness only compounds and keeps you down. It’s really hard if not impossible to put into words and really make someone understand without experiencing it. There’s always people (I see discussions like this all the time over in the poverty finance sub and want to shout “If it’s so easy why are you subscribed here?”) who talk this big game about how anyone can just bootstrap their way out of anything. I wanna ask those people have you tried doing it while disabled? While your teeth are rotting and you can hardly think straight from the pain but can’t afford dental care. When you haven’t had a place to lay head in weeks? When they tell you there’s a six month wait to even get a bed at the local shelter and you’re all out of places to turn? And on and on and on it spirals. Even if you luck into a vaguely decent social service org or your name comes up after freaking years on an affordable housing list there’s so many near impossible hoops you have to jump through even then.   If anything I’m continuously impressed by every success story I ever hear on this sub. It feels downright miraculous that anyone ever makes it back out of homelessness.,Tzipity,7,2,3,1530

j4mxg2k,I’ve been struggling with the exact same feelings.  Sometimes though_ the simplest_ simplest thing can turn me around.  Like getting a smile at the coffee shop_ or like_ I still do DoorDash because I’m immensely poor haha But a lady gave me $20 and seemed almost more shy about it than I was_ and I broke down crying in the car.  It was such a mix of feelings…a lot of it resentment at being put in a place where something like that makes me cry.  But I made myself stop_ and change my perspective.  I was able to feel such immense appreciation.  It js a beautiful_ beautiful thing.  The people who made me feel small_ and worthless_ will never_ ever feel such beauty.  And that made me rise up higher than they could ever be with just some money.  Anyway_ I try to change my perspective a lot_ it really does help.

They collapse mentally every day. This can't go on forever_ at some point_ they won't be able to continue functioning like this.  People typically retire because they got old. If you like your job_ you won't get sick of it.  I also think calling work ""slavery"" is problematic for numerous reasons. Before ""jobs"" existed_ people still had to work to fill their bellies. When people started specializing_ perhaps Alice went hunting but relied on Bob to maintain her weaponry_ while Bob didn't go hunting and so relied on Alice to keep him fed_ but nobody was forcing them to do this. Unless you're suggesting we all try to return to a hunting and gathering existence (which cannot possibly support even a tiny fraction of Earth's population of eight billion humans!) I don't think that makes sense.  Other advantages ""housed"" people (this includes apartments... I think ""unhoused"" is a stupid term) - you don't have to worry about where you will use the toilet_ you don't have to shower in a gym (or in a stream_ or not at all!). Privacy. Electricity. A generally safe place to keep your stuff so it doesn't get stolen.",InigoMontoya757,14,1,9,1231

j4e55g8,Currently housed.   Yeah having safety and shelter is terrible. Totally miss wondering around aimlessly_ carrying every thing I owned_ needed excuses for being inside.   Being constantly outside in the elements was a dream come true. There is no way I increased my chances of skin cancer from the 2nd and 3rd degree burns. The tip of left my ear is gone because I didn't want to come inside during that snow storm. *I mean_ who would?*   The best part was definitely the ~~long dark and lonely~~ nights being fully aware that if anyone decided to assault me I'd have no real way to legally defend myself.   Constantly being tired from barely sleeping was GREAT for all parts of my health. Always made my best decisions while sleep deprived.  Also if an assault landed in me getting pregnant I knew I'd have no way to take care of my body and what I'd be ***forced*** to carry. Being at much higher risk of complications that could kill both me and the thing inside of me. And if I was unlucky enough to survive_ and what was forced I to carry did not_ knowing that I could face serious charges.

j4kcq17,"So_ my apologies_ I'm autistic_ so I have difficulties expressing my thoughts. So_ please let me know if what I've written doesn't make any sense_ I'll try my best to clarify.   The suffering you're referring to isn't the fault of housing_ it's capitalism.  Because here's the thing_ if you didn't need to work your ass off at a dehumanizing job to own a home_ would having that home be that awful? There's nothing inherently oppressive about having a home (quite the opposite_ actually). Rather_ the fear of losing housing is used by the wealthy (employers_ landlords_ ect)_ to extract your time and labor.   At the same time_ the homeless are not spared from this oppression. They aren't free to create their own housing_ nor are they free to own a home of their liking. They are forced to survive without shelter_ and they are shamed for it. Society seeks to end their existence_ by depriving them of basic human needs. Survival is an all consuming job that provides no pay check for betterment. Not to mention_ many homeless do have jobs_ but those jobs don't have a livable wage. And yes_ many of those jobs would be considered an actual form of slavery. Ultimately_ the hard work of the homeless is done while being oppressed by cops_ and society at large. Often by vulnerable groups of people (PoC_ disabled_ victims of violence_ elderly_ pregnant individuals_ ect). The suffering and death of the homeless is used to keep housed workers obedient_ lest they endure the same.   We need to get rid of the mentality of ""It could've been worse!"" cause it doesn't do anything to improve our lives. Chuck it out_ and replace it with_ ""It could be better_ cause shit needs to get better.
10bu8u9,,j4kg0f2,The problem is that we live in a society. People have to get very uncomfortable to make the rest of society comfortable, people have to risk their lives to save others. No one can just rest and do nothing at all, we all have to contribute. I wouldn't mind doing stuff but it's just the over high pace of things and the unrealistic expectations workplaces have from their employers. I don't know if there can be a better society or what we have now is the best of all possible worlds. Either way, I hope there would be a right to die for people like us, so we could refuse the social contract.
10bu8u9,,j4naqns,I so relate to u. I would sign up for MAID because I can’t handle most work environments. I definitely don’t want to die but I can’t cope with the way things are set up.

10bs50o,,j4eyr88,I'm thankful that when I was homeless, I had a spot in a shelter during the time it was cold. Others weren't so lucky- that first Christmas, there was a Christmas Eve church service i attended, and part of it was remembering the homeless that had died in the past year. I don't remember any causes being mentioned, but some may have been due to the weather (hot or cold).  A lot of groups/people did offer cans of Sterno to those sleeping outside (or maybe inside, but without proper heating), and I imagine that helped at least a little

I do think some people are so mentally ill, so damaged, so hurt they purposely make everything dirty. I couldn’t handle poop all over my stuff and bed and I had to go home. Still trying to get out but don’t want to be homeless again.
10bredl,,j4gd53j,God what a nightmare :/ Can't get much worse than poop. Yeah sometimes the end goal is to hurt someone but it's a mental illness issue, people can be really traumatized and angry or it's a compulsion or something.

j49aqeh,A major one that is missed in a lot of packages is medication - things like pain relief_ UTI medications_ antibiotic cremes_ bandaids_ etc. Many of them come in bulk single packs. Depending on your location heat/cold packs (reusable or one-time use_ I use to let people warm up/freeze theirs when I ran a gas station).   Fleece can be okay depending on where you are_ but cheap fleece ones can get really damp and moldy in the wrong climate_ or frustratingly warm in others. Also depends on if they’re going to someone with a camp or are in the open. Someone with a camp or access to temporary housing can maintain blankets that soak water/stay wet longer much easier. I personally prefer to make and use dual sided with a soft wool on one side and a water resistant material on the other. Great because you can have the resistant on the outside if you’re sitting_ or facing down as a buffer from the ground cold/damp if you’re lying. Reinforced stitching and leaving one side unsewn was great because I could use them as a sleeping bag or cover_ stuff it with pillows_ or use it to carry other items. Blankets are always good though_ so don’t let any of that deter you if fleece is where it’s at for you! Just information from my experience.,godddamnit,3,1,3,1530

j49ggnz,The staff was stealing meds at the shelter I was at too. One guy even stole someone's new bank card when it arrived in the mail_ activated it and helped himself to all of her money. He got caught and she got her money back but it was like REALLY?  They would also steal anything valuable that they could going through the scanners. One woman lost her gold chains. Another had her laptop stolen right in front of her by a guard who took it saying it wasn't allowed. (It was.)   I had mine but I literally locked my bag so they couldn't take it when it went through the scanner and I kept it under my pillow at night_ locked to the bed. Took my backpack with me even to the bathroom.   The director of the first shelter I was at left right after I left. Word has it_ fired. I'm not surprised. That woman would literally take bags of candy that was brought for residents to enjoy at the holidays and stuff them in her big carry all right in front of us. She'd take it all home with her. She'd give us like one piece and abscond with the rest of it she was so cheap.   Meds vanished nearly every day. A lot of the staff that worked there were ex-homeless or were there working while on probation. They paid them so little that they felt the stealing was justifiable.   The food thing_ half rations_ and expired food being given to us_ that was what really bothered me. I am convinced that the now former director was pocketing money meant for the residents food because when I got to the second shelter the food wasn't much better but there was WAY more of it and we were allowed to eat a lot more_ especially at breakfast.   At the first shelter you'd be lucky to get some eggs and one little breakfast sausage OR a little bowl of cereal and maybe a half rotted banana. In the second shelter we got full eggs and 3 sausages_ 2 cereal bowls_ as many pieces of fruit as we wanted_ and there would be waffles or pancakes too a lot of the time.   The first time I saw the breakfast buffet I was like OMG because it was a positive feast compared to what I was used to at the first shelter. Other meals too. You could take 2 meals if you wanted. The food was still rotten for lunch and dinner_ same providers_ but you could just take extra cereal or waffles or whatever and not starve because you couldn't eat lunch or dinner.   They didn't have a clothes closet there because by then we were actually in hotels but I will bet you that back at the actual shelter they were outfitting people not selling off clothes to resellers. I did lose a pair of boots that came in the mail there though. They just up and vanished and never made it into my hands and the mailman did confirm that someone downstairs did receive them.   I was rather ticked but the person on desk duty that day just denied ever having a package for me that day. I had to let it go but I did rather hope she got horrible blisters and those boots made her absolutely miserable. 👅  In my mind you have to be pretty low to steal from homeless people in a shelter. Or to half starve them and give them potentially dangerous food that's out of date and that you have re-tagged as fresh when it's not. To limit old people who need diapers to one or two a day. To steal personal belongings and medications from people who have practically nothing.   It happens though_ all the time.,mtempissmith,6,2,9,1231

Their solution? Give it away to ""someone who'll appreciate it"". I.e. dump this problem on someone else so I don't have to pay for a dumpster. As according to them_ ""this stuff is still worth at least half of what I paid for it. Look at it_ its practically still new!"" As they show you that 20 year old prom dress with the stains on it. Unable to comprehend that not even the homeless are going to want to lug around a stained_ or even new prom dress formerly worth 300$ (Because what would you even do with it if your homeless? You can't even attend interviews in it_ and it'll get ruined at the bottom of your pack. Its dead weight at that point for a population that mainly lives mobile).      Not to mention even new things of value_ like a car engines and fine oak dressers that they think are of value to the homeless to sell_ are also worthless to donate_ as no homeless person even has a place to store these things until they find a buyer_ so what is it to them other than more dead weight? (Especially when it comes to things like old couches and furniture. Yes_ your sofa only has a small tear on it and is perfectly good_ but whose going to buy and old couch from the 90's off your for 100$ when Ikea will sell you one new for 200$ minus the hassle of bartering? Hell_ how's a homeless person supposed to sell a couch?)   And so the charity center then begrudgingly either takes their offer or tosses it for them. The hoarder/Donater then walks away feeling stellar with themselves as they've given away what they view as a 1000$ dollar deal for free to their local homeless_ who can obviously make fantastic use out of it. When then reality is not even the homeless want your old suit with a missing collar piece or old wedding dress with wine sunk into it_ as although these items are expensive to acquire_ for what it will cost to restore them (150$ something dollar alterations)_ nobody shopping at the local homeless shelter could ever afford to_ or has the resources to re-store/repair them. And so they will wait until they are no longer homeless to go buy these types of items new from the store_ leaving the donated goods to wind up right where you'd expect_ the trash.",Icy-Weather2164,1,1,3,1530

Another solution is to do what a normal_ housed person might do: get a safety deposit box.

You \*do\* avoid other homeless people_ and you are in a literal position to (sitting on a seat inside a closed metal and glass box with rubber tires) avoid them.  As you are in your car 90% of the day_ you aren't out interacting with other homeless people... you are instead in your car.  >I avoid people who are obviously dangerous or potentially threatening.  This makes up the leading edge of the homeless ""bubble"" in your area.  If you drive around_ and try to spot and notice all the homeless people... and you were able to keep an accurate count... you'd find that you are seeing about 1/4th to 1/5th of the total number of homeless people in that area.  The vast majority of homeless people stay out of the public eye_ or don't \*appear\* to be homeless.  It is a **minority** of the total number of homeless who are mentally ill or substance abusers_ and it is a minority of the total number of homeless who are dangerous or potentially threatening.  HOWEVER... if you are **only** talking about the homeless who regularly put themselves in positions of interacting with the general homed population... that 1/4th or 1/5th you see on the streets... then_ the number of predators_ dangerous individuals_ mentally ill and substances abusers becomes a majority.  Just to throw numbers at this.  If there's 1000 homeless in an area_ you'd probably see 200 of them around town in public (or public-ish) areas.  The other 800 would have their particular way of not being seen_ or not being seen as one of the homeless.  If 125 of those 200 were dangerous_ or substance abusers_ or mentally ill...  that would certainly give the impression that **most** of the homeless in that area were dangerous_ or substance abusers_ or mentally ill... even though it is an impression created by only 125 people out of 1000.  Yes_ it would be hypocritical if you were to avoid homeless people_ when you yourself were very aware of how people avoid you due to your homeless status.  However_ you aren't letting cold homeless people into your car to warm up either.  And... are you actually avoiding being this interactive in your homeless community because you are avoiding ""homeless"" people?  I don't think so.  And that's why I don't believe you are being a hypocrite.  You aren't avoiding people **because** they are homeless... you are avoiding predatory and dangerous people_ who also happen to be homeless.  And they just happen to be homeless... since the pool of people you have to choose from that you can be social with_ is limited by your own homeless status.  If everyone around you is covered in mud_ you can't blame being covered in mud for why one of them screws you over.  I'm not saying you are.

Switch to consistently telling em you have no plan_ and actively enjoy thinking about the possibilities in your future. It helps to smile a bunch and pretend to get along with the other patients.

j42rrye,I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this. I’m in a somewhat similar situation leaving an abusive relationship and just collecting an endless pile of shit ever since. There’s too many of us with stories like this. And if your abusive situation isn’t clear cut (like a spouse or partner versus other people in your life- think I saw from one of your comments that your situation was more complex. Mine too) or you’re already out of it you tend not qualify for any of domestic violence shelters or assistance.   Soul crushing is the perfect word for it and I get even more upset hearing other peoples stories and knowing I’m not unique in this.   I’m not the best at chatting up strangers but legit if you need to vent or want to chat hit me up. And either way- I hope you keep fighting and have some better luck soon.

j3wl0dh,736 homeless died in Phoenix Arizona in 2022. That number doesn’t include the 450 that were not categorized correctly. I was homeless in June and July here and had to stay at a shelter. There are so many programs for the homeless here but you have to follow rules or you get kicked out. It’s impossible for addicts to follow the rules so live in The Zone in tents and die from overdoses of fentanyl_ dehydration etc. It was horrible and scary in the shelter. I was sexually assaulted in my sleep by another woman. That wasn’t bad enough for her to get kicked out though. Our state makes billions of tax dollars off marijuana sales and I would like to see some of it help the addicts get into a safe place. Fentanyl abuse is so rampant here they even smoke it on train and bus. Most bud stops are just drug dens. It’s impossible to avoid in the areas of town with shelters. The city isn’t doing anything about it.  https://www.12news.com/amp/article/news/local/arizona/hundreds-more-people-experiencing-homelessness-dying-in-maricopa-county-this-year-than-last/75-a3738b73-b3c0-44f6-b12a-f274af474ec7,IronicBunny,3,5,3,1530

j3u752e,As with any program that targets disabled_ it will depend upon personal finances_ resources_ and what the state/federal guidelines are. Simply being disabled doesn't mean you automatically get anything. The major difference between disabled and able bodied_ for me_ was that my state gives me a longer period of receiving food stamps without needing to reapply as often. I still have to report any income changes_ including rent changes. I still have to re-apply by my renewal date. I still can be denied for food stamps. I just don't have to re-apply every three months_ just once a year.  Other programs_ unless specifically for disabled or elderly_ are going to be just as likely to have program restrictions that may be only slightly looser than for able bodied. In fact_ some can be MORE restrictive for disabled/elderly_ because you may gain in one area_ but then lose in another. I gained 8.7% for a cost of living increase. That put me too high to continue to get free health care. Now_ I'll likely easily eat away the extra money by needing to pay co-pays and deductibles. I would have preferred to not have that extra 8.7%_ because my medical issues can cost me more in the long term.,unwillingvictim,3,1,3,1530

j3yj1xy,It’s awesome you’re working on what you are. My parents are much older than the norm (they were 46 and 51 when they had me!) so at this point they’re basically in their 80s and not doing well but even before that point weren’t supportive.   Really interesting point about the institutionalization thing. Because in many ways the reason I’m homeless was my refusal to go to a nursing home. My favorite part was a doctor who insisted I could not possibly continue to receive the life sustaining treatments while homeless. So she painted nursing home as the only option. Well_ she was wrong. I’m getting that treatment. But it also means I can’t stay in a regular shelter. It’s absolute rock and a hard place.   I also hopped states in this mess and am the top of the list suddenly for a supportive housing unit for disabled and homeless folks in the state im not currently in and they’re pushing me to get over there and sign paperwork and I’m not even sure I can and it’s all just ugggggggh. And I have long lived with that terror that if you don’t have family to care for you_ there really isn’t anything else. So part of me realizes even if I finally find my way out of the mess I’m in now that fear will never leave. I’ll always be half a step away from exactly what’s happened now.   Anyway. Totally rambling. It’s been so freaking hard though because it’s like what little disability assistance does exist or the options for homeless folks in general don’t really work for my needs. So I’m treading and spinning circles getting nowhere. It’s really gross that societally we’re happy to throw the most vulnerable amongst us to the wolves basically.,Tzipity,1,3,3,1530
j4f49ik,Appreciate it. It's definitely a struggle. The biggest thing that the accessible housing development comes down to is cost_ and that's hard to get around without more federal funding. That and time. It took us decades to get into this housing crisis (even before we were building with disabled folks in mind) and it will take us decades to get out of it most likely. I'm sorry to hear about your parents. Between them not doing well and not being supportive is tough. I'm very glad and fortunate my parents have been nothing but supportive.  Yes_ exactly! No young person with a disability wants to have to live in a nursing home. Not being ageist_ but being segregated from peers your age is devastating. It's one thing if it's multigenerational (which I think it should be_ because siloing away our elders is also bullshit)_ but if you're literally the only person below retirement age (or younger) that must be so isolating.  How come you can't stay in a shelter while doing this treatment? Or is it just not accessible enough?  I like the concept of universal design - that is_ making spaces usable to greatest extent possible by the most number of people as possible. I think we should apply this philosophy to all buildings so that we don't have to retroactively make shit accessible. Just do it from the beginning. It may be more expensive upfront_ but in the long run it will save time_ money_ and resources. To your point about being thrown to the wolves_ we don't do this because as a market society we're too focused on short term profits and gains. We used to make buildings that were built to last and carefully crafted to fit their community. Form followed function. Anyway_ thanks for coming to my TED Talk lol.  Ah I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through right now. I hope you can figure out something soon. I wish I could help somehow.

j3uaoig,If you have a therapist_ talk to them about getting Prissy documented as your ESA (Emotional Support Animal). ESA's can be any type of cat_ unlike the dogs and mini horses that are considered true support animals. ESA's have the same housing rights_ although hotels and motels are not required to allow them to stay. But you can't be denied housing due to an ESA_ and ESA's can't be charged as pets (no pet deposits_ no pet rent_ but you can be held responsible for any damage_ if caused by the ESA). They are considered medical equipment_ but don't have public access (can be denied entry into public buildings like theatres_ restaurants_ stores_ etc).  If you can get her documented_ then it makes it much easier to get her into an apartment. There are four exceptions to ESA housing_ but it's the same as for those with service animals as well. Your primary care doctor may agree to document her_ but therapists are preferred_ since they are EMOTIONAL support_ rather than physical support. Just talk to the therapist_ and explain how much better your quality of life is since you got her. My therapist saw that_ even without me directly talking about it_ and offered to document my cat before I could ask. The paperwork should just need to be on the doctors letterhead_ with the confirmation that you have a cat ESA_ and have the doctors contact information provided. It should be dated_ and my apartments have accepted it as long as it was less than a year old.

If she was evicted from ""public housing""_ that can make it hard for her to get a subsidized ""senior"" apartment_ which might otherwise be her best bet: [https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=project+based+senior+housing+somerset+ky](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=project+based+senior+housing+somerset+ky)  If she could get a low-income ""senior"" apartment_ you might not be able to live with her_ since you're 18_ unless as a live-in caregiver.  I would advise finding a shelter that can serve as a conduit to services to answer her and your immediate needs_ connect with a social worker or adviser_ etc. Unfortunately_ that might mean finding a home for your ""kitty"". Does your granny belong to a church? If yes_ try them.

j3x7pwz,If your grandma has a hoarding problem_ then see if you can get a storage unit for her belongs and talk with your current landlord and make a deal that you will work on it. Sometimes_ explaining your situation and working with people changes everything. Maybe if the landlord sees you are going to help your grandma and clean the house she will allow you both to stay.  Look up prices at Public Storage_ and see if you can put your grandma’s things in there.  If you donate plasma you can make enough money to cover the storage unit for your grandmothers belongings.  Your grandma has a mental illness that is making her hoard. I think you should talk with her and explain she can keep the stuff_ but it has to be in the storage unit and the house has to be clean_ because you don’t want to get kicked out.

j3vzsck,Try to look for other options if you have them even if it's not a perfect situation_ I lived in a household with an older brother that was the worst bully you could imagine. I did martial arts my whole childhood including Jiu-Jitsu while my two older brothers became Golden Glove boxers.  Anytime I would say something back my father would tell me to be quiet and show respect to my older brothers then when they started bullying especially the one about_ he would always tell me to handle it myself.  One day after being slapped in the face probably as hard as he could slap I choked him just barely into unconsciousness with absolutely zero effort_ the other brother jumped up but decided he didn't want to get choked then my dad told me to leave the house.  I stayed in my vehicle for approximately a week until a family member offered me a room if I could help with rent.

Good news is…you’ve got some options_ seek out resources wisely.  If you do run into trouble_ hopefully you’re in a blue city and they seem to be trying to avoid the “felony” charges by handing out misdemeanors instead (I believe the city mayors have this amount of authority).  It’s odd_ I don’t really understand it_ but its just as they say…politics…I was actually reading about where a certain blue city mayor in TN was having a discussion with the Chief of Police about the issue and he told the mayor this…if they get calls to come out and see about someone camping illegally…they have to carry out the law and make the arrest.   Wild stuff eh?.,missfire23,3,1,3,1530
j3ux95l,I'm sorry that your brother and dad are treating you unfairly. I used to be a case manager_ and I can try to help you look up resources. I have a few questions:  1) Do you mind sharing your age? There might be shelters in your area for homeless youth. Where I live_ these shelters accept people between the ages of 18-25.    2) Are you attending some school or educational program? This could be K-12_ community college_ university_ or technical programs. Your school might offer special services or grants to support you.     3) Do you have any friends that you can stay with for the time being? Even if they don't have room right now_ maybe they could offer you a safe place to park overnight? I'm glad that your boyfriend is offering to let you shower_ laundry_ etc. at his place_ even if you can't live with him for now.     4) Do you have any nearby relatives that can help you? I saved this for last because it could be tricky depending on their relationships with your dad and/or brother.  It might be helpful to ask if you can stay with a friend or a relative for a specific amount of time (like 2 weeks_ 2 months_ etc) until you can find a job and a place to live.  5) There might be a resource hotline in your county or state that provides referrals to community programs_ like shelters for homeless people_ domestic violence survivors_ LGBT_ etc. Even if these shelters don't have space right now_ they might be able to offer cash assistance or motel vouchers so you can stay in a motel for a couple nights for free.   I'm sorry again for what you're going through. You deserve to be treated with respect by your brother. Regardless of you and your brother's age_ your father is still your parent and should act like one in difficult situations like this. I'm taking a guess that your dad is passive or tends to bend to your brother's will_ which is unacceptable. Especially when it gets to this point where you're leaving your house... He defend your brother_ but you are also his child and worthy of respect and healthy boundaries.   To end on a positive note_ I am happy to hear that your boyfriend is trying his best to be supportive. His parents might not let you live with them now_ but they might change their mind in the future. I'm glad that you are trying to better your life and leave your toxic home environment. Not everyone has the courage and support to leave a negative situation. Best of luck_ and my DMs are open.  *Quick update*: Sorry_ I misread your post and thought you had a car. I think it might be more urgent to call the resource line or domestic violence shelters near you. I'm guessing from your avatar that you may be a woman (my apologies if I'm incorrect). Many DV shelters accept women_ and some accept people of all genders (but unfortunately_ it's not as common). I recommend DV shelters because you might be moved to a small house or apartment complex_ instead of a general homeless shelter than could be more dangerous and filled with more people. I think this is an emergency_ so I really hope the shelter hotline can find a bed for you tonight - honestly_ I think they might give you a motel voucher because most shelters are impacted (at full capacity).,ribbitfrog,1,1,3,1530

j3s0z6g,Any coast has major storms and even the middle of the country isn't immune. My Mom's family my great grandfather built a big farmhouse in Kansas City and it stood for nearly a hundred years but one bad tornado and it was history.   The tornado literally flattened the house and everything in it was gone. The only reason my Grandmother on that side survived was because she went into the cellar.   Everything was smashed except oddly this porcelain egg that was kind of a family heirloom. I still have that now even though a tree fell on my house and destroyed it. It's remarkable that it's made it through two natural disasters that egg.   Mama Nature can get you wherever you live. If it's not storms then it's earthquakes or floods or fires or volcanos. Nobody is ever completely  safe from a potential natural disaster really.   One guy I knew he bought a house with his wife and it turned out the house was built on a huge snake nest. All Winter they were fine_ just digging their new house but come Spring they had freaking snakes everywhere_ including a bunch of cooperheads.   They had to move out and they sued the former owner for non disclosure. 250K house and they couldn't live in it without it crawling with snakes when it was warm.   Stuff happens. It's just life. Look at what's happening out in California right now. Even rich people like Oprah are having to vacate their homes because of major flooding. A few months ago it was forest fires.

I get that it might feel bad at first_ but you’re very young and should know this: sometimes as a woman you have to be a bitch to get your point across to someone who is taking advantage. And if you can’t be assertive here_ you need to get a big/ strong/ tall/ intimidating male friend or family member to physically demand that he leaves and never comes back.   You aren’t his guardian Angel_ and he clearly doesn’t give a shit about you or your sense of safety or dignity. Stand up for yourself and realize he isn’t a lost kitten_ he’s a manipulative pervert who happens to be experiencing homelessness.   And mind you I am only talking about this specific man—I think in general it is great to be kind_ but you have to know to set boundaries when people show you who they are. Not everyone is as kind as you.,OnWarmLeatherette,6,1,3,1530
j3wrdbc,Holy shit_ sorry that happened. I think we were all kinda hoping he’d continue to be respectful but I guess not. Good for you for dealing it with it so we’ll!!,musichearts,2,1,3,1530
j499oyw,Call the cops without warning him. Let the cops know he has been told to leave multiple times . Let them know he exposes himself and jacks off in front of you. Don't warn him.  Cops may not be able to do much the first time_ but after if you have to call again it will be on record and he won't be able to bypass trespassing twice.   If you get lucky he may even have warrants.   This guy sounds dangerous. All your doing now is pissing him off.,AngelicDevilz,3,1,3,1530
j3obwrd,Lol maybe this is a sign to take his advice and get a large dog and a gun. And you can also take precautions to make your doors more secure_ just google them. And if the intruder doesnt have a gun themselves_ usually they'll run at the first sight of one. Except they cant run cause you'll have a big ass dog 😆  As far as your neighborhood_ 99% of people outside will leave you alone and would greatly appreciate your assistance_ but if you're worried about the 1% (and I dont mean that sarcastically) then I would invest in some mace and/or a CCW. If the one guy in particular is bothering you_ just be direct without being disrespectful and ask him nicely to  go to a shelter. You could even offer to take him there. But I would say its not safe to let a stranger who's asking invasive questions and knows all of your schedules to stay literally at your back porch. Plus 3/4 of you are women? Yeah nah fuck that. Sorry but you have to ensure your own safety first.,TheQuietFall,14,1,3,1530
j3oc2ry,Nah; you've been as accommodating as any stranger has a right to expect.    As to the 'best way_' of course it depends on the individual_ but for the most part I tend to just prefer being talked to as an equal_ or as close to it as circumstances allow.  You said that some of his comments were scaring you.  Coming from the other side_ what could **he** have done differently to be less of an imposition on you?,capsaicinintheeyes,13,1,3,1530
j3pc5f1,You sound like very decent people. Keep being decent. Talk to him_ as a group_ and find out what his deal is. Explain that you allowed him to stay while the weather was terrible but he must move on now. If you have something that can help him_ offer it. Treat him like a human being and give him the chance to act like one. If he starts to behave badly_ then escalate. Not before. Good luck and thanks for being kind.,grckalck,19,1,9,1231

j3orulx,> today he asked if we had any dogs in the house (we don’t) and he said “What_ no guardians?”.  Oh_ jeez...  I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt here and assume this guy is just clueless when it comes to interacting with people. So I'd probably try use that as a way to start a longer conversation with him. Like_ walk by his camp with at least one of your other roommates and try to catch his attention_ then bring it up and tell him how saying things like that comes across to a young woman. After that_ keep the conversation going and really try to figure out what kind of person he is. He may be a very good guy_ in which case it can be a benefit to have him staying there if your place is a thoroughfare. That may even be what he was hoping to say with the guardian comment_ however badly it came out.  If you keep getting bad vibes_ though_ then you just have to ask him to leave. Personally_ I never call the cops under any circumstances_ but I get it if you feel you need to. But maybe consider going down as a group (all four of you that live there) and asking him about it. Try to think of this as mutual support for each other_ not a way to intimidate him. And try to remember that no one's all bad (or all good)_ we're just complicated.  Good luck and stay safe. This is not an easy situation_ but I think you're being really thoughtful about it_ which is great.,AdeepinAmerica,18,1,3,1530

j3rgzej,I don't like it.  As the time gets friendlier_ intentions can become more sinister. The comment on the guardians is very concerning.  I think if I was in your position. I think you and your roommates should nicely talk to him of his intentions. Then I think you should tell him almost exactly what you shared here.  That it's sorta a pass through spot. And that they like it that way_ so they can help others as well. but I would be honest and tell him it's about time to start thinking about moving on.  If you get a lot of kickback. Then I would mention how his comment about guardians has everyone uneasy_ that your not assuming anything but ask him to put himself in ur shoes. Lots of homeless are really empathic_ good_ kind_ accepting people.  I think that's how some of them simply survive by being agreeable.  Lots of opinions_ and their like assholes.

j3qi0ke,You mentioned that this guy has been there for a couple of days because it's warm and it's snowing. I've been homeless and out on the street one time during a snow storm. I found any place that was warm enough for me to stay. And if someone came along that 'not another homeless guy's look. A simple 'excuse me'' from me meant I'm not THAT type of homeless...and they would ask am I alright.  Do not call the cops. Talk to him like a human being and ask him that you have some people who might be coming over or whatever. Mention a shelter... But winter time_ they fill up fast and turn people away.   You also mentioned that others just past thru_ eat and smoke there too. Is it dirty_ do you have to clean it up yourself? If it's not dirty and you aren't cleaning it or no one in the house isn't cleaning it... What does that say. That your house is cool_ don't leave your mess garbage on their back area because they are somewhat allowing us to do our thing.

j3j06mj,Agreed. Also_ this might sound fluffy and silly but it isn’t: People need connection and friendship. Unsheltered people_ especially those who have substance use disorders_ have burnt many if not all of their bridges_ and surviving on the street is hard_ there are not many people who are out to help or who won’t harm them even. So striking up a real_ non transactional friendship with somebody can help you discover how to really help that person. Of course_ you can’t do that with every person you encounter on the street_ but certainly with one or two. Try it!

j3ht14m,I'n not discouraging you from doing something more_ by all means_ any help is beneficial_ but imo if you want a personal touch_ talk to them. Have an actual conversation. Ask them what they need. Pick the amount of money you're giving them based on what they tell you.      If they say they need $100 to make it through to the end of the month_ and you then give them that $100 (or more if you're feeling generous)_ it doesn't get much more personal than that. You're likely to make someone cry of happiness_ depending on how hard their situation is at the time. You may literally be saving their life.,Soulegion,9,2,3,1530

j3kduf6,Yeah. Even if I ever got anything like $20 or more the majority wasn't going to substances at all.

Socks_ lighter_ clothing from the thrift store_ toiletries_ coffee so I can sit inside when it rains. I'd never blow $20 just to get high if somebody gave that to me. It's a waste and it's short lived. If I really want to party I'll go do some temp labor and even then I'm not spending all my money on garbage. It's nice to feel like a human being and have a breakfast_ coffee_ and a cigarette or two. Although I'll never turn down free alcohol if somebody is cool to hang out with.

j42yd1h,"Sometimes. Sometimes you're so far gone that you can't make a good decision literally to save your own life_ let alone to keep your immediate area tidy. You don't see the needles/trash/piss bottles/poop of the people who do it right. Heck some of the people are picking up the slack for other people. Their disregard for keeping the community clean is just as irksome to other homeless people as it is to everyone else_ but the problem gets blamed on ""the homeless"". Even illegal dumping from housed people gets lumped in with ""the homeless.""  I guarantee_ nobody in that tent encampment has a blue velvet couch or a bunch of used sheetrock. (Well_ I guess they do *now*)  There's people just as messy as ""Needles On The Ground"" guy_ but they get to hide their mess inside homes where you don't see them. Sometimes you'll see the insides of their cars. Sometime you'll see the aftermath of an avalance of trash getting kicked out of the foot well as they go to get more fast food.  There's all kinds of reasons people littler. If we solved problems that lead people to living on the street and/or becoming addicted to drugs and had better resources for those people that didn't involve things like ""a place to sleep_ but you have to get rid of all your stuff"" or ""free drug treatment_ but if you're addicted to drugs we kick you out"" as sure we'd solve the problems of people who don't deserve it_ but hey_ you wouldn't have needles on the street to step over. You deserve that right?  Now what really bakes my noodle is when I see a pile of purposely bent needles. Here is a person who was considerate enough to render their used needle inoperable so it can't be reused by someone else_ to avoid spreading disease.

There’s quite a difference (rather large) between a “Recreational Activity that’s planned” (Somehow 100% are not leaving any trace) and what you are assuming as those who happen to be homeless_ who definitely are 100% at fault for all trash found in the vicinity of wherever they are).,missfire23,1,3,3,1530

Aren't the ones that threw living room furniture and mattresses into the drainage ditches of my town_ which contributed significantly to the damage caused during the Father's Day flood a few years back.   It was the people who live in houses_ and owned trucks to take their garbage out and dump at sites they figured didn't matter.   It was out of sight and out of mind - until it wasn't.   The homeless individuals in your city? Don't have a monopoly of creating trash and drug abuse_ but they're less able to defend themselves_ and it's socially acceptable to assume they're the problem_ so you are.  You say you really wanted to help the homeless population...so are you providing them a way to throw out trash? It's funny to me that municipalities will hold spring clean-ups and rent dumpsters for neighborhoods a couple times a year_ but for some reason giving the homeless a place to throw out trash that's maintained is often considered ""enabling"" them.   Also? Not every homeless person is a drug addict. There are plenty of people in houses throwing their drug-relates trash and needles out in inappropriate places_ too. Again_ the homeless are just an easy scapegoat to blame.   Do you have a needle exchange program that is advertised and accessible? If not_ then you're more interested in placing blame than helping.   There are SO many solutions to this problem that aren't hateful and biased - all of which I would've tried before complaining to homeless people online about the homeless.

j3i9reb,"OP_ the best way to understand the connection between trash_ hoarding_ self-medication/addiction_ illness_ sex work_ violence_ and survival skills that don't work in housing with extreme poverty/homelessness is to consider it _trauma information_.  The best example of this understanding is in Victor Hugo's fictional novel Les Miserables (Bishop Myriel). After Jean Valjean robs the bishop of all of his silverware_ is captured by the police_ and is returned to face the bishop_ Myriel understands completely that theft is merely a means of survival for those who have nothing.  His response? ""...you forgot_ I said to take the candlesticks also.""  That's great that your city provides a modicum of support for people experiencing homelessness.

My experiences with homelessness were all rooted in not having safe people or a safe family. Coming from abuse predisposes you to a whole host of things_ including falling into more unsafe relationships. And since housing isn't treated as a right in the US_ it is very easy to slip through the cracks.  (also unrelated but wanted to pass along that gypsy is historically a slur unless you're romani_ in which case ignore me.

Their society and culture does place an emphasis on families and filial duties_ etc.  You can have communism_ and Neighbors and children will inform on their parents and get them imprisoned_ lose their jobs_ get sent to re-education camps_ etc.  Ultimately_ the booming opportunities of the post-WWII era when America was factory to the world meant people could live on minimum wage and still manage having a home on their own due to lower population densities. That was short-lived.  But with mechanization_ automation_ computerization reducing the need for labor_ and exponentially growing population due to reproduction_ people living longer_ urbanization_ migration_ and immigration_ thus growing labor supply and housing demand_ we now see low wages_ unemployment_ underemployment_ skyrocketing housing costs.

I'm just pointing out that such phrasing *is* used as a right-wing dogwhistle_ and that such phrasing might elicit reactions that reflect such.   As far as psychology vs sociology_ I don't think the line between social constructs and personal actions is a very thick line. There is almost always a trickle down (or up_ depending on how you look at it) effect between how society behaves as a whole and how individuals within that society behave.   My MA is in interdisciplinary humanities_ so I did a lot of studying on how these different approaches to knowledge intersect_ and even directly interact_ with each other. When people suggest that one discipline is strictly separate from another (within the humanities at least_ which includes both psychology and sociology_ and many more disciplines) they have often simply forgotten to see the forest for the trees.,happycowsmmmcheese,4,4,8,1024

I don't remember us timing anyone so you could shower and relax.   I don't remember if the one with the bathtub was extra or not_ I doubt it was extra. We would clean and sanitize after every person as truckers expect them to be spotless for what they're paying (showers are free for truckers if they get a certain amount of diesel but still.)  The only bad thing about truck stop showering is sometimes they can be a royal pain in the ass to get to and from one with how they're usually on a highway. Though they often need help and you could probably get a job at one and shower at the next closest one and they're usually relatively close to one another.  You could try googling *truck stop shower nearby* and call them and ask if they have showers at the location before making the trip out there. Maybe there is one closer than you realized.    Best luck I hope you find a clean warm tub waiting for you.,kaosmoker,6,2,12,1488

j3e1s5r,In a technical sense you **are** a criminal. I’m not trying to say you are a bad person or anything_ I’m just making a point.

I don’t know why_ but it bothers me when a term like “criminal” is used as a stand in for bad or dangerous person.

They hung out off and on for a week til I moved my camp because I don't like anyone knowing where I sleep outside.   Another time I tried to treat a methhead like a human being and they tried to rob me at knifepoint I had to pull a Dundee maneuver with my 15-inch kukri and he luckily wasn't desperate enough to want to take it any further and left me in peace.   I know everyone's experiences are different but I've only met a couple shitty power-hungry cops in all my travels.

I was walking in the snow for hours and then fell asleep on the bench at a bus station because I was hungry and exhausted. When I woke up_ a stranger gave me some food. I kept walking towards the seaside_ hoping to end my life there. I got distracted by a noodle soup restaurant - they were smoking some pork_ which smelled very tempting. I walked into the restaurant begging for food_ and the owner gave me some. I asked him to work there in exchange for food and a place to sleep_ and he agreed. I chopped garlics gingers and onions_ scraped grease from pots and stoves_ and wiped toilets and floor. After four days_ someone called the social service as I stink and looked like shit. Family picked me up and took me home_ and almost beat me to death.   So yeah_ I would say family owned restaurants may be able to offer some help.

j3gds5o,I have done what you're doing now. A couple of pointers_ if you don't mind. Perhaps they're redundant_ but I'll throw them out there_ in case something can help. Always have at least two sources of light. You can get a decent flashlight from Walmart for 99 cents. Always_always_always have some fresh water. You cannot have too many socks. Never_ ever set your campsite near the road. Move back into the woods a good ways to a fairly isolated spot. This will help protect you from both thieves and cops. Make sure to note landmarks_ so you can find your way back to your camp. (This is Critical!) Never leave anything in your camp that you can't afford to lose. Pack out all electronics_ all documentation_ and a change of clothes every single time you leave. Go to the local Social Services_ or apply on line for EBT/SNAP benefits. This will guarantee a food supply regardless of actual money. Don't trash your campsite. Haul out your garbage each day when you head out. This may sound vanilla_ but trashy disgusting littered sites do a lot to foster prejudice against the homeless. Be the exception_ not the stereotype.  In wintertime_ (like_ now) set up your sleeping bag so it is above the ground. This can be done with bowers_ an air mattress_ (pain in the ass. You need a pump to inflate it. But_ still worth it.) or pallets (the most efficient and economic.) The winter ground will suck the heat out of you faster than anything but freezing water. Avoid direct contact if possible. Keep enough money saved to replace your tent_ sleeping bags_ and some clothes in case you get robbed. As you wander_ always scope out alternate places to set up camp. Take the time when you can to explore them. Keep a mental list of places you could relocate to if needed. Trust your instincts. If things seem off somehow_ if people are getting too close to your camp_ or if things nearby are getting hairy_ don't hesitate to move. We have a natural territoriality that you must resist. You have no territory. The world is your home. You must camp where the tranquility is_ and avoid conflict. Move when necessary_ and do  not delay. Your life does actually depend on it.  Don't tell anyone you're homeless. Other than social workers. Homelessness instantly changes the way people view you. And not in good way. Is it fair_ or just? No. But it is the reality of your situation_ and you must accept it_ or suffer.  Did I mention fresh water? And socks? Anyway_ I hope this didn't seem preachy or pedantic. Just trying to help. Good luck to you. I hope everything works out well in the end. Feel free to pm me if needed.,xX_Ogre_Xx,3,1,9,1231

j3gaie9,I keep a backpack primed and ready after I aged out of foster care and had to figure out on my own how to make it.   I spent my 20s traveling the USA as a nomad. It was terrifyingly enlightening_ and then I learned what tools make life simpler.   Anymore I work off and on as necessary only to pay for the luxuries i want. I spent so much time outside it's like a second home. Being homeless is more an inconvenience than a terrifying situation anymore. Working hard doesn't get you again anymore sadly.   In the right places_ you can live pretty comfortably outdoors once you get used to not having all the luxury of constant electricity_ running water_ and a toilet.   I recommend scouting out a few places no less than 100 yards from anything else. Keep an eye out for branches that could fall on you. If there is any trash or anything it's a no go. People go there.   Get you a Silcock key_ it will give you access to water spigots on the outside of businesses so you can rinse off and get hose-quality water to fill your water bottle. Make sure to relock and tightly shut back off so you're not drawing unnecessary attention.    3 or more ways to make fire. BIC lighter_ tiki torch_ denatured alcohol_ practice how to make a Dakota fire hole_ fire starters_ matches_ fatwood. when it gets down to deadly Temps your fingers don't work right and the fire seems to refuse to take on a life of it's own.   Clear plastic drop cloth works better to cover a shelter better than a tarp it keep water from dripping thru. Emergency blanket-styled sleeping bag. 3 feet or more of leaves is needed for insulation.  I prefer to make a primitive shelter and then dig a fox hold under it with a pocket in a corners filled with small rocks for any water that runs in to collect. It takes time but tossing rocks on fhe bottom keeps things cleaner as you don't have to worry about mud so much. The dirt I get from the hole goes on top mixed with leaves to add insulation and make it look like a rough hill. I've carved a bench/chair and a mini fireplace.  Hygiene is a huge deal_ it can cost you your job and your life. Keep a gallon jug of water for washing off. A cheap bar of laundry soap is useful for keeping clothes clean in a stream so you don't have to lug clothes to the laundry mat and spend money there. Clean boxers and socks shouldn't be a luxury. Wash your hands and face every chance you get. It's surprising how quickly dirt can collect and make you look dirty. Baby wipes are wonderful for this.   Dumpster diving is a way to get meat in colder months.   You can bury a ice chest so when the lid is placed the chest is just below flush with the ground with dirt on top. Fill with ice regularly and you can keep some food and not have to live on less desirable food.   With some rope and a bag you can fill it and submerge it 3 feet or more into a a body of water and it will keep meat and milk good for days. Cereal is something I enjoy sometimes and where there's a will there's a way.   I know loads of tricks to make living outside very comfortable if anyone has specific questions feel free to ask.   Temp agencies are a life saver as well. They can offer day labor without the sketchiness. So you can make some cash.   I will say don't get busted digging on_ or sleep in a hole on someone else's land. It will get you arrested. It's just how I was able to make it places that got minus double digits in the winter and moderately high crime rates.,kaosmoker,3,1,12,1488

j3ax5au,"heya. i'm sorry you're going through this shit rn.  For the address: In my experience_ some shelters will offer to take your mail so you can go pick it up there. When i was homeless and looking for jobs_ I used either the shelter's address on my resume or an old address if i was worried they'd look up the address and see that it was a shelter. i've never had any prospective employer mail me anything but_ well. if i were you_ i would call around to some places in your area to see if they offer the mail thing if that's what you need it for.  As for the safe place to sleep: that's really dependent on your area and i'm hesitant to tell you exactly where to go. i would start out by calling shelters right when they open and asking if they have spaces. you could knock out seeing if they do mail_ too. there is [211.org](https://211.org) for seeing what's around you. i always got really frustrated trying to navigate the front page for some reason_ so you might be better off just googling ""211 homeless resources"". it's true that not all shelters are created alike_ but it could be worth a shot_ at least just to see what's around you and what you've got to work with.  During the day i hung out in either the library at the community college or in panera with their ultimate sip club thing. gave me space to think_ which was what i really needed.  some of these places will also help you get hooked up with things like a social security card_ medicaid_ food stamps_ etc if you need any of that. i guess i'm mostly just passing the advice i was given to you...

j3bp63i,"I've had a couple of surgeries while homeless_ and while it definitely isn't fun_ there are options out there for you.  Like other folks have said_ you're gonna wanna ask the hospital you'd be having surgery at to talk with a social worker or patient advocate_ in order to formulate a discharge plan that will ensure you're going to be able to take care of yourself afterwards_ and get to any follow-up appointments.   I will say this though - when I see people sat that they've been told they need back surgery_ I always suggest that they get a second opinion_ and avoid any surgical centers that are run by your doctor for procedures like this_ or places like the incredibly shady spinal surgery centers that used to have commercials all over advertising their ""free"" MRI reviews. The vast majority of the procedures pushed by places like that? Are completely unnecessary_ with incredibly low rates of success_ and if you'd like some brand new nightmare fuel to keep you up at night? Check out failed back surgery syndrome.   I'd also be making real sure that everything will actually be covered. Just because you have Medicaid? Doesn't mean it will be_ and you're gonna want to confirm that with that actual billing department of where you'd be having this procedure. Anyone else? Isn't qualified to tell you what is and what is not covered_ nor whether you'd have co-pays_ or other limitations on care.  ***I'll add that any reputable doctor who was trying to schedule a much-needed back surgery for a homeless patient would be working with you to help make sure you have a discharge plan afterwards that includes a place to recover and the ability to get back and forth to follow-up appointments. If they don't make an effort to try and help you out with that? Then they're not really concerned with your health and well-being_ so much as they are with scheduling a procedure they can profit off of_ and therefore not the doctor for you.",Complaint-Expensive,2,1,3,1530

j346ckc,I'm an introvert who has learned to act like an extrovert sometimes but panhandling I was just never able to bring myself to do it. It just felt so wrong for me. So I just found other ways to make a little money while homeless.  I would offer to help clean up at pizza shops for pizza slices or make earrings to sell off a blanket. A couple of times I made some art prints and sold those in the parks because it's allowed here sans permit_ unlike jewelry which sold in the wrong place could get me busted.  I also flipped a few things I found thrifting online once I was in a shelter and had an address. I even tried to do one of those tee platform stores_ Red Bubble. I made a few bucks that way but never that much. By and large though I found if I was offering something tangible some people would buy it and help me out and I could avoid panhandling entirely.  I came out of a background in retail management and sales. So selling to me came a lot easier than just asking people for money. I actually don't like direct sales very much even if I am good at it and I'm a crafty type so I mostly just made stuff and put it out there and dickered if need be.  Just sitting on a tourist pier or on a blanket in a major park making crafty things usually had people coming over to see what I was doing out of sheer curiosity. Most days I'd sell enough for quick dinner at least.  If people offered me money I took it and thanked them but I never actually went over to them and solicited it. It was just too uncomfortable for me.,mtempissmith,6,1,9,1231

I would recommend not taking tattered-clothes or stuff you dont wear (for whatever reason) that stuff takes up space and mental bandwidth.  Be practical but also don’t ignore sentimental items.

j2ylux6,Where do you live? Are you anywhere near a national park? If so_ buy a cheap tent and find a good place to post up. The law is technically like 15 days is the limit_ but A.) Rangers don't usually bother reinforcing it_ and B.) If they do_ the law says you can literally move your tent to a new spot and the 15 days starts over. But you won't have to. Just bring books or go use public wifi to download shows_ because it will get boring. Get a portable charger for your phone_ they're not that expensive. I bought a recurve bow and some arrows from a sporting goods store_ and that kept me entertained for a while. There are some areas in national parks where camping isn't allowed_ but they're limited. Just look up the back country camping/no back country camping sign and look for it. You can also just look up BLM (bureau of land management) land near you_ as not all of them are national parks.   A lot of truck stops have showers_ and the most I've ever paid for one was 15 bucks for like an hour. They usually provide soap_ shampoo_ and towels. If you don't have a job_ get one as close to your campsite as possible so you don't spend too much on gas. I used to drive 45 miles one way from my campsite to work_ and it was expensive. But_ you won't be paying for rent or utilities_ so your money will stack until you're comfortable getting a place.   If that route isn't an option for you_ you'll want to look for 24 hour stores_ neighborhoods where street parking is allowed (it'll be obvious)_ churches_ and truck stops. Rest stops tend to have a two hour or so limit. Walmart either does or doesn't allow overnight parking_ depending on the store. They almost always have signs up in the parking lot letting you know if it's not allowed_ but if you aren't sure_ just go in_ say you're traveling_ and ask if you're allowed to park over night. No harm in asking. Also_ if you're parked somewhere you're not supposed to be_ the worst that will happen is you'll get woken up by a cop tapping on your window_ telling you to move. Don't go to the same place over and over again. If this is what you have to do_ then use your days off to go out to a national park and camp there_ if only to get a break from the city.   And finally_ I just wanna say that I lived this way for about 8 months_ split between two areas. I've also lived this way with a girlfriend who was down for it. Those were_ by far_ the happiest months of my life. I didn't rely on anyone_ the only bills I had to worry about were my phone bill and gas for my car. I got to camp in some truly beautiful places_ and bathe in beautiful (albeit very cold) rivers. It's gotten me out of some living situations that were making me miserable. I felt free_ and I kinda wish I could do it now.  Anyway_ good luck OP.,NeverNude-Ned,3,1,3,1530
j2zexe5,I may not have any advice directly for your situation but given that you are very young_ there is something to consider.   While you are working_ gain a skill or if you already have skills_ work on improving those skills significantly.    The reason why I say this is because rent and inflation has been through the roof over the past two now going on three years.   That way when you get a place of your own_ you would have skills or even certificates that will land you higher paying jobs_ that will better support you.   Never put all of your eggs into one basket because the way things have been going_ it should teach us that having more skills and specializations will significantly benefit you in the long-run. That way you will always have a leverage and never become a victim of the stratified systems that currently work against us.

So you can extend this buffer period if you need to by telling them that you are working on getting rent from family_ Etc.   An eviction on your record makes it difficult to rent in the future.

My credit is jacked, I was homeless and if I would have had a quick and easy way, like a gun while I was going through it I would not be here right now.    you may have tried or thought  of some of these already but some suggestions:    Is there anyone friend, family or someone that you could stay with that you could offer to give some money too each week?  Until you can figure some things out.    You could try maybe looking for a room to rent, if you're comfortable with that rather then an apartment. There might not be so much emphasis on the credit.    Contact local homeless services, your local DHS etc... see what assistance they offer. Even if you don't think you'll be eligible still try. At the very least they may be able to get you into a shelter if they're openings.    I know how tough it is to be in this situation and how hopeless it feels. I'm really sorry you're going through this.

I think changing your perspective, your mind on certain things are key…once while visiting a Coffee shop, I over heard an older man say to a woman accompanying him, “you need to change your thinking on that.”  Initially, I was taken aback thinking it being rude, but it actually wasn’t.  That has stuck with me since and I sometimes bring it into question, especially when I’m frustrated due to not getting anywhere on a particular issue.  I had to decide to give up on something today, but in doing so, I’ll benefit later by not further dreading the decision and optimizing what funds will be saved  now in making the decision early.  OP, try to look at things in a light that helps to balance things out for you.
102nom2,j2vhyr5,,Can you stay in an AirBnB? In my area room in an AirBnB is only a little more than a regular room for rent.  Killing yourself when you have a job and cash is many things not good, but, most, relevant, is short-sighted. You are necessary to the world. Use thr cash in thr bank to find a motel room or roomshare for the next 3-7 days. Then it will be easier to problem solve the housing situation.
102nom2,j2xbss5,,Lots of good suggestions here, but I’d also recommend taking a look at transitional housing programs. For homeless people in specific job fields they sometimes have private dorm rooms for you to stay in for several months. Gives you a chance to improve your credit while having a roof over your head. I’d say to call 211 in the city or township you’re in and inquire to speak to a social worker. Good luck! You got this. I believe in you.
102nom2,j2xdj2a,,You got to rent a room. If you find some people who are renting an apartment and who will rent you a room ask them if you can have a utility bill in your name and pay it on time every month to improve your credit. I also do this for housemates in a house I own if they want (I give them the money to pay the bills and they get the credit bump).  You can of course also use credit cards and any other form borrowing that you pay off without incurring debt to improve your credit so that one day you'll be able to rent an apartment if that's what you choose to do.

102l4e1,,j2u3hse,I agree with this. It is correct.  You must learn to rely on yourself, and only have faith in yourself. Trying to rely on others to survive will always leave you in the lurch, and under their thumb.   You must strive to find yourself a better job. Being able to pay for a room gives you more power and freedom. But it will never just be handed to you. You must work to make it happen.  If you continue to place your trust and believe in other people, you will learn the hard way that it is better to be alone than to be betrayed.

102jm3a,j2tte0q,,RVs aren't amazing on gas but would make living at campgrounds much more comfortable and house like, you can buy state park passes and stuff and that would basically be your only rent as long as the pass lasts, letting you camp pretty much anywhere for certain amounts of time. You can save alot of money that way, you just have to hop around whatever campsites are around forever which could get draining I'd imagine, but I rolled with some people doing that and you can literally run it all flying a sign for a few hours a day, so if you had a job you could stack cash pretty quick and maybe be able to just buy land or a house in the future. I'm planning on doing that myself and know some that are much farther along than me, I live in a minivan rn.  The bonus is also you can just travel literally anywhere and there's your house right along with you, state park pass, boom now you live there. Sleep at walmart for work in town, dissappear into the forest on the weekends. Figure out where has the lowest cost of living with the nicest environment and just go there, and work until you got a decent living situation like land or a house or something. The possibilities really open up when you get something like that cause you can shower and eat actual home cooked meals and shit in your own toilet, *stand up and walk*, lay down flat in a your own proper bed, watch tv, if you have a dog or cat it'll be extatic to just be in a house, so you end up feeling alot better about everything. I sure did when I lived in one briefly on a few separate occasions, they weren't mine tho.
102jm3a,,j2wlzkk,Are RVs expensive to maintain? I always wondered how someone would fix a mechanical issue if they are out in the middle of Utah with a giant RV they can’t move.
102jm3a,,j2wobih,A maintenence regimen is a good practice, frequently checking everything and getting the problem before its a real issue helps a bit. Parts for RVs can be pretty expensive depending on what you have, some rvs are built on popular vehicles, like the Ford and Chevrolet ones are just built on E-350 vans, so parts would be a little easier to come by. You gotta be selective with buying rvs, but if you get the right one from the right dude it'll last you quite awhile. Like try to find an old man who used it once or twice in the 90s and wants it out of his yard now or something, there's a few of those kinds of people around usually and they offer a shocking price for what it is sometimes. My homies almost got a legit, 100%, airstream from the 70s in near perfect condition, for less than 10 grand, those go for literally hundreds of thousands. My homies got fucked in the end cause he played takebacksies and gave it to his daughter, which kinda sucked.   Buying a truck and pulling a trailer is also a solution, or buying a truck and a camper that sits in the bed, the truck bed camper can be cramped at times but then you'd just have to worry about the truck going wrong and not just the whole house

102jm3a,j2u8lyw,,Consider coolworks.com. There are a lot of jobs that provide housing and food.
102jm3a,,j2ugwpi,I'll check it out, thank you!
102jm3a,j2vuble,,It's very possible. I've done it many times over the last 15 years. I travel around nomadically every three months or so. I aged out of foster care and had no roots or anyone to turn to so I just started moving around. I figured out if you camp someplace far away from anyone else so you can get good rest so can hold a job. Go to a temp agency and tell them you'll take anything that ways well. It's never failed me in any city. I work for three months and spend the bare minimum strictly on food. It's kinda miserable but after three months of saving alone, I've gotten myself off the street many times and into a nice apartment.    Recently I was lucky enough to find two people who wanted a house so I asked if they wanted to split it three ways and get a house and just work as a team. It's been a year and a few months and it's working out great. We all make our own money and work as a village. We went in on a 2 bedroom house to rent. It's way cheaper and more spacious than an apartment.    We split all the bills, and share one vehicle carpooling to work different days. We share problems while being considerate to not make unnecessary problems. I cook most of the meals and grocery shop for the house from a list we make. We sit down and have a weekly dnd game at our 6-foot dining table, it's a fold-up plastic table but hell it's a clean table and I'm happy about having it.   My point is you can make it. Don't give up. Have a goal in mind and be flexible because it might change for the better. I was planning to be an island beach bum by now. I was gonna hitch a ride on a boat to Puerto Rico and figure it out from there. Fishing and relaxing in a Hammock.   The biggest thing to remember is this is part of your journey.  It may suck but the worse it seems now the more you'll be able to laugh at how crazy things were when you look back.   For example, I've had my hand shoved in a lawn mower, half my face burned off, lost my legs for a year after getting stuck under a semi (physical therapy is truly magic I'm telling you, i swear some of them are sadists tho), I've been stabbed 5 times, my head split open, and shoes melted so bad I had to cut them off my feet, fought off five junkies with a 15-inch kukri on the outskirts of a town by campfire light and lived to talk about it, hit by a truck on a gravel road and launched 15 feet into a ditch and woke up sometime later all gimpy. *AND I still don't qualify for disability.* lmfao   I'm hard-headed and used to be pretty reckless but some of us take a rough path while others can learn from their mistakes early on. I hope you learn faster than me.   Life can throw a lot at you but you can make it. Everyone has their shit they have to experience some more some less. Just know that if you want things to change they can just plan and stay flexible. Find that razor-edged balance between reckless and overly cautious. You have to take calculated risks to make changes.   No matter what happens every day find a little thing to make you smile. So long as you can take pleasure in the little things everything will work out in the end. Besides, it's about the journey and the memories you make on the way to your goal.
102jm3a,j2tw05e,,I would suggest getting an rv that would be your cheapest option.Its like having your own home on wheels 😜.
102jm3a,j2ujeve,,It's extremely difficult and I'd say damn near impossible for some people.  It all depends on the situation.  I know that if my mom didn't have a HCV then we would be completely fucked with no chance of ever affording a place.  When I was working full time in medical field I didn't even make enough to live on my own. I lived with my cousin/her bf  and we all split things 3 ways.  At one point me and cousin who both had full time jobs me in a doctor's office and her in medical billing were looking for a place for us and her daughter who was a baby at the time so we would have needed  a two bedroom.  We couldn't find anything that we could afford even searching in the worst places and that was about 5-6 years ago.     Things today are the worst I've ever seen. I barely made it out of homelessness my mom's HCV was going to expire Oct. 3rd. I found an apartment at the end of August. After 8 months of searching and 3 months of being homeless which lasted another month before we could move.  The price of rent is absolutely insane plus the extreme and ridiculous requirements like making 3x the amount of rent and near perfect credit scores.  The waiting lists for section 8 where I live is about 10 years. I really don't know how other low/no income people survive, it's usually by living with family members. For those who can afford rent, it's what most of their paycheck goes towards. That's why there are so many people with full time jobs who are still homeless.   For those that are homeless due to addiction/severe mental illness the support needed to help them needs to be comprehensive involving medical/psych treatment, financial assistance, living assistance depending on their condition.  Which just isn't there for them. Especially since most assistance denies anyone who has a drug addiction or criminal record. It's really bad out here for a lot of people and it's so easy for those who don't have to deal with it to just brush it off and separate themselves from it because it doesn't effect them or because they see the homeless as different then themselves.
102jm3a,,j2yldvl,It’s also that what might be needed to help homeless addicts, mentally ill,   and/or those with a criminal record is so overwhelming and astronomically expensive that many people just give up even worrying about it. It seems impossible, and may be impossible. I’m a former heroin addict and I met my husband at a long term residential rehab where the worst cases often get sent. We are of the very, very few that made it out. Even after two years of treatment, the majority ran right back out to get high and so many of the people we knew are dead that I’ve lost count. No one can afford to financially support an active addict and if they don’t put the work in to get themselves together then there’s nothing you can do. It really does seem hopeless and insurmountable.
102jm3a,j2xtjjf,,You guys both need to work as much as possible and get as much money saved as you can. Keep bills to a minimum. Ditch expensive habits smoking and 420 will also impact any housing search. ...you might rehome the pet since you are homeless and you have a better chance of finding housing pet free. There are also fosters and non profits that might temp take in the pet.   Check craigslist or FB marketplace and see if anyone maybe has a casita..again the pet maybe a problem...hotels are way too expensive and are not sustainable so avou the hotel route they will just take your money
102jm3a,j2tknnd,,Keep working hard and you'll find your way back.  A van can be good because no rent but also can have its own problems because of parking, zoning, limited space and amenities, etc.  Rent is a treadmill that many never graduate from to home ownership.  The only way to get ahead in a capitalist society is to find ways to make your money work for you. When you do this, they're called assets and they tend to be protected from inflation, unlike wages.
102jm3a,,j2tt8sk,Thanks for the encouragement. I really appreciate it. It's hard being positive all the time.
102jm3a,,j2u64ub,I've been homeless. I had a lot of help getting back on my feet. I have reached out to others with mixed success. I wish you both the very best! If you were in Colorado I could provide more resources but I'm just one guy on Reddit.
102jm3a,,j2uh9n0,Thank you, I appreciate well wishes all the same.

102jm3a,,j2ugv6v,That's a good idea, thank you.
102jm3a,,j2vfdjy,You can find seasonal jobs on coolworks.com and they usually provide housing and often meals.
102jm3a,j2uz6sa,,Check out the website affordablehousing.com. Apply for all the affordable housing you can. If you need help with the fees, move-in, & deposits, ask around to churches. Decide your own goals. If living room in an RV is really what you want, then do that. Living with other people is very difficult. I would rather be camping. I would speak with a financial counselor or social worker. Maybe someone can give you some suggestions. Some of the churches will help you with this. You can also apply at job training that provides housing. TeenChallenge and Delancey Street both offer job training and free housing.  There can be a lot of pressure to conform. You don’t need to be like everybody else. I don’t know if you or your fiancé have done any time in jail (I hope not), but there are some “reentry” programs that offer housing and job training.  I would also go to the unemployment office and ask them. Sometimes they have classes on how to do a job search. You can take a personality test to find out what kind of work you might like. There is an excellent book “What Color is Your Parachute”.  And the local library can be a resource. Librarians can help you with a bizillion things.  Check with your parks & rec department for free classes. There is a big demand for people to be electricians, stone masons, and other construction jobs. They will also offer training.  Let us know how you are doing. You won’t be homeless forever.

102jm3a,j2vg6y4,,A car or van can be very helpful by giving you some shelter, privacy, safety and the ability to move around. It comes with other problems but it’s often a good goal if you can afford it. Check out sites like cheaprvliving.com that show how to do it. Stay away from most of the vanlife videos where people spend thousands building the perfect setup and end up moving back in with their parents. If you look a little, there are plenty of people living in cars and vans and doing great.
102jm3a,j2whqaf,,As I write from time to time, homelessness is a complete breakdown of basic humanity, the entire system from your mother to the United Nations having failed you, and you failing the system. The older one gets the less likely to rebuild humanity, plain and simple. Not to mention the ongoing massacre of the middle class, which means that even if you rebuild some of the soft tissue of your life and somehow learn to live with your uncle or your friend or whatever, it will be a life of minimal space and poverty. Anyway, enough with the good news :)   Unless a miracle happens, most people that will come out of homelessness will do so with subsidised housing, with all the waiting, heartbreak and uncertainty that will bring. But I wanted to mention the elephant in the room, home ownership. For me and others who don't have severe mental or physical problems, our housing fate had something to do with little interest or investment in home ownership. Yeah, I know I sound like a madman, people don't have $1000 for the rent and I'm talking about hundreds of thousands, but it's home ownership that keeps billions from homelessness, and it is the closest to subsidised housing one can get just by saving money with a life partner and focusing on affordability and sustainability.  Sure, affordability is an issue in general terms, but not so much if you're going to fight for your modest home and mortgage tooth and nail.  I won't lie, once you've spent a month or two without paying rent the idea of tightening a $200K noose around your neck is very unappealing, but it's also part of rebuilding our humanity, having a couch or a garage for the next fellow human being in need, renting out a room when help with the mortgage is needed. Get hitched, get a mortgage, live grumpy ever after!
102jm3a,,j2yk4f3,It is true, if you can just save up the minimal amount needed for an FHA mortgage or first time home buyer program or something then homeownership is the best way to go.  I know that’s easier said then done, but for those that can, try to avoid renting.
102jm3a,j2yb6xi,,Not that long ago you could hold a job for a few years and set yourself up. Not anymore

102jm3a,,j2ts27f,Nope, I live in Georgia.
102jm3a,j2w0wn1,,You can escape homelessness with dedication, self-discipline, and a little help from social service agencies, family, friends, and good luck. If you aren't completely mentally or physically ill or lost, you have a good chance. The permanent homeless seem to be those who gave up and accepted their lifestyle, chose it, or are too damaged or incapable of doing what is necessary to get out of their situation.
102jm3a,,j30lvsy,There is also the in between. Been unofficially homeless/couch surfing for two years. Been officially homeless for 10 months. SSI takes time to develop. Section 8, there is a waiting list. Welfare might be on hold if you have to recertify, or for whatever reason etc.. If you want to do something fun, you can't. You lose energy, and your soul and spirit is broken, to attend social events. You don't have the money either, and have to be at the shelter before 7 etc. You can't donate Plasma, if you don't have a lease/residency proof, and prove you're not a desultory person, you are sometimes banned from their facilities if you use a charity address. You feel you are out of options.  Then I feel, at 31 years of age, (I'll be 32 on the 16th lol) I made it this long, aside from ocassional cigarettes, and very light liquor use, I am drug, and ill gotten criminal activity free. But it's hard for people not to be tempted I guess. No money, no help, so they turn to drugs, and negativity, and toxicity. Which is not an excuse, don't get me wrong. But still.  I feel, I get what you're saying, but it came across like we aren't trying. My welfare was shut off until March,, unless I get my disability wavers signed, which is an adventure. I was not selected for a section 8 voucher. I'm waiting to hear back from social security, as I'm autistic. I'm Black and gay, with no money, and no boyfriend. (This is Robo/Jeremiah from the Discord server BTW lol).   But I'm trying. Nobody wants to help you, and judges you.
102jm3a,,j30mmsh,I understand it can be extremely difficult and hope you can get out of this situation asap. Don't give up as hard as it can get.
102jm3a,j2w3kd3,,Took me 2 weeks.  Luxury apartments here for $800, regular ones for $650, just checked. Get out of the cities, crime isn't even an issue in the cheap parts of town.  Everywhere is hiring. Factory jobs for $21+/hr, gas station jobs for $18, fast food for $15.
102jm3a,,j2w626k,Everywhere I live has gone up. My old 1 bedroom used to be about $800 and now it's over $1,300 in a shitty area. I live out in the country now, so I don't have a lot of options when it comes to apartments/houses. They're all expensive because the demand is high. I also have to be able to afford rent + the initial deposit and pet deposits, which are expensive. I definitely can't save up that much in 2 weeks, but I'm trying.
102jm3a,,j2yahqq,It's definitely gone up here too. Used to have a 3br house in town for $450.      I'm sure it will continue to go up too, but at least wages are also going up.       I couldn't have saved it up in 2 weeks by myself either, I found a roommate.

102jm3a,j2u1wb2,,Put your pet up for adoption. I know a pet is like a family member but when we were renters only the rentals at the top of the price range would allow pets. Reality is a lot of pets cause damage to the property, not saying yours would, but it doesn’t make financial sense for the landlord for rentals with a lower profit that won’t compensate for the potential damage.
102jm3a,,j2uh86n,I already tried that when I was on the street and wanted better for them. Nobody was interested in taking my cat and all the shelters were full.

j2w6q3s,I'm so sorry you are going through all this. I went into the shelter system and finally after 4 years got on boston housing. I got to keep my cat because I rented from a private landlord and even though it said no pets after she met my kids and I she changed her mind. I also got to keep my cat at the shelter because I was in a shelter apartment. I did have to give up my other cats but one was adopted right away the other 3 went into a rescue who had no actual shelter they just used foster homes. 2 were adopted together. While at the shelter I found a 6 month old kitten who i tried to hide but he walked out right in front of my case worker. I found him a home on this site.   https://rehome.adoptapet.com/   On adopt a pet you put in pictures and a bio about the animals and people who want to meet them email you. You pick out their family. Make sure to meet in a public place and have someone with you. I got my kitten adopted in 1 day. I miss him a lot.   If you are keeping them this organization in Nevada helps homeless people and their pets all over U.S. and parts of Canada. If you go on their website you can put in your city or zip code and you can find free pet food. They also have resources on their website. They also pay for crates and vet care but for those you have to call them. From Boston I would call my time 1-3pm EST  they are open M-F 9-3pm   here is the the site     http://petsofthehomeless.org/    Good luck I wish the best for you and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask or dm me.

j2tv9h1,I don’t suggest saving up for a van because I have a feeling it’s goin to get tougher for people in cars_ vans_ and rv’s in the coming years. There’s a few reasons for this. The ruling people are trying to get people to drive much less and no longer be able to afford or own your own vehicle. They are making it hard and expensive to repair your vehicle. They will continue to increase cost of gas. U might have trouble finding parts for older cars on purpose. The only way to get out of this situation is through God. I mean it would help to find a church u can stand going to and start making connections there. The government won’t help u. You need people who are compassionate and genuinely can offer assistance. You also need to have faith that God will create opportunities that will help u get out of homelessness. U can’t let the seemingly impossible circumstances make u feel like it’s hopeless.

j2ryxzw,You can quickly and easily get into a room for rent within 3 week.   Facebook Marketplace -> Rentals -> rooms for rent  Prices range from $400 - $900 a month depending on where you live. Many places have furnished rooms included. To move in_ it usually costs first months rent and a security deposit (usually around $50-$200_ some don’t require it). You sign onto the lease and get to have a cheap room for 3-6 months guaranteed_ sometimes a year contract. There’s plenty of young women roomating_ and because you are a young woman still in school_ you’ll be priority (meaning you’ll likely be first choice for many people renting out a room in their home). Many people are very nice and don’t care about a great credit score. As long as you can pay the rent every month_ you’re good.    This option is much cheaper and quicker than trying to rent an apartment. And because your dealing with people instead of a rental company_ they’ll be understanding and willing to negotiate. Also_ utilities_ wifi_ and everything is usually included in the advertised monthly rent_ and you won’t need to worry about buying appliances_ furniture for the whole house_ and setting up wifi etc. You share the living space_ kitchen_ and bathrooms with the other house mates (You can easily find one that has all females).    I would say_ save up to get a used car (Facebook marketplace is a great option to buy a used car_ it’s where I got mine). If not_ Uber or taking the bus. Or_ if you work close enough and school is close enough_ get a bike to ride around on. Or even a scooter (like a moped)_ you don’t need a license and you’ll be able to ride on the street_ but not the highway. If you don’t want to go to school physically_ speak with one of your school counselors to see if you can do online school (to get around having to find transportation).

j2q2ggx,The last time I stayed in a shelter was in the mid90s. They had a very strict policy about revealing the names of people staying there at night. This was to protect any potential domestic violence victims. It was a co-ed shelter that was only open from dinner time to breakfast time. I can't imagine other shelters wouldn't have the same policy. Especially not a women's shelter.,SugarHooves,12,1,3,1530

j2q8lim,Shelters are not likely to give out information.  If all you have is a first name that can make it more difficult.  You could try the cops that escorted her out of the place_ but even then you chances are not that great.  You are a good person to remember her.  Who knows_ maybe she got the apartment already.,Livid-Rutabaga,2,1,3,1530
j2qqewz,"I don't know if the shelter workers would be willing to (or be honest about their unwillingness to) but you could try calling around and leaving a message for Patricia with your contact information- phone number might be easier for her to access from a shelter than email_ or maybe something like ""I'm Suzy (or whoever) from the laundromat- I have a coat for Patricia that I'm leaving at the laundromat where we met"" if you don't want to have your phone number floating around.",Rageybuttsnacks,1,1,3,1530

If someone were to buy me a healthy meal_ I'd be thrilled but I can't bring food back to the shelter. I have a lot to get done in the 9-3 [a trip to the pharmacy can take all day with public transportation]. If I were brave enough to panhandle_ I would only be able to eat one meal. Foodstamps won't pay for anything cooked_ so I eat at convenience stores and get 1/3 the food I could afford if I had a home.   Maybe gift cards for fast-food?

With everyone upgrading their phones every year or two_ it's not hard to find old models of decent phones or even flagship models handed down or thrown out_ and even if they're paying for their service and their phones_ don't people realize that the answer to ""how can he be homeless if he can afford a phone?"" is...

How should a jobless homeless person who owns a car maintain that car? Or do they just not deserve to keep the car because they don't have a job or home?  Specifically what order is a person required to give up their personal possessions for you to believe they're worthy of help or charity? Once I don't have a house am I absolutely required to sell the car too? Or is there a circumstance under which you'd allow me to keep it?

j2q76dn,"Homelessness has a lot of different looks. I only told a small number of friends about my situation and a few were shocked that I consider myself homeless because I'm crashing in my dad's guest room. I'm lucky as shit_ no doubt about it_ but I'm here illegally. Once the neighbors catch on that I'm here I'll have to spend chunks of the week in my car so I maintain guest status vs illegal tenant status. Counting my blessings_ but it's still not having the safety of *knowing* where I'll be tonight and I can't get regular custody of my son unless there's a place to stay. I think my friends don't want to think of someone they know_ someone they relate to and who is as smart and educated as them be homeless because it really makes them confront how few barriers are standing in between *them* and homelessness. So I'm just calling it couch surfing and hiding in plain sight to make everyone comfortable. But it's not like ""hashtag van life"" was my choice_ and I'm so scared and stressed and lonely. I can be thankful for my physical safety and comfort and simultaneously psychologically distressed by the constant threat of that safety being snatched away.

I suggest you not spend time like that bonding with others. I find it hard to bond with others and even if I spent years with them that would not work with me.

Most ""youth shelters"" [basically a homeless shelter exclusively for people in their teens or early 20s] have some kind of education program_ where they help you prepare for your GED.

j2k3t4a,well it depends. as someone who was also homeless through high school the answer varies on your situation. are you under the age of 18 and if so who’s supposed to be taking care of you? are you over 18 and just looking to finish your education? basically if you’re under 18 and still living with an adult you can go to school while homeless but you better not tell anyone that or come to school actually “looking” homeless or i can guarantee that an adult somehow will catch on and call CPS to get you put in custody which if you’re actually homeless and under 18 i think is a fantastic opportunity because CPS has access to grants and financial aid that can really help you achieve goals like getting your own car and house thus making you no longer homeless. but of course situations tend to be more complicated than that & also if you happen to be over 18 i would suggest getting into a GED program,XaddyXanny,2,1,3,1530

j2inc7j,"Does seem like a ""you"" problem to be honest. I think a lot of people in this world are selfish and self-absorbed_ but other people genuinely care about others and don't mind hearing their problems or their venting. I am one of those people. I've fed_ prayed for_ and given money to homeless or complete strangers. I do care about their suffering and life story. Though I think this world emphasizes selfishness and getting ahead by screwing over people_ but I think it has more exposure than seeing random acts of kindness or volunteer work with hurting people.   Just seems like you don't care or can show empathy because of your own dislike of sharing your own personal problems_ so yes_ it's self-projecting that you're doing. I wouldn't say it's bad or good_ that's just a decision you decided and are ok with. I'm not the one to judge what someone likes or dislikes.   As for me personally_ I got an awesome therapist to talk with about my own issues. No way would I just spill all the beans and tell very personal things to complete strangers. That is_ non professional people_ that studied for years and know strategies to help with my issues. I mean sometimes I can empathize or sympathize with others if they struggle with similar things I've faced_ so therefore I try to give advice or encouragement to them. Though it's not the right place to start talking about your problems_ if that makes sense.   Just like drug addicts teaching others about quitting or how they escaped that life style_ but that doesn't mean they will start telling their life story or all their problems. Just have to understand the difference_ and when it's the correct time to overshare. Meanwhile_ others are perfectly ok sharing their issues with a best friend they completely trust_ others won't even trust or talk to a therapist.  I honestly don't know why some people care or don't care_ maybe it's upbringing and never having opportunities to help others or even give a damn? Such as rich people that don't care at all about the homeless or poor people_ it has never crossed their mind nor have they been exposed to it. I guess when people suffer and go through very real and similar issues as those around them_ they grow kind and compassionate? Especially to those that are going through similar things.

In the last few years_ I’ve found it harder and harder to live among so many clearly selfish and self-indulgent people. Best to remember it’s got nothing to do with me.   I think I kind of understand where you’re coming from. I go to a clinic where it’s just a fact that every client there has had a tough ride and could list a hundred reasons to feel sorry for them. People don’t act like that_ tho. If I went there and started crying about how hard my life is_ yes_ I would assume something is wrong with me — major social faux pas.

j2odo4d,"One thing to realize about people experiencing homelessness is that all of them are traumatized.  There is a huge difference in resources/ability between people who live in a home and people who don't.   People who can plug in an alarm clock (for their cell phone)_ for instance_ have an instant advantage in being able to show up for a work interview. Such an accommodation is a prestigious amenity for those who experience homelessness_ and is far from common.  Next is the quality of sleep that you get when you are able to lock the entrance door of your home. People experiencing homelessness do not sleep like that. The experience of homelessness means that you are in fight or flight mode 24 hours a day.  The neurophysiologists would point out that this means adrenaline and cortisol all the time. They would point out that your body and your mind are not able to heal from trauma at the same rate as those who have a sound place to sleep in a home_ because the states of body equilibrium required for homeostasis (the process that heals you) is not possible without a home.  Since there is no healing on the street_ there is no comparison to make between people who are housed and people who are not. The ability and resources available to these two groups with regards to finding_ acquiring_ and maintaining a job is so far from equal that it is preposterous to assume that people experiencing homelessness ""don't want to work"".  That said_ many do work. They sleep in their cars_ or other accommodations_ and are able to maintain their jobs through a Herculean effort. They should have the respect of everyone.  Those that do not have a job often have to use tactics to survive that are frowned upon in the housed community. Sometimes it involves black markets_ sex work_ and theft. A constant element in all of those tactics is violence_ and the threat of violence is ever present.  Nevertheless_ when you speak to people who have experienced homelessness you will find that trauma is not the only thing left.   The part of them that wants peace_ that wants to heal_ that wants a home_ is still there. The desire to belong to a community_ and have authentic relationships is still there.   Even people who appear to be ""living weapons"" still have the ability to be part of a good community_ when given enough chances. But it is not easy.  I like the giving nature of Housing First_ but I think there should be more training for people entering a subsidized apartment. Life training_ survival skills that pertain to housing_ and discussions of healthy boundaries with others should be part of the housing first process_ but they are not.   What people need to understand most about those who experience homelessness is that theft and criminal activity does not erase an individuals humanity_ and their need for belonging.

j2g0qub,Hey_  I’m sorry you are having issues with your mother. I know how that feels and my mother has her own issues to the point where I do not want to hold a conversation with her anymore.  I’ve lived in campgrounds and at rest stops in my car. While living at these places I can suggest to you what you may need. First and foremost is to pray to God. Reflect on how you got yourself in the situation in the first place. Ask for forgiveness in anything you may have done wrong. You will begin to see your life open up more with some optimism.  For supplies it’s really crucial that you utilize food pantries and to make sure you have plenty of clothing at least for 7 days. Socks get lost easy so please account for that. It’s good you have a gym membership. The workouts alone can make you feel somewhat normal again and the rewarding showers take advantage of.  All in all you are not alone. This is a really good time to reflect on yourself as a person and set measurable obtainable goals to get out of your situation. Maybe it’s further education or the military or whatever. Point being is that in order to not dive your mind into the bad stuff you gotta redirect focus onto the good. Get proactive in something that is going to build you up.   This is the rock bottom for sure but just know that everything in life is temporary and not the end for you. The biggest advice I could prob give is practicing self care and taking care of yourself physically and mentally. It can get lonely at times so if you ever need a listening ear please feel free to DM.  Happy Holidays to you and I’m look forwarding to seeing your progression!   Godspeed. 🙏🏽,Long-Translator1602,6,1,8,1024

This also addresses the problem of basic human rights_ which include dignity_ the right to a safe living space_ the right to have a livelihood & autonomy over their own lives & bodies. The term ""houseless"" whittles the entire situation down to not having a house_ regardless of whether or not you have a shelter. The reliance in this society_ on owning land for even the most basic amount of human dignity_ is terrifying. It is only a version of serfdom_ with shinier toys & more steps to climb up in station_ equalling respect. So_ no_ changing the word does not affect me in the least. If it inherently changed how I'm treated or how the entire situation is handled_ I'd be all for it.",devientlight,2,1,3,1530

The obnoxious people disappear eventually.  If you need a break from the lot_ there are good places to stealth camp. Lots of weekly shower locations and trailers and free laundry. Plenty of grocery stores and public restrooms. 24 hour gyms are nearby.  There's a day center there with free meals_ free coffee and wifi that reaches the parking lot.

j2e9ds0,This is why I found a secluded spot on the edge of town and make a campsite so I don't have to worry too much about where to go. I can wake up_ start a small fire make myself some coffee_ wash up with a wet rag or baby wipes and head to a temp agency for day to day labor to get some money in my pocket. Holidays I'd just putter around my campsite breaking down wood for fire needs_ making my camp more comfortable_ I'd fish (string stick and a hook) as I usually set up on a water edge_ when I wanna just relax I would watch movies I downloaded onto my phone last time I was near good wifi.   Sometimes I'd dumpster dive at grocery store for things that were still good but expired to cook up and share with other people in similar situations as myself. We'd go to a park and use the grill to cook up steaks frequently as it was common the expensive steaks at this one store never got purchased and would be tossed out package and all. Perfect condition just dated so it couldn't be sold. So on cooler days they would still be good by the time we could sneak back there and digg for them.   I've made many homeless banquets on a wood fired park grill and a couple sticks to flip and serve.   Some resources are less obvious and less desirable but you can really live well if you're willing to go the lengths. Or maybe I'm just glorifying making the best of a shitty situation.  Living close to resources can be convenient but it can take it toll. Less ability to make or find shelter_ more people meaning more danger_ not knowing where you'll sleep the next night. It's more miserable than necessary.,kaosmoker,13,1,12,1488

j2dyho7,I wrote and published a poem called Right to Die. I definitely believe in it_ and plan to go out on my own terms. I find it annoying that some doctors may require proof of “terminal illness” but I suppose I understand why. When people’s basic needs such as shelter_ safety and food needs are not met than of course more likeliness to suffer from mental illness/ depression but in my case I feel like I’ve been dehumanized and lack a sense of belonging. My family has always been dysfunctional_ and my friends are mostly fair weather friends. I also was born premature and things that come easy to most people do not come easy to me. It’s been too hard for me to keep up with the rat race and other than some traveling I want to do_ life is generally pretty lonely and unfulfilling for me. I look forward to eternal sleep and leaving the stress of survival behind. There’s these sacro pods in Switzerland that make it painless_ and ideally that’s how I’d like to go out but I live in the USA so I’ll take what I can get. 😏,bat2ghost,11,2,3,1530

j2md8ko,Despite having depression_ or CPTSD/PTSD_ if a person can hold fair reason and judgment over themselves and the view of life_ then they should be able to make choices on their own. A person suffering sever depression doesn't think like those without_ they have what some considered a warped view of life and death. I think despite serve depression or any other mental illness akin to this_ we should not offer suicide so quickly. We should strive to help people live their lives to the fullest despite their disadvantages and not doing so casts a clear lack of unimportance on human life. We shouldn't take it off the table_ because then we suggest that a person doesn't have a right to life or death despite their shortcomings_ but we also should discourage it. People live with depression for years_ decades_ it never really goes away in most cases_ and yet people can try and many have strive for a fulfilled life_ they can rely on others not to give them any easy way out_ but to know it's there_ and lift them up from that.   The biggest difference is the different way of thinking about this type of suicide: easy/hard way or a safe/dangerous way out. Many_ many people who want to die don't really want to die_ they want the pain to stop and see killing themselves as the only way out. Those who want to clock out see death as a kind of endless sleep_ the next step_ not a solution but a choice.  Those who see it as an escape should have massive support and help_ and once they can rationalize death as something that doesn't take the pain away_ they should be considered a person who isn't at risk of regretting.,ElevenOneTwo,1,3,8,1024
j2egvkk,I'd do it if it were available. If I ended myself on my own_ they'd no doubt blame my diagnosis like they did my friend_ funny how a diagnosis is enough to justify a suicide_ so people can shrug it off saying well couldn't be helped. But it could. Because they never use a diagnosis to justify helping people so they don't kill themselves,nip_pickles,3,1,3,1530
j2gaay2,I believe it will be used in the near future as a budget-saving measure by killing people off that are too costly to care for.  The reason for this_ is because like everything else in our societies_ the way it will be regulated and developed_ it will be decided by the top. Not by the majority.  Just like how the best advanced treatments for cancer and other diseases are reserved for the rich.  I believe the masses will be steered into it_ just like the majority of humans have been steered into barren childless lifestyles for the past 30 years.  The middle and working class elderly will be left with fewer and fewer resources_ savings_ and quality of life_ until they will eventually be pressured or encouraged to take their own lives_ because it will be the only affordable option.  Euthanasia will become the standard. Living into older age will be reserved for the rich and others few elites deemed deserving.,tuggyforme,3,1,3,1530

j2dsnkp,I agree and I see why it would have benefits. I’m not against it being legalised but I find it worrying. When I said some people can’t decide I was meant cases like psychosis which does impact your judgement and can be temporary. There are so many opportunities for it to cause harm or be abused_ there are so many difficult questions and I don’t know if it’s up to other individuals to decide_ like should there be an age limit? It’s like how the death penalty is bad because innocent people might be tried guilty. If you accidentally kill someone who you shouldn’t have_ you can’t undo it. That risk makes me worry because the desire to end one’s life due to mental illness is much more common than untreatable cases of mental illness. Anyway I’m not against it and I definitely see how it might help some people,daypanay,2,2,3,1530
j2fl6yh,No. The sufferer has a right to end their own life. Euthanasia is a govt program based on Eugenics designed to remove undesirables from their populations. Govts have no right to say who may/not die_ when_ and how. Except for maps and rapists.,Clobhairchaun,1,4,3,1530
j2dfvbz,Why do you need the government to euthanize you? It's easy enough to do it on your own if you really want to. And aren't mentally ill people not in their right minds anyway? So how can they make a sound decision legally or does their doctor decide for them?,smoked0g,-3,1,3,1530
j2di3ho,I'm involved in another forum where this is brought up. Basically do it yourself methods are scary and violent and not guaranteed to succeed potentially leaving you in a worse position. For instance we have people that have lived through shooting themselves in the head and now are still alive but with brain damage. We have people who jump off Bridges which is a terrifying act and they still survive. I have a friend who's rehearsed committing suicide and wanted to do it many times but just can't bring himself to do it. He's fantasized about having a big jar of pills where most of them are benign but one of them is the pill so every day he takes a pill and goes about his life and one day his troubles will be over.    So the debate isn't about legalizing suicide because it's already available the debate is about making it so that our society and medical profession is allowed to help you do it without so much fear and uncertainty and pain.  As to your question about mental illness_ most mental illnesses do not render you incapable of making such choices. Sure some people are so far gone they don't even have a sense of where they are or have ability to make decisions and also people with things like mania aren't necessarily in the right mind to make a decision. But for things like depression schizophrenia when managed bipolar when they're not in the middle of a manic episode dissociative identity disorder and a whole host of others the person is by and large here with us and aware of their condition and aware of how much pain they are in.  For those that are so mentally gone that they cannot make and informed decision_ as far as I know we are not discussing coerced euthanasia yet which generally would be understood to be murder.,PurpleDancer,7,3,3,1530
j2erucr,For most mental illness I'm not an advocate. Mental illness can be treated. It's not like having terminal cancer or some kind of disease where you waste away to the point where you're locked inside your own body and can't move.   I have issues with chronic depression_ C-PTSD and anxiety. I was abused by my alcoholic  parents and bullied to the point of misery as a kid by other kids. Suicide has always been a constant thought in the back of my brain since I was like 5. I was homeless for 5 years plus which did not help at all with that.   While I was homeless I thought about it all the time. I felt subhuman and I was in so much pain physically and mentally I honestly wanted to just close my eyes and die. I was technically in therapy at the time but the therapists I had did nothing to help.   Flash foward and I'm housed and doing much better. I have gone whole weeks without dark thoughts. Being housed and stable_ having an income that pays my major bills that helped me a lot. So did not having to take care of or answer to anyone for the first time in my life. I finally terminated any relationship with my toxic bunch of half siblings too.  Not allowing anyone in my life who is toxic and who might disrupt me mentally or who might bully me. Finally learning to say NO to people who just want to use me or abuse me for whatever reason that's been a majorly positive thing for me. First time ever that I put me first and you know what? I'm truly content with that and genuinely happy for the first time in my whole life.   It's still not easy sometimes. I have a couple of autoimmune diseases and major back issues. I have bad chronic pain issues and arthritis to the point where I am just in agony some days. I still get cranky and think dark thoughts when I'm really hurting but thoughts of suicide are few and far between these days because I like my life and who I am now.   I've been through hell and back several times this past decade. I lost almost everything and I had to basically claw my way back to sanity and stability. I'm proud of myself that I did that. I'm still working on getting a life and dealing with major pain and illness but it's BETTER and when the dark thoughts intrude I can put them on the backburner and not dwell on them constantly.   If I had a terminal wasting disease or was going to die horribly from some major cancer then I most certainly would head to someplace like Canada where I could terminate my life when I was ready. I'm not a masochist and I'm not traditionally religious.   I don't believe in suffering for the sake of it. I have my limits in terms of how much physical pain I am willing to endure. I don't particularly relish the thought of a truly painful death. But killing myself for mental reasons? Nah. That I can deal with_ live with.   I'd have to be very ill physically to consider it. I do believe in death with dignity and that it's my right to decide for myself what to do in extreme circumstances. I will never judge anyone else for their choice even if I don't agree with it. But for me mental illness just isn't a reason for euthanasia.,mtempissmith,1,1,9,1231
j2ftpza,Everyone should have the right_ if they are of sound mind and not under duress_ to end their life if they freely choose to do so. It's their life_ and they should be able to do as they wish with it. However_ being trapped in poverty and isolated from social support by the society around you is clearly a form of duress. These are not decisions being made freely by Free people — these are people acting under duress to escape the torment being placed on them by ending their lives. It's an absolutely disgusting situation.  And I was go as far as to call it murder. It is murder through physical_ mental_ social_ and financial abuse to the point that a person's survival mechanisms completely fail. It is no different than psychologically abusing someone until they commit suicide — except that you're throwing in an entire system of societal abuse along with it. If we lived in a just society_ then those implementing and performing this euthanasia_ as well as those who have driven these people to make that choice_ would be held accountable for murder with all that entails. The fact that we have reached such a disgusting point is proof that our society is inherently unjust_ and its existence is no longer justifiable. These are gross human rights violations_ and we must find a way to hold those responsible for accountable_ otherwise it's only going to get worse.,thelink225,1,1,3,1530

How do you establish that someone with a severe enough mental illness to request this_ is in a stable state of mind to choose death? That does not compute.  For most mental health issues_ a LOT can be resolved through proper support_ including lifestyle changes_ therapy_ and medication. It is extremely rare to have a truly medication resistant condition.  Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem_ as they say. I think it should only be self-administered_ if at all... to allow the person complete freedom to back out at any moment. I don't think any government or healthcare official should be given this power. It goes completely against the most important tenant of medicine_ the Hippocratic Oath_ ""First_ do no harm.""  The mentally ill population is so underserved. This can't possibly be the best solution that a government could come up with. The current state of access to a proper diagnosis_ therapy_ medication_ support groups_ emergency services... is abysmal.

j2pi1pv,Yes. I think some might have been misdiagnosed. Others might be romantically challenged. In the Netherlands people on disability who received services from an escort reported being much less depressed. People also mainly use suicide as a way to get attention. Most survivors instantly regret their decisions. Maybe if I was exposed to 20 grays of radiation I might not want to suffer through that. But people who have treatable conditions or just need to get laid shouldn't be getting a pass for suicide. Doctors aren't perfect and our system can give someone the run around for years with a misdiagnosis. A lot of people have been given only months to live and survived another few decades.

j28zy2p,Go for the apartment_ a place with sturdy walls and lock on the door will be better than living on the street or out of a tent_ even if it is in a bad part of town. Get a weapon of some kind- pepper spray_ a taster_ a gun if that's legal where you are to protect yourself.  Go to food banks_ they are there to help. Go to other charities or shelters that can offer food_ maybe even a route to work that will pay better will show up there. I would get a bike_ though that's more money. However_ once you get it_ it costs very little in maintenance compared to a car. Look on places like facebook marketplace_ or other sites that sell stuff like that. Usually you can get them for much cheaper then retail price and if you're really lucky_ for free.  Don't waste money on the hotel_ or stay there as little as you can. That's money you're using instead of putting it towards the rent for the apartment.  If you have free time_ volunteer at the food banks. You'll make friends_ build a security net around you and you'll be helping people all the while.,ElevenOneTwo,35,1,8,1024
j2a3vn2,I am sorry to hear that. You cannot let your mom bring you down or have you end up homeless again. If she is not going to treat her mental illness or help manage it there is not much you can do. She can figure out her own housing.  Craigslist and [roomies.com](https://roomies.com) have alot of ads for roommates or call an apt locator service. If you get the sketchy apt sign a short lease if you want and secure all the doors and windows.,Desperate-Long359,4,2,3,1530

j2a8upt,Sounds like you and I are battling with the same issue. Having a parent who fails to address their own mental health issues can be detrimental to your own health. Just make sure to take care of yourself before you can help anyone else. It’s good that you have a high paying CNA job where you are clearing around $2400 a month.   I think everyone on here is in agreement that the apartment is prob your best source right now. Hotels are extremely expensive and not worth it. Being homeless in your car is not fun as I’ve experienced that as well as living at a campground.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to pray. Pray to God and thank him for all you have now including that job and try to look at the situation with the glass half full. Joining a gym and working out can also help you to take showers and to give you those much needed endorphins.   Just remember everything in life is temporary. Good or Bad. You are being tested and depending on your attitude will ultimately determine how far you will go.   Good luck to you and your Mom and please DM if you need a listening ear. Most people don’t really need advice and already know what they need to do and some do and others don’t.   Godspeed.🙏🏽,Long-Translator1602,3,1,8,1024
j2az44p,Do you work in a good sized facility? If so and there's a bulletin board in the breakroom/s you could post for a ride share. Pay for their gas or offer a flat rate per day.

j2bt638,I agree with most commenters that the apartment is better than the hotel. $300/wk for four weeks a month means that living in the hotel would be like paying $1200 per month in rent_ which I would assume is unaffordable. I agree with the poster who suggested asking around work or putting up a poster to see if coworkers would like to get help with their gas money by driving you to work. That would be a good deal for both parties and something totally reasonable that many people would be willing to do.  &#x200B;  For long-term income for your mom_ I suggest reaching out to an SSI/SSDI Outreach_ Access_ and Recovery (SOAR) provider in your state. (You can find the contact info for your area here: [https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/state-directory](https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/state-directory) ) It's a program designed for people who are experiencing homeless/at risk of homelessness and have a serious mental health condition (like your mom's schizophrenia). If your mom agrees_ they would do all the work to submit an application for federal disability benefits (SSI/SSDI) for her. Even if she's applied before and been denied_ she has a much MUCH better chance of being approved for SSI/SSDI with SOAR help than without. I'm currently doing the training to provide SOAR help to people in my state and the training says that the approval rate on initial application for people with SOAR help is 68%_ versus a 30% general approval rate in 2019.,SparkyDinosaur,2,1,3,1530

j299fe4,I think your best option is to get that cheap apartment for now. Even if you have to pay transportation extra. I think you mentioned you will live alone.

j29ug5k,Are you going to live with your mom if you get that apartment? I’m confused by people on this thread very quick to discard a mom_ a very sick mom no less. I think family is what keeps you from being homeless. How did she manage to keep you housed and fed for 21 years and all of a sudden she’s jobless and penniless? We’re missing the full story_ but I believe in sticking with family_ with the exception of physical and sexual abuse and major drug abuse. Schizophrenia is a beast_ but it is truly a mental health condition that can be helped with professional help and medication. Living alone in a sketchy area is probably more dangerous than with a family member.   Other people have made great suggestions already. No hotel_ yes apartment_ yes food banks.,arealpandabear,0,1,3,1530
j2al2er,Facebook marketplace - rentals - rooms for rent. Some accept two people in one room_ or each to pay for a single room. Prices range from $500 - $1000 a month depending on your location. It is much more affordable than a regular rental_ and there is still a contract and everything so you are protected if anything happens. You can move in a place as soon as the same week_ depending ofc. But there’s usually plenty of options and all you need to have is first months rent and maybe a security deposit. You need to have a job and a way to make it to that job (Uber_ bus_ friend gives you a ride_ etc).,cherribumm,1,1,3,1530

I would look at opportunities to move up to either an activities position or go to nursing school.,synonyco,1,1,8,1024
j2ofmjq,Pay for an apartment_ and forgo being able to go to the grocery store if you have to. Do some research on public transportation_ and see if riding the bus (or similar) will save you some money on your commute.  Get in contact with homeless services to find out where the food banks are_ and access them. Find out if there are any local churches who give food to people in your situation.  It is better to have four walls_ a locked door_ and a bathroom then to have food and be exposed to the trauma of the street.  Even a few months on the street could yield enough violent_ traumatic experiences that could ruin the rest of your life. Do not expose yourself to homelessness if you can help it.,INFOborg,1,1,3,1530
j2b6nv1,Ok_ so_ you're a nurse. Let people in that sketchy neighborhood know you're a nurse. Human nature tends to stop most asshats from messing w nurses and medics.  Get a dog. Get a gun. Get mace. Get a mace. Start practicing Tai Chi because learning Wing Chun on your own will be easier that way_ if you can't afford lessons.   Let everyone in your shady neighborhood know you're practicing the ways of the Shaolin Temple_ just keep it simple.   Talk about how awesome the Five Finger Death Punch from Kill Bill is.   Don't forget to get to know every cop you come across and let them know what neighborhood you live in. Mostly males cops. Play on that 'hero' image male cops cultivate of themselves.  Not only will they be a presence in your neighborhood_ if someone should act stupid around you_ your neighbors will be just as likely to shush them as the cops will be to arrest them.,Clobhairchaun,-3,1,3,1530

j2ak56b,Heat travels upward.  But most cars have little or no insulation on the roof.  Often it is a cloth liner next to sheet metal.  Sometimes there is a lttle padding  So most cars lose lots of heat through the roof.  People insulate the windows because it is obvious_ but often they forget about the roof.  Look for sheet styrofoam.  About 3/4 inch thickness is best.  ( The best source of free sheet syrofoam is the dumpster behind a new furniture store )  Place a sheet of it against the roof.  With a sharp knife and a little patience_ you can make it fit.  Often there are things to support the edges_ like handles or coat racks - so that you can force it in up against the curve of the roof once and it stays there.,ThroarkAway,7,1,11,964

Or drive south_ stop at a homeless service and ask if they have money to help you get to a warmer area.  If you cannot drive to a different area. If you have the money by what's called fun fur or faux fur. It's expensive but it's thick. This way you can hang this around the windows in your car to keep the cold out and the warmth in. You can also use blankets_ towels or even cardboard. Make sure to leave a tiny little crack in the window for air circulation.   Buy thick warm blankets. Or if you have the money_ buy a 0° sleeping bag. They're expensive. Some homeless agencies will provide wool blankets. Not pretty but useful.

j2a5fpk,I lived in my car one winter.  I had 3 blankets and I cocooned myself in them.  It only took a couple of minutes to get warm.  I'd imagine sleeping bags would do a better job of trapping the heat in_ but I was working with what I had at the time.  So maybe try to get your hands on some sleeping bags and layer them.   They will trap in the heat that your body makes.  I wasn't working then_ so during the day I'd go to coffee shops_ restaurants_ libraries_ etc to stay warm and charge my laptop/phone.  Also made friends with someone at the gas station so I had a 24/7 bathroom to use.  They threw out their old donuts at 3am and they just gave them to me.  I would park outside a medical office building so I had wifi.  Prepare to be asked to move along by police or security.  Don't take offense just apologize and go somewhere else. Try to park away from other vehicles.  Don't look suspicious.  I have severe anxiety and it gave me comfort to know that I could survive without all the comforts I was used to_ and even now it gives me a little bit of confidence.,himynameismud,7,1,3,1530

j2ca8gg,Don't get a buddy heater without a carbon monoxide alarm_ or you very well might die.     Get a portable battery like a Jackery to power an electric heating pad for inside your sleeping bag or an electric jacket.      At one point I made plastic cutouts for my windows that I glued black fabric on the outside and reflectix and wool blanket for the inside. They were rigid enough to stay in the windows on their own_ but really helped with insulation. I never did try putting insulation in the doors_ but I bet it would really help.      Find somewhere to park out of the wind_ even near a wall would be helpful. Get plastic water bottles and paint them black_ put them inside your windows full of water_ in direct sunlight. The water will retain heat from the sun for hours after dark.      Get a prius_ they have a very efficient heat pump and the car can be made so that it turns itself on every now and then just long enough to recharge the batteries then shuts the car off again.     Get serious about your layers. Wool under layers are amazing. Gloves_ hats_ wool socks_ etc. You put enough clothes on and you'll be fine as long as you are out of the wind and rain like in a car.     Get a heated mug. If all your liquid intake is nice and hot that will make it much easier to stay warm_ while also keeping you hydrated.     Get a cover for your car_ put a big blanket under the cover even.     Find an outlet you can park next to and run a small discreet extension cable into the car to power a space heater.     Get a generator and mount it on the back hitch.      Find a heated garage to park in.     Get a fluffy dog to cuddle with.  Park somewhere that you can have a fire. Heat water before bed for warm bottles of water in your sleeping bag. Heat up rocks for similar use.,Fwob,3,1,11,964

j293xau,I’m so sorry for what you are going through.  Please try to remember that you are just going through it though_ there will be another side of it-  I remember being lost and hurting in the wilderness_ not seeing a  light at the end of the tunnel…. But I just had to believe that it was there- It is there!  Just pray for God to hold you_ comfort you_ give you strength.  He created you and has a plan for you.  This experience will make you stronger_ teach you things_ and give you a voice and a compassion that most won’t have.   Stay strong_ have courage_ hang onto that hope of your future.  Knowing that You can do this!  Whatever it takes.  And when you succeed_ you will appreciate all you have and you’ll never take it for granted.  Those in your life in the future will also be better off knowing that you are real_ true_ strong_ determined_ and won’t throw it all away by bad choices which so many others to.  Keep working well_ save all that you can!  Try to find a roommate or room to rent_ eat healthy & cheap.  Fill your mind with only good_ positive self talk.  You can do this!!!  Imagine what you want your life to look like in 5 or 10 years… ‘hold on tight to that’.   Then take steps_ even baby steps each day to get there.  Make a plan.  Daily_ weekly_ monthly… in 1 year….  You will succeed. Then this will be a cloudy dream from the past that will serve as a reminder that you can and will always do the right thing to succeed.  You will grow to believe and be proud of yourself_ and that is priceless.  Then others will come into your life_ and you will be at a place where you can embrace that as well.  I am praying for you.  I pray that your heart will be softened so that you can hear the whispers of Christ reminding you that you are made in His image and can do all things through Him.  You are smart and healthy and capable of so much more. You know this; do not let anything blur your vision or bring you down.  Choose peace_ joy_ love_ determination_ thankfulness_ opportunity.   Choose patience_ forgiveness_ kindness_ goodness_ faithfulness_ & self control.  Choose Hope my friend.  You got this.  This is temporary.

j24rqz6,Yes…This World will drive/push honest and caring people over the edge.  What I found most concerning in my Healthcare is that…after leaving one Physician for “pill pushing” I came across other nurses who worked not under that same Doctor_ but another…And were Very Aware of This.   After having experienced the pains and still suffering from lingering side effects of being prescribed medications that were no doubt unnecessary and causing harm…later backed by a Specialist’s medical opinion_ I am in aww at all the health_ time and energy I lost.   It was so much stress. It still is.  Trauma dump…that’s a neat term and hey_ it wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t a need for it.   Look at things this way…I’m 38_ worked for 17 years at the same place_ did military service and deployment_ obtained a Bachelor’s in Education (after like a decade).  Other stories I’ve read…Attorneys_ RN’s and others in healthcare_ many others across different fields in the US….We Are All Having Similar Struggles With The Healthcare System. Why?  I can’t imagine what it’s like going at it from 18 years old_ heck even 25…and trust me 25 is hopefully a lot better!  The hardest thing to do…is learn how to be diplomatic_ if you will.  With Psychiatry…I started reading up on History and Structure…current Director and Past Directors of the National Institute of Mental Health.  Picked up Dr. Thomas Insel’s Audio book_ “Healing_ Our Path From Mental Illness to Mental Health”.  It was enlightening to say the least.  Also_ brushed up on current State lawsuits against select pharmacies.   So_ guess what responses I got from those who where members of my medical in Psychiatry when I asked basic questions relating to what I learned on these points?.  Not talking front desk…I’m talking who’s writing me scripts.  They didn’t know…were not aware of any lawsuits with any pharmaceutical companies_ had no clue who the current director of the NIMH is_ nor any past directors.  I spoke with clinical management…same thing.  This is my experience with the current state of healthcare in the US…it does not appear to be getting better and I am saddened to hear similar stories from many others.  Pro tip: when you’re asked if you have any questions…seems they aren’t happy if you actually have questions…why is that?  Anyhow_ you have to keep things all written down…especially with how the medications you’re prescribed will effect you. It will help greatly to have a consistent person with you at medical appointments and have their notes too.  If an issue comes up…take care of it right away and use what documentation you have to advocate.  You Will Not Be Liked By Staff and The Facility for Doing So_ but…that’s just part of it.  Sometimes_ it comes to a point where you have to seek care from another facility_ find the new one first ( over lap) make sure it’s a good fit_ then discontinue services from previous one.,missfire23,2,2,3,1530

j268er7,"at a certain point insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results.

j233nud,You should any legal questions you have in r/legaladvice  Why not try to get an overnight custodian (or even daytime if you are okay with that) job for now_ but there are other decent jobs as well that require little social interaction:  https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/jobs-where-you-dont-have-to-deal-with-people  You could try data entry as well_ which doesn’t require a lot of social interaction.   I know it is probably stressful right now and you are junking about a million things at once. I don’t know if you have extreme anxiety or your mental health background_ however YouTube videos and Tiktok videos will help tremendously on those.  You should also try to go to a state where minimum wage is high_ but a town inside of the state where cost of living is low. Washington state is a good choice because it has a high minimum wage and there are some good towns with low cost of living. Check out some of the towns on Areavibes:  https://www.areavibes.com/best-places/washington/cost-of-living/  This website will help you compare different towns based on a lot of different metrics. Just click the “Filter” button to see them all.   Also know that for first time homeowners_ you can take advantage of the USDA home loan which gives first time homeowners the oppurtunity at a $0 down home loan. When I had called a representative_ they said they will work with credit_ even though the minimum was 620 at the time and the representative said that all you had to make per month was $1_500 at least in order to become elegible. Here is the map of all of the places you can buy a home with this specific home loan in the US:  https://www.usdaloans.com/program/property-eligibility/  Also_ do you live in a state where you have access to Medicaid?,CriticalPolitical,1,3,3,1530

I then spent 2 years homeless_ living in the Drop In center (DI) in Calgary. After protecting myself from a fight and getting my leg broken_ my parents took me in to recover. After my leg was healthy_ I started volunteering at a thrift store/charity_ then got hired. Then I got lucky_ as my parents bought me a small condo. I got lucky (in a way_ since my parents wanted me to live a tough life before they gave me security)_but now I'll never worry about housing ( I fully own my place).

j1xevpw,There is a sub for RV's.  Can't think of the name right now,Grassyhobo,4,1,11,964
j2d3wmk,For RVs_ one simple bathroom convenience. A compost toilet is super simple. One that works as well as any 500 plus model is super easy to make. Look up tiny house compost toilet on youtube or blogs and you'll find both commercial and homemade units_ and a plethora of info. Screw dealing with blackwater waste.  Buddy heaters are what everyone recommends. I do too. Little Buddy's I don't recommend as they're more temperamental than the standard build Buddy heaters.  For lighting_ the oddest thing is that I've used a BALDR 330 watt power pack. I got lucky to get it for 99 dollars at ebay last year. If you use it only as a light_ in a small area like a 8 x 8 room or a van_ will last weeks upon weeks. I've never fully discharged it using light only. So in a small space_ if you only use it for phone or tablet_ and a light you almost need nothing else. For a laptop_ I'd recommend a steady discharge like a Jackery. Laptops should have their own power station. You can go old fashioned and have a small gas generator_ use it once a week to charge two to four marine batteries_ attached cigarette lighter inverters and adapters will power your devices. I did that for a while. You can likely use the single solar to charge small mppt devices like a BALDR or a Jackery. Even stand alone charge controllers are being made with mppt tech these days_ but the power stations have them built in_ and they're fairly cheap. Solar specific wiring and connections are available_ often in kits.  I'd recommend using those to keep your devices a little safer.  Also doesn't hurt to have one or more of [these](https://www.amazon.com/UCO-Original-Lantern-Candles-Yellow/dp/B000F6NNP8?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1)_ with plenty of candle refills. A hurricane style candle seems much safer than a lantern. Both will contribute to heating in small spaces.

I didn't care I went and got my bag anywhere in law and behold realized that some of my stuff was missing.    Another time around Thanksgiving I was at a shelter and they were serving you know basically crappy turkey and it was spoiled and anyone who tried to say anything they threatened with kicking out.   I was at another shelter where they let the police in and these guys were nothing but unprofessional savages waking us all up demanding IDs and basically treating us like crap.  Another shelter I was in The men were made to go into this basement which basically they told us to sleep on the floor and the women were kept upstairs on nice cots and bunk beds later on we found out some of the male staff were exchanging sexual favors so the women can get better treatment.,johnfro5829,5,1,3,1530

When I became homeless_ when I had life difficulties_ they all turned their backs on me.  Most painful revelation in my life by far.

Basically_ I always called her if she wanted food_ or if she wanted anything from the grocery stores. I always think about her or my family_ and what I can buy them or gift them. Now imagine_ I been asking her to buy me some crackers when she's out_ because they are my favorite.   Then_ she gets mad at me for even asking her to buy me things.  Come to find out_ she's been buying those specific crackers and had 2-3 boxes hoarded in her room without my knowledge. I know this isn't as extreme as helping someone repair their life_ but it's still a similar lesson on a smaller scale.   I guess I learned that when you help someone and are generous_ don't expect that they will repeat the favor. It seems obvious and common sense for someone to repay you the same as you've done to them_ but we live in a very selfish world. People have different personalities_ priorities_ beliefs_ and goals that are entirely different from ours.   One thing I would confess on_ is that she sounds like a terrible person to ask for help.

j1ygxaw,when circumstances arose that caused me to become homeless_ when i was only 19_ everyone i ever loved or knew completely failed me. my parents_ grandparents_ aunts_ my son’s father_ my best friend. nobody gave one single fuck. i was raised in a middle class christian family_ they were extremely abusive but they upheld a “perfect” image_ i guess being homeless ruined the image too much. last time i spoke to my best friend all she said was “youre scaring me” like fr? im scaring you because i have nowhere to sleep yet you can’t offer a helping hand? in your big ass house with three empty bedrooms????    they so much didn’t help that i literally had to adopt strangers as my new family and now i live in a completely different state because it was my only option besides sleeping on the sidewalk. my new mom takes better care of me than my real mom ever did in my entire life. it’s only been a year and a month since i lost everything. i still cry everyday. i really really miss my family_ despite everything.,kayidontcare,2,1,3,1530

When I was in college_ I had a friend go homeless and he was sleeping on the beach- I said hell naw_ you are sleeping on my sofa. It cost me nothing to let him sleep there. Years later_ I became homeless and he sent me $$ I told him I’d pay him back and he refused it saying it’s the least he can do.

j1wraa7,All of these comments have merit and you should take them seriously. The problem is that we were not there when you met them/him. We haven't read the emails or messages. We don't know the area and we don't know your circumstances. My personal opinion is that if there's no Wi-Fi or cell service then that is an absolute no for me.   Are you on disability or trying to get disability or are you trying to get a job? Finding a job in a rural area is a lot harder than the city. Getting disability takes a long time and this definitely sounds temporary   How will you get groceries? mail? To job interviews or doctor's appointments? Are they willing to drive you?  Have you talked about expectations?  Made it very clear that you have no interest in an exchange that is of adult nature?    If you have their phone number or their name I would definitely do a background check. There are some free background checks where you can get very minimal information about the person for free.  Or even just a Google search for that person's name in that area.   If you decide to do this_ absolutely let people know the address and the name of the person that you would be staying with and what the situation is. Make sure to let both groups know that you'll be checking in on a regular basis.    I'm not going to give an opinion against it or for it....

j1z1fiv,Well with Reddit we only get the story from one person’s perspective. Although you can give general advice about relationships and how to preserve your confidence in these types of situations; I think it’s irresponsible to tell someone to leave and ghost their family. Your situation has nothing to do with theirs so you should actually try to help them. I’m 22 and homeless right now and the one thing I learned is to stay in contact with the fam.  Not because they will provide for me or give me things but to let them know I’m alive and if I seriously need help they can somewhat save me.

j1vt0r0,Be on guard. Get a tarp and some rope and on rainy days you can set up a tarp shelter(there are so many different ones. ) And you can wrap your belongings up in it. As far as food lasting since your in the Philippines_I'm not sure what the weather_but/animal/theiving situation is but you could always ask vendors at the the end of the day if they have anything they couldn't sell they might be getting rid of. Talk to store owners and ask if they maybe need someone for od jobs. Explain your situation and maybe so eine will show some conpassion. If it's not too rainy and if you can safely get your kids up rooftops are sometimes great places to sleep.  A sock with rocks in it makes a good legal weapon.  Jeez this is a tough one since most of us don't know your countries laws/rules/social services. Perhaps see if there's any single mothers pages around you on FB or Reddit_ perhaps there's someone looking to share rent on an apartment that might also be close to being in the situation your in. I always hated doing it but there's always begging or asking people to buy you food. Where Im from you could stay full from dumpster food that hasn't gone bad(just past expiry date). Follow your gut instinct.   Do you have any family that might be able to at least watch the kids for a bit if you found some work? My heart goes out to you and your little ones.

j1svfgx,Oh_ yeah that happens sometimes. Depends where you are_ I’ve dealt with shitty GCs and foreman plenty of times. I’ve walked off a job_ called the office and went somewhere else in the same week before. I don’t take too much shit either. Well_ I started with no skills at all_ I learned everything on the job_ including welding and steel fitting. To be honest even learning to read a tape measure I picked up on a job site many years ago_ embarrassing as it is to admit it. Lol. But when I first started it was easy stuff mostly. I asked a ton of questions when I was on the job.   Well_ I can give you some resources if you change your mind. Even if you can do a little stick welding you could probably get started near me around $30 an hour. It’s not for everyone but getting my foot in the door with shipyard work probably saved me. Personally_ I love it_ and some of them pay $50 an hour plus per diem. but there’s other stuff too. I hate when my company sends me to production jobs and things like that.

j1khpvo,The way i see it_ anything that enables him to have food in his belly and a roof over his head is enabling him - to survive. Dead people don't recover_ and it's really hard to get clean when you're homeless and hungry.   I know it can be hard to know exactly where to draw the line. If he has EBT_ you may be best off paying his rent directly to the landlord and phone bill directly to the company (if you/your mother are so inclined. he's very lucky to have family that cares). If he has food and shelter and a phone_ he's in an excellent position to try and get himself together.,Suckmyflats,3,1,8,1024
j1kvsm6,Honestly_ it does sound like you guys are enabling him. I don't personally have a family member that is homeless_ but I do know that homeless people can get free clothes/food from programs or even church outreaches and such. Seems whatever you give him is going towards drugs. STOP giving him money itself. There must come a breaking point where he gets tired and actually wants help. Some addicts just take time to hit that point. The best you can do is keep in contact and remind him how much you love him. You won't help him one ounce feeding his addiction_ he will get the money no matter what_ don't let him have a steady income from you guys.,Sky_hunter,3,1,3,1530
j1kw69q,Yea.  Having a backpack pretty much makes you a mark for being homeless.  And yes a store manager WILL LIE TO YOUR MOTHER if that's what it takes to keep someone homeless out of their store.

j1kdti9,Tough_ tough spot and really feel a bit uncomfortable even commenting.  If you can afford it then it's at least like you're somewhat helping to keep him alive and going but anyone whose living that way isn't living right. If you can call being on the street living   More like surviving. Youre not going to convince your mom to stop being a mother and painful as it is_ yes I think cutting someone ( even loved one) off can be an only choice.  Take everything away_ they hit rock bottom and only have a couple hard choices left. Change_ get it over with or maybe do something really dumb/desperate and wind up incarcerated.  At least they'd have food_ shelter and a chance to change. You can't save someone from themselves. Think sometimes the issue has to be forced_ a person left w no other choice than do what they must_ either way.  Oops_ another edit. If/when they start making a real and sincere effort to get better.

j1t3enh,It sounds like you may be looking for items to provide to an organization that serves homeless folks to give to people.  If that's the case_ asking the org what they need is best.  I worked with one and sometimes we needed men's underwear_ other times it was cold medicine_ it depended on what was in demand and what we already had.  We never needed socks_ because every school_ scout troop and church collected socks for the homeless.  We had over 2000 pairs of socks at one point_ and every year we'd end up with more than we started.  We handed out a lot of socks...we just got more than we gave out.    One of the most in demand things turned out to be meal bags with a variety of items_ all ready to eat along with plastic utensils and a plate and paper towels.  All bags had a main course item (pop-top beef ravioli_ Vienna sausages_ tuna/chicken kits with crackers)_ Slim Jims_ peanut butter packets_ candy and/or cookies and water and 100% juice boxes_ raisins or applesauce_ pudding cups.,adlpated,2,1,3,1530
j1l0f8q,There was no judgement expressed in the OP_ they just said they didn’t want to give money. They never said they didn’t think homeless people could be trusted with cash and they didn’t say they were concerned that cash would be spent frivolously.   There are plenty of reasons why someone might want to give something other than cash. Some people just don’t like giving cash as a gift_ some people feel like it’s impersonal_ utilitarian. My stepmother is like that; to her it’s rude to give cash as a gift because it shows that you didn’t want to put any thought or effort into it.,MrsDirtbag,8,2,3,1530

I paid rent_ helped with other household expenses_ and did chores and errands. It wasn't fun_ but it gave me stability to do my job and let me save up for my own place.

What if that month becomes extended for whatever reason?   I have been in this situation and found that the weekly stays were not only painfully expensive but also in the worst locations. I happily spent money on insulating my car and went that route for what I had anticipated would be 2 maybe 3 weeks. The deal fell through and it became months with no end in sight. I can without a doubt say I made the right decision to take that route even though to everyone else it seemed crazy.,Cool_Jackfruit_4466,1,1,3,1530
j1jcpst,"From what I noticed in the location I am in. The only time I see somewhat ""afforadble"" motels are when you go in towns/cities that not a plethora of individuals are locating too. The places that are not known for tourism_ or have a booming industry of some sort. But this comes off with a significant trade off because most of the times (from my experience and observations) these places lack sufficient opportuntites and resources because of a lack of individuals coming into these places.    It is somewhat of a no win situation in certain places.   Motels in these places are also rising over the past year alone. I had a coworker at a former job in May of this year who was living in a local motel who raised their prices from approximately $750ish per month_ to around $900ish I believe. It is insane because just several years ago_ you could have rented motels in my hometown for only $650ish a month.   For example_ if you live in a big city such as Seattle_ then the motel prices will be off the charts. But if you live somewhere like Mount Pleasant MI a place where not many people know of_ the motel prices would be significantly lower than in bigger cities_ however the lack of opportuntities there is possibly why people do not go to towns such as that.",Markie199711,1,1,3,1530

j1i208y,I think the most helpful think you can do is to get to know one unhoused individual. Sit down with them where they are or invite them to meet you for lunch or coffee (if you’re a bit wary and want others around). Ask them what would be helpful - clothes? Shoes? A gas card? Help getting an ID? Or if you sense that they have untreated mental illness or addiction_ research places that can help and if they are willing_ help them jump through the administrative hoops to access those resources. If they are unwilling_ try to continue to develop a friendship with them. Be a support_ a person they can talk to_ and someone they can go to when they are ready to move forward. Definitely set boundaries (never give anyone cash)_ and be discerning as to who you give rides to. But I would say that one of the main causes of homelessness is isolation from healthy family_ friends and folks who can help - and we can all work to do something about that 🙂.,pppches,4,1,11,964

I suppose it’s different for everyone: time_ schedule_ safety_ area_ what resources are available_ who’s with you etc.  I’m middle aged_ unhealthy_ small male. Still_ I’ve learned that it’s easy to cause someone to panic if you approach them…so I don’t do that anymore.   You just don’t know what someone has been through and in hindsight after being on here…enough…pretty sure the guy got his stuff stolen from him recently_ which would explain why he was carrying what little he had in his shirt.   Pretty much I just kinda let things unfold as natural as possible. I’ll give a warm greeting and what not and sometimes a conversation follows_ sometimes not.  If you end up talking_ you get a chance to ask what is needed and if you can bring it by or in some cases drop it safely.,missfire23,2,1,3,1530
j1lqbdm,"Your heart is definitely in the right place_ particularly this being Christmas and all. When I (42 year old man with cerebral palsy) used to work for a homeless services organization_ I certainly could have been taken advantage of_ even as it was my city; an area I am all too familiar with. The fact that I wasn't meant two things to me: first_ that the homeless human beings that I encountered were appreciative of my assistance and 2: realize that had taken advantage of me_ they may not have been helped as they were.  I said all of that to say that homeless individuals do get a bad rap; most are just trying to get by_ like you and I. The difference being that the streets are tough: That's where the development of ""street smarts"" comes in.  Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen or something. And you might find out that a large contingent of that population hangs out at the local McDonald's or the local library at around this or that time. Maybe you bring your boyfriend along. So you go to the library and find a way to strategically Introduce yourself. I say it's strategically_ because you need to be safe and careful. But once you've got an ""in_ just talking about their experience is helpful. They want to be seen, just like everybody else. All of this is predicted on your own personal safety being paramount. If you don't feel safe, you might want to try a different approach.

Wondering if there's anything else good to add. Also trying to find the best places to hand stuff out, I feel like maybe good spots to check would be bus stations and in front of grocery stores as those are currently the only spots I've run into people who can use the kits...

zty42w,j1hggx1,,There are two gudjuwaras in Connecticut. They have phone numbers and it's likely they'd help you stay warm and fed, including getting there and parking up, because that's their thing. It's one avenue of help that you haven't mentioned yet, so...  Any non-leaking container that you can fill with hot water and wrap in a towel is a survival tool. Also, if you can get paper, crumple it up and shove it inside your shoes and clothes. Keep your head covered at all times. Wearing a mask will warm the air that you're breathing in, so you lose less. Keep hydrated. You need nearly as much water as if it was really hot - keep your urine straw-coloured, not too pale (or you'll go more often and lose more heat). You need that water to burn fat to stay warm. You also need any calories you can get.  Beg people for coffee, not money for coffee. Hot drinks will also help you keep alive. Ask for hot water too, to fill whatever you're using as a hot water bottle. You probably look like shit with the health problems and anxiety, so nobody is going to want to give cash the way they will if you look healthier, which is just the catch-22 you're stuck in.  However much you can move without collapsing entirely, move that much. If you start shivering and can't get under more cover/insulation you have, then you don't have long left to live and you can either die in your car or ditch it for the ER to not, you know, die. So get mentally ready for life getting even worse than it already did. Let's hope it doesn't.

zty42w,j1vwnth,,This is capitalism. I just saw that many froze to death in Buffalo but, the msm is only counting deaths not saying how the narcissism and cruelty of this system is responsible.  They hide the deaths and real reasons for them.  Homeless are going to die enmasse as even the system supposedly to help the homeless is middlemen consultants and those scumbags peeling off much of the tiny available funds to enrich themselves.  This system is broken and killing its citizens while sending money for their war overseas and pretending to have done everything they can.  Pure Evil.    Im sorry we as a country are too narcissistic to do more than pray.  The lack of actual empathy mixed with apathy and the desperation of the rest too destroyed to even attempt to help anyone else is growing.   We normalized narcissism part is that we wont acknowledge problems until they hit us and then there is no one to help us. Even the narcissism of the masses is very much from being victimized by a predatory system of greed.  The narcissism begets more narcissism.   Weve failed as a country and have just begun the decent. Im sorry we failed you.
zty42w,,j1vx6o0,I was about to say that!! It’s very unfortunate people are dying out there
zty42w,j1i7o9s,,I’m so sorry. I’m kind of in the same boat. I have a job but all my paycheck just goes too hotel rooms!! Once my stay is gone I might freeze too death
zty42w,,j1igb2a,Omg I hope things get better and don't have to deal with that
zty42w,j1glw92,,I lived outside the last 2 winters in Canada. It's very doable. You need the gear though. You NEED a winter sleeping bag. That's it. It IS doable, just not easy. Good luck buddy.  Edit: I wrote my advice before reading the comments. People, living outside in the winter is very doable. Fuck, every homeless person in  Canada does it. Not easy, but very doable.
zty42w,,j1gqb1t,Yes, it's about the right tools for your situation.  I was without a dwelling for over a year in interior Alaska. The arctic sleeping bag is important, proper layers, tarps, wind breaks, tent  etc . But is it possible for OP to get a sub zero bag and good tent?
zty42w,,j1imz8a,I was very lucky to live in a place with a ton of homeless support. I once had my sleeping bag stolen, I left it for like a minute. I got a better one from the local shelter within a day. People here help a lot. Kept me going. Just been off the street for a month. Very grateful I am, the system actually helped me. I will forever care about the homeless though. My friends are still on the street.
zty42w,,j1gomco,I'm so sorry you have to deal with that
zty42w,j1hdhuz,,There's other forums on reddit for people who're straight up just asking for money, which is what this is.  You're getting to the point you're being openly hostile to any advice, and there's many solutions that will work, at least well enough to get you through the night.    &#x200B;  Also, you DO have to have some sense when you're homeless, you can't wait until you're in an extremely dangerous situation to be planning your move.  You should, barest minimum, have an appropriate sleeping bag, winter clothing, and blankets for the situation.    It sounds like you have a car so you should have been panhandling to get your ass either to Florida, South Arizona, or South Cali \*MONTHS AGO\*!  I'm aware that you're overdue on car payment and insurance payment, but still getting somewhere warm should take high priority over everything else.    &#x200B;  I've watched you go from indifferent reasons to why these ideas won't work, to hostile about why these ideas won't work, all the way to OPENLY hostile about why these ideas won't work and saying that money is the only the solution"".  You're begging.  And the general tone sounds a lot like begging to feed a severe drug addiction.  You think us people who've done time homeless haven't seen that before?  It's pretty obvious once you've seen it a few times.  Go to the crowdfund or assistance forums.  Be more polite and more grateful on them.  You go using this tone and no one will give you a damn thing because you're sounding like a crackhead who needs a rock.  &#x200B;  If you aren't begging for a fix_ I apologize for saying that_ but you can't wait until the deep cold to leave cold frozen winter states.  You should have got somewhere warm by early November.  Poor planning when you're homeless_ can and will_ result in death.  You're gonna have to be smarter about things.",GeekDE,1,1,3,1530
j1hrp77,I second your opinion. OP's tone is just... something is off. The only time OP had anything nice to say was when they mentioned someone gave them money on r/mustang. Big red flag there. Seems like OP is getting frustrated that people are handing out advice instead of cash app. It's literally the first rule of this sub_ do not give ppl money here. I'm not sure about it being for drugs tho.  All that being said_ is this really how bad the services are in the US? I'm homeless in Canada. This is my 2nd month. I have a bed that's reserved for me as long as I show up by a certain time. There is at least 1 meal a day from the churches. The shelter usually does a light snack for breakfast. Donated clothes. Donated toiletries. I get a small stipend from the province. Housing in about 6 months. Applying for disability.  If this is the typical situation in the US_ I'm really sorry you have to go through that. Take care everyone.,Faketrees2223,9,2,3,1530
j1hxmyg,It depends on where you are in the nation how good the service will be to the homeless.  In some areas (usually Republican controlled areas)_ help is virtually non existent.  Some areas have a fairly extensive help network_ which also results in attracting much more homeless in that region.  Though I don't know anywhere in the US that sounds quite as good as what you have.  I don't know of any \*safe\* (key word) shelters that just has a reserved bed every night ready to go.    &#x200B;  It sounds like OP is in a particularly bad area for government help for the homeless.  It also sounds to me like she has exhausted all her friends/relatives who will lend her money (people are always much more eager to help homeless women than men_ that's why you see far less homeless women).  So since she's not used to the hoops you have to jump through to get help from the government and charities_ she's just asking for money.  If she wants to be homeless_ for long_ she's gonna have to move somewhere warm where the government helps the homeless more.  South California is a popular choice.  South Arizona as well.,-Ok-Perception-,6,3,6,521
j1h3sl8,This is another thread where the OP is going to argue with every advice offered....,Shayshay4jz,17,1,8,1024
j1hcsqd,NONSENSE advice? That’s your take away from all the different ideas people have shared?  I know I shouldn’t bother wasting my time with this reply when you are clearly either delusional or straight up stupid but the irony is just so fucking silly to me.   Idk what tickles me more. The fact you’re tryin to talk shit to people trying to help OP or that your comment is quite possibly the most WORTHLESS possible reply possible seeing as you offered absolutely zero advice yourself .   OP clearly is convinced money is the only possible solution to this problem of “freezing to death.” You gonna help with that then?? or just bitch at people trying to help? Stay worthless.,xBadxMouthxBitchx,1,1,8,1024
j3qtq4f,Keep in mind_ instead of trying to help themselves. OP is sitting on Reddit_ complaining crying and taking no advice.

j1joprw,Imo hypothermia is a nice way to go.  Whats worse is losing fingers and toes due to frostbite.  There was a homeless lady who got both her feet amputated due to frostbite.  Life after that is much worse than just falling asleep forever from hypothermia. Just my opinion.  Do whatever you need to do to keep your extremities warm.,Glass-Blacksmith-861,2,1,3,1530
j1gcww0,There are churches everywhere and they are all open this time of year! Go see if they really mean what they preach,Ok-Orchid281,5,1,0,144
j1izf46,“Go see if they really mean what they preach” this is the actual answer. Don’t call them_ show up. Find a church in your area_ go to Sunday service. Leave your pride at the door. A Unitarian service would be my choice…  Christmas falls on a Sunday this year_ so there’s a pretty good chance church’s will be serving a potluck lunch. You should be able to find this out by looking at the church’s calendar online. Humbly stand up in front of the congregation and explain to them your situation. Churches themselves may be low on funding_ but the entire body of the church is not.   The shame of not helping you in an open forum_ will overwhelm any reservations about not providing you assistance. Trust me this will work. If it doesn’t_ got to an evening service at a different religious Organization. - Best to you.,oliphantPanama,2,1,8,1024
j1h43vd,It sounds like it's time to leave that place_ but to do that_  you need to stay alive and you need funds. Please seek out any public place you can to get out of the cold. The Red Cross has warming centers during really harsh times. But you need money too. If Doordash is out_ can you make content on your phone? Videos_ blogs_ a video journal on YouTube about your life and what you're going through? Enough subscribers could turn everything around for you.  Collect donations via PayPal? Could you get a Patreon account? Heck_ I might even do foot fetish videos if I really needed the money! When I was in my 20s I worked as a life drawing model at a community college to make ends meet and from there l got a lot of local artists as clients_ who paid cash each session. I won't say it was easy money_ but it's a venerable old job and I was rather proud to see some of the work that came from it. For that_ I literally just walked in and gave the woman who ran the art department my name and number. Best go through someone like that and stay safe- don't Craigslist it or anything like that! It's not for everyone_  but if you don't mind being nude for art_ it can keep you alive. Not sure if you can donate plasma or not_ but a number of folks on here do that to get fast cash. The key thing is finding strength from somewhere_ finding out what you can offer_  and not giving up. You never know what's next or how your life might change. Good luck.,jemflower83,2,3,8,1024

They had been hiding the eviction notices from me. Refused to pay me back the rent I paid to them.

j1k66pr,My wife left me_ and I lost the will to live. Without her_ there is no beauty in the world. Food has no taste and music is just noise. My live truly has no meaning or purpose. I am broken beyond what words can describe.  The day she had the divorce papers served_ I was working from home. It was a Friday. I finished up my call_ closed my laptop_ and never signed in again. My whole world collapsed.  I was an IT consultant. I made over $100k per year. I’m not bragging_ I’m just giving the facts. I traveled Monday through Thursday to various parts of the US every week for work. And I gave it all up without a second thought.  I lived in my car for a while. Drove around the country. For some people_ that would have been exciting_ but for me_ I was just driving. I hardly remember any of it. I was just driving each day_ and sleeping in the trunk of my car each night_ hoping for a miracle. But that miracle never came.  I lived in my car for awhile. Then_ after a month of freezing my ass of in Minnesota_ I stayed in hotel rooms for a couple of months (using the “hotel points” that I had accumulated working as a traveling consultant). Eventually_ I got an apartment and spent a year sleeping on a yoga mat and living life through my phone. And when my money began to run out_ I became homeless.  I’m currently living in a small bivvy tent just outside Tulsa_ Oklahoma. I have enough money to eat_ but that won’t last forever.  I have nowhere to turn for help. My family is extremely toxic and devoid of love. My friends are either screwed up in their own ways_ or they have this own lives. I’m sure I could go to them if I had a plan_ but I don’t. I just want to do nothing_ forever.  I am exhausted beyond words. I just lay in my tent all day. Sometimes I walk to the nearest convenience store to get some food. Sometimes I’m too exhausted to even look at my phone. I just want to sleep forever. I don’t want to be here anymore.  I’m a good person. I don’t do drugs or drink. I don’t even drink caffeine (because it triggers my anxiety). I don’t steal. I’m not violent. I try to be kind to everyone I meet_ even when I’m hurting inside. I made mistakes in the past_ but years of introspection have helped me to understand the root cause of those bad behaviors so that I never repeat them again. I just want to be loved. I just want to be with my wife again.  Before you judge me to harshly_ please consider this: We all experience the emotion of love in different ways_ and we all experience loss in different ways. Some people will be sad for just a day or two_ some will be broken for a few months and then slowly recover_ and some - like me - will be utterly and completely broken.,Darkness_Deluxe,2,1,3,1530

j1eww1k,What's the medication?  You can take it a few hours before appointments so they think you're compliant.  But otherwise there's no reason to take it if it isn't helping.,plidek,5,1,11,964
j1f17nv,Okay_ that makes sense.   It would be a massive red flag for them to start with Seroquel_ as you usually have to try at least 2 other drugs first.

That was a shitty shelter_ I'm sorry you went through that,nip_pickles,4,1,3,1530
j1f8djf,I’m sorry that happened to you. Double standards. If any person who wasn’t experiencing homelessness cancelled an appointment_ nobody would care. They feel like they can control you because they feel you need them and they have the upper hand. Unfortunately they don’t care that you’re an adult who can make decisions about your own mental health and your own life.,AnnaBear6,3,1,3,1530
j1ew686,That was pretty rude and patronizing. I understand they want you to go to the appointmenty because they see to many people give up so easily.

Last winter we had over half a month of days below -30   Wool Socks. Balaclava as it covers the one part exposed that usually isn’t: the face Thermal underwear  Mitts if things Gets below 0 to -5   Depending on weather and their situation  Emergency blanket_ another blanket or even a sleeping bag. Any are good  I’m summer we have to deal with keeping Hydrated to stay safe   In the winter it’s the opposite You don’t want to be dehydrated but you don’t sweat much/anything out and the more water in your system the more energy your body will use to keep your pee warm_ because water inside your body that isn’t heated would freeze people to death or give hypothermia pretty quickly in freezing temps. Inside or on the skin surface.   Again depending  On situation_ a heated blanket or a heater and extension cord if they have shore power.    Hot meals like Soup or something warm especially when warm liquid really feels nice on the insides.,FlyingTerrapin71,1,1,8,1024

j1c3kck,In the United States the resources available to homeless people vary a *lot* from state to state_ even from county to county_ or city to city. Some resources are provided by the government_ sometimes resources are available through non profit organizations. The eligibility for different resources varies too; sometimes you need to be referred in order to access certain resources.   The only thing that seems mostly universal that is available to *most* people in *most* states is EBT or food stamps. The amount you can get and how long you can get them varies a lot though. The fact that there isn’t a simple_ universal set of benefits that all homeless people can receive is one of the reasons it can be so hard trying to get help.   I have no idea how it compares to aid for immigrants_ I’m not at all familiar with that.,MrsDirtbag,9,1,3,1530
j1jsanw,"Texas here: unless you are working 20hrs/wk or can prove you have a disability_ you only get 3mos of SNAP/foodstamps every THREE YEARS. Many homeless adults have psych or substance issues and they can't navigate the paperwork. To make it worse_ the Texas Department of Health and Human Services is running MONTHS behind. Those who should qualify for emergency benefits (within 24hrs) are left in the cracks. There is weird legislation with the pandemic but many programs are AVAILABLE but not funded. So_ I've seen a domestic violence shelter turning away families when they had space available. The Texas Attorney General messed up and put a garnishment on my disability benefits (not uncommon) for child support when my children have separate benefits through the federal government and it's been preventing me from qualifying for ""public housing"" because my monthly income is more than $0 but less than the SSI amount for indigent disabled. This is happening to veterans_ too. Working means losing medical benefits (Medicaid pays my Medicare co-pays and deductible and premiums) and my 20% would have been more than I can feasibly earn.   My suicide attempt would have been ~$80K for my portion. I wanted to die but I'm too valuable as a conduit of federal dollars to for-profit healthcare. They went to extremes to bring me back to life_ court order me to inpatient treatment and then release me to a homeless shelter. I wish I were kidding.",I_Want_A_New_Life_,1,1,3,1530
j1e0dti,As someone that just started working in housing it is extremely confusing (for no good reason). I'll try to break this down without jargon: every region/city/state is responsible for setting up a non-profit that annually submits a single grant application on behalf of all homeless service providers in the area. This organization is also responsible for collecting data about individuals and families experiencing homelessness within their area_ which is submitted with that application to justify the funding requests. There are a lot of ways this approach fails the same people it is supposed to serve:  - Most of the providers are non profits_ not government agencies. This means that there's pretty low compliance with all parts of the process_ from collecting accurate data - through to actually delivering the services promised. And no one to really hold them accountable because...  - The lead agency is also a non profit_ not a government agency. Most are chronically ill equipped to enforce the stipulations of the grant funding.  - There's no formal way to create more providers in an area if they are deemed necessary. This means lots of places have patchy services_ often run by religious groups that use discriminatory practices.  To me (who's only been working for a lead agency for about 4 months) this feels super hands-off and ineffective for such a serious problem. On that note_ the federal government does provide a LOT of funding opportunities if the lead agency can get their shit together and keep providers in compliance. Most don't discriminate between citizens_ refugees_ or immigrants (legal or otherwise) when they offer services... but there are some specialized providers_ especially if there is a high need in the area.   Most places will have...  - domestic violence shelters for women and children (hopefully men too but it's less common) - veterans services (us armed forces only) - overnight emergency shelters for various populations - permanent supportive housing projects for individuals with disabilities - rapid rehousing projects to help place recently evicted folks into empty housing units - temporary housing projects with various types of social services built into the program to help folks achieve stability - outreach programs that run various kinds of drop in centers or travel around to do street outreach. - some places also have refugee resettlement agencies (mine has these_ including agencies that help folks who've been trafficked.)  If you want to learn more about these_ check out the HUD Exhange: https://www.hudexchange.info/. You're free to DM me too if you have more questions_ and I'll do my best to answer them.,the__mom_friend,3,1,3,1530
j1e3804,In what country? Crossing what border? Here in Sweden you have to be drug free to get any help more or less_ but once you are you can get both shelter and apply for your own apartment eventually,artonion,2,1,3,1530
j1etemq,I've been thinking of a homeless app on and off for years now. I may combine it with a fun charitable app I had in mind_ but will need more resources,Acceptable-Spot4705,2,1,3,1530
j1g5uk3,There’s also a huge gap between what is or might be available and what folks are actually able to access. I consider myself a lot more aware than many of what resources exist (I’ve been disabled and impoverished for many years_ homeless the last 7 months.) and I’ve repeatedly been in situations where the social worker or case manager whose job it is to help me isn’t even aware of the programs I’m informing them exist.   It’s actually accessing those resources that’s the problem. I’ve had so dang many issues with all manner of problems and incompetence with the Department of Human Services. Like mistakes made on their end. At least with DHS you eventually get some level of response. I’ve found many places that offer aid don’t even return calls or do the things they say they will.   I’m well aware of things that exist that could help me tremendously. I just can never seem to actually access them. And just about any time I’ve ever managed to access any benefit- even including my social security disability- I figured it out entirely on my own and did it with no help. It’s wild how many times people whose job it is to help don’t manage to get me anywhere at all. And often_ good luck even accessing the case manager or benefits coordinator or whatever in the first place.   That’s what I see as the biggest problem of all. I can’t know for sure what it’s like for immigrants or refugees and such but it seems like there’s always so many people willing to help those folks navigate their options. I’ve seen a lot of local community and religious based organizations be allowed focused on immigrants while having no resources to help their own community members access similar services and help.,Tzipity,2,1,3,1530

We said we needed toilet paper and water and …  we reported the animals_ the scorpions in there. There were scorpions_ ants_ ticks_ fleas and they would tell us that it was fine_ it was because of our own stink of being there 45 days.”  At least in most homeless shelters in the US_ you are not shoved in a cramped cell and forced to wallow in a layer of shit and insects.,Lapamasa,1,5,9,1231

j1d2cyw,Well I guess we need a good sense of humor to read it then. My dad wrote a lot and some of his writing is as a character with his memories but the voice of this guy named Tony. He grew up poor in a family of 11 including his parents and joined the police department when he met my moms family who were all police. He did it for 20 years then went out on a mental disability. He started his own chimney sweeping business where he mostly did restaurants and some houses. He would wear a big black top hat like they did in the 1800-1900's. Sometimes would make me embarrassed. I would give anything now to see that ridiculous hat. There were so many people at his funeral and wake showed me how much of an impact he had.

j16xrd5,Would this be a for-profit or non-profit? Two really big differences. Each one has complications and a complex structure and making it actually happen. Do a lot of research on what kind of permits you would need as a for-profit and a non-profit. Look at other organizations that does something similar_ even if it's a non-profit. As a non-profit_ you would be required to have a board of directors that is one of the requirements for an official non-profit organization. For a non-profit it would open you up to grants and sponsorships. But the same can be true for for profit. But a for profit business organization cannot apply to a non-profit grant. And vice versa for the non-profit. I like the concept but make sure to do your research.,Antique_Radish8823,2,1,3,1530

You can also get stuff from goodwill_ just don't buy clothes from there and if you do keep them in a plastic bag and wash them before using.  If you live in a city with a Target their flatware sets and plates etc are decently cheap and hold up extremely well.  Others have mentioned facebook etc. If you get a bed make sure it has feet and place traps under the feet and get mattress and box spring covers too. Do NOT trust building management about anything bedbug wise_ especially in the USA. also do not buy or trust anything off of Craigslist_ facebook or any of the other sites without inspecting it completely for signs of infestation.,Maverick_Wolfe,1,1,3,1530

But it’s still uncomfortable_ and it sucks spending the whole day in darkness huddled under the blankets to stay warm.

I slept in my coat for the week. The heater I have didn't work all that well. It felt more like a hearing blanket heater.  Air was pouring down from out of the faulty windows. I said to myself having the flue and the shivers_ God will see me through this. One day their will be an end to this misery. I still pray every day to get housing. It seems like a dream almost and something out of reach. Obviously after an accumulated 40 years of homelessness_ I just said pray. Just put news paper over the drafty windows_ and keep on praying.

It's minus 33 real feel where I'm at rn and I'll be shocked if nobody freezes through this storm_ I doubt I could make it a mile on foot in this with my reasonably prepared boots and coat and balaclava without frostbite lol_ even fully geared snowboarders ain't going out today. I bet you'd need 1-2k worth of clothes alone to make it though the day outside. I don't like camping under 40 degrees Fahrenheit_ I mean do you guy but if it was me_ and I am not a fan of shelters either_ I would travel somewhere warm where I can camp for winter.,Decent_Froyo_5530,2,1,3,1530

j19ke6h,The issues you’re dealing with are exactly why a lot of us steer clear of shelters. Winter camping is certainly do-able as long as you have decent gear. One of the most important things that is often overlooked is to put some insulation or padding underneath you. The ground is the biggest thief of warmth. I always scrounged pieces of carpet from the dumpster of a flooring store and placed it under my tent as well as on the floor of the tent. On top of that put a mattress or sleeping pad. I always got nice mattresses from the curb in nice areas_ they’re a pain to haul but you only have to do it once.,MrsDirtbag,2,1,3,1530

j153qo4,I know your local shelter will have information on fostering while you stay at a shelter (I haven't been to many that allow animals). Fostering is just a temporary measure_ someone looks after your pets until you are able to secure housing. As for that_ look into your local resources through findhelp.org and calling 211. Not going to lie_ san Diego_  much like most of CA_  is running low on resources so be sure to call up your local churches as well.  Good luck!,ladyinatent,4,1,3,1530
j1ebprb,There are many SRO’s that you could afford as well as Independent Living Facilities. Contact PATH People Assisting The Homeless and get a caseworker. The number is online. There is a shelter downtown run by Alpha Project. It’s called a bridge shelter. Call them and see if they have beds. San Diego is also opening a hotel downtown and turning the rooms into a shelter for seniors. I believe it’s opening right after the new year. There is also a shelter on the grounds of the County Psychiatric Facility in the Midway District. There is a shelter in East County called East County Transitional Living. All of these accept pets. But you have to register your dog as an emotional support animal. If you call the shelter they will tell you what websites you can use. You are basically buying a fake certification but I think it’s for the shelters liability. Good luck. You can message me if you have any questions. Oh and of course apply for Cal Fresh and Medi Care by calling 211. They can get you approved on the spot.,Western-Cucumber9851,3,1,8,1024

j16suts,My friends good friend house went on fire. The Red Cross was supposed to help her with her Cat that she raised as a kitten and was rescued. They hadn't helped her or her tenant.  I went to the blessing of the animals in 2017 around the same time this happened. I meet a_ woman in a Shelter with two dogs. She said they live there with her in the Shelter. I looked for resources for shelters prior to meeting this woman. I could not find any shelter that allowed animals except Domestic Violence Victims.  If you get Service Animal Certified for your Dog_ and Emotional Support Animal for Your Cat_ by Law the Shelter cannot discrimate.. However in California_ I am told that there is a waiting list to get into a Shelter. Your best bet is to take out a_ loan and buy a easy towable tiny house. They are as low as $35_000 for an off grid and fully equipped with water caught system. They can be towed with most any car. Very low weight bearing. You can then buy a job. They have places that will take the first weeks pay as satisfaction for finding you a job. You can also do canning. Collecting cans and bottles and cashing them in. Set up you stand to sell interesting items you find_ of course after cleaning them up.  Remember without housing you really can't be effective. You can't work contribute to society_ or even help yourself. Incredible Tiny Homes have a product called an In-Cred-I Box. For sixteen feet_ you get a complete home. They even have financial information to help you buy the house.  Being homeless and a senor citizen is a bitter life. It means a very shorten life span. Aggravation_ and humiliation. Getting out of that situation means getting up and going ready for action before it is too late.,Internal-Ad-9390,1,1,3,1530

This will help a lot with saving money that could go towards finding a place/bills.   - Search up Restaurants_ maybe you could find a job being a dishwasher. They are always looking from what my friends say.   - Try to see if you can apply to Uber or Door-Dash on a bicycle if you can.   - Try maybe a Skateshop maybe someone wil take you in.   - I don’t know how recycling cans works in your country but you could recycle cans from hotspots around town or city with a full covered mask on to cover your identity.

j16q5r3,Start a Go Fund Me Page from the Go Fund Me App_ and get everyone who knows you involved with the App. Buy a Tiny House Trailer that can sleep a lot of people or else a small house that can sleep a lot of people. Also stop acting out. Don't make a bad situation worse. I was homeless as a child. I told my friends. They couldn't help me. When you are young there is hope However_ when you get in your middle years_ and older and become homeless it is a disaster. You can't recoup as well. Youth is on your side and hope. Older folks don't have that much hope after being homeless for decades. Getting housed is left to some_ who will work day in and out_ even a few hours a day to find resources. Go Fund Me is the last resort when all else fails.,Internal-Ad-9390,1,1,3,1530

j15mdph,Unfortunately I think you are right but it’s not limited to sports it’s a nationwide issue that effects many interests and demographics. But yeah we are neighbours and some of that sounds similar to Canada. You avoid some of that right wing ignorant BS and it’s replaced with some non sensical Socialist views from a government who wants it run entirely through them to the point they gatekeeper peoples ideas so that it can’t pass and then they just do it themselves. Bureaucracy at its finest lol. It’s socialist but wants everything run through the government so it’s authoritarian.  That’s why so many Americans seem to like PP(Pierre polievre) the Conservative party leader  He’s not so ignorant right for the most part_ but condemns a lot of the left wing actions like the “woke movement” the mismanaging of funds and overpayments to liberal tied organizations and friends   He’s still got a few real ignorant way right views but to compare to the ignorant right views in the states he’s not far right at all. I’m voting Con this time around because I hate Trudeau and he’s done a poor job and Pierre is left enough for a right winger that I agree with a lot of his views being that I’m fairly central on the spectrum.

She is a lousy worker but the cold nights in the car is helping motivate her to work and become self sufficient.

His story is one that has been repeated in multiple cities and is continuously debated on how to help these people or how to get these people to accept help to get them off the street.   One question. Is it possible to try to force him into conservatorship under your family so that you can have him put into a temporary mental health facility in hopes that he will learn that he must help himself?   As someone else suggested. Give him a tent_ blankets & also resources and let him hit rock bottom. Unfortunately do not allow him to stay with your family.

In all_ as a good person_ you should just get him a cheap travel trailer_ camper van and let him know if he smashes it up_ he_ will have no place to live.  You will find out how disciplined he will become. Even with his thoughts and behavior. Holding on to someone and controlling them can make you sick and him sicker. At some point_ he will have to be the person who realizes he needs_ help and make_ his_ own discussion to help himself. Not owing anyone money_ looking out for himself and living his own life ends up being way better than folks hanging on to him. Also let him know_ that if he goes to jail or prison_ no one will be there for him. You leave him alone_ and he will leave you alone and live his life,Internal-Ad-9390,-1,1,3,1530

To use tx as an example_ Google will say you have to be here for a year to be a resident_ but in the food stamps sub I was told that if a person arrives today with the intent to stay here_ that is sufficient for their purpose_ but warned me it might be better to get food stamps where you are and then transfer them. Because of differing rules from state to state. Tx doesn't let non disabled people have them for more than three months unless you work at least 20 hours or engage in workforce activity for 20 hours_ and we're not the only state with such rules.

Even just in those 2 years things have gotten a lot worse. There’s so many of us now and the normies are out of patience and sympathy. I feel like the non profits that are supposed to help us aren’t managing their resources very well. Plus the high cost of living here makes it almost impossible to get off the streets without government aid or subsidized housing. It’s not the worst place you could be_ but it’s far from easy mode.

j12lbs6,The Best Place to go to if you are homeless is New York City. Their is a limited supply of Middle Class people. The fight to keep people poor and on Welfare is a big Deal that no one talks about. Just find an intake Shelter and then after two weeks your are assigned a Shelter which has Case Managers.  New York does not supply much housing. They mostly have shelters. They call these shelters housing. Most folks don't take New York seriously for permanent housing. They boost about home ownership and reaching homeownership goals. Don't bet on it.  Consider it a temporary place until you get a foothold into a state that provides real housing opportunities. Beware of cliches about housing opportunities. It's all just talk.,Internal-Ad-9390,1,1,3,1530

j13gw1q,He's using an old stone foundation as a backstop and put up a wind block opposite of the foundation. Fire goes in between the backstop and windbreak_ he sleeps between fire and backstop. Fire heats up the stone wall and radiates it back to him. He has a few tarps above backstop for rain shelter but it doesn't go far enough out from backstop to be over the fire. His site is in the woods along the river just outside of town and it's a short walk into the downtown area. Benefit of being around a small town_ but the big downside is complete lack of social services.  I've tried to help him get his shit together but he gets a place for awhile then fucks it up over stupid and petty shit and ends up back in the woods. I tried explaining he can have an apartment *and* still go camping if that's where he really wants to be most of the time. What worries me the most is he's *not* an outdoorsman_ hardly knows anything about bushcraft and refuses to read up on it or even watch YouTube videos to learn. His campsite was set up by another friend who was worried he'd freeze to death a few years ago and that site just sits there unused until he needs it again. If for whatever reason he was run off from that spot he wouldn't be able to build anything similar. I don't want to give up on him even if he seems to have given up on himself. Just can't get through to him and I'm just waiting for the local convenience store manager to text me she hasn't seen him in a few days as an indication something is seriously wrong.,BoneHugsHominy,2,2,3,1530

Of course_ there's no such thing as a free ride_ and all that warm weather culminates into rain beginning Friday_ non stop to midday Sunday. But then again_ that's a week away.

j11gmum,In most states your own insurance covers the damage if the other driver had inadequate or no insurance (its called underinsured and noninsured coverage). Your insurance company will then sue the other driver. It is called subrogation...you are giving your right to sue him to your insurance company. When you call your insurance company_ give them his complete name and address_ any other information they need. Do not contact the guy. Do not go to see him_ even if he invited you. You have insurance agents that represent you and that is their job. You do nothing except report the incident to your insurer_ and take your car to the shop. Ask your insurance company if they will cover a rental vehicle for you. Mine did when my car was in the shop.  Edit: And I'm sorry this happened and you're not having good luck.

Under federalism_ and the right of each state to police itself_ each state can make its own laws with regards to tolerance for illegal immigrants and Asylum Seekers. If an asylum Seeker is not granted immunity_ being returned to their country_ they can still find a way to live in a state that does not Deport them back to their country. Life is not always Fair_ the course may not Grant some people immunity from deportation under the same circumstances.

j0vu2cq,Most of the these you don’t need to test for unless you’re having active symptoms like a fever or sore throat. To be proactive_ you could ask to check on your vaccinations. Shots for flu_ hep_ Covid_ plus all the other usual ones (measles_ etc.) could protect you in the future and maybe help you feel less worried about catching anything.  If you’re older or have particular concerns though_ talk to your doctor about what they recommend. For people in their 40s or older_ chronic diseases (like heart health_ diabetes_ etc.) are more likely to be a concern vs. infectious disease. Checking your blood pressure_ doing a glucose challenge test_ a CBC (complete blood count)_ and a cholesterol test would all be normal things to ask about if you’re above around 40 or have other risk factors.  I’d recommend though_ talking to your doctor about your living situation and ask what they’d recommend for tests or other advice.

After my last bad experience I gave up altogether and started focusing on my self care. It seems I lose all my power and give it to the therapist. Therapy is too expensive and they don't guarantee anything. I would focus on building your coping skills. Therapists never taught me that.

Just remind yourself that you have a place now and it may take awhile but you can rebuild. As far as my past I've spent tons of time just thinking on everything.

They can also be wrapped in Saran wrap and they will reheat again a second time. Not as hard as the first time and not as long. But it does work a second time if you take out all the oxygen and let it sit for a few hours.

j0ryxt0,I was homeless for \~5 years_ might well be homeless again in the future_ and I definitely have mental health issues.  Complex PTSD_ ADHD_ a learning disability_ PMDD_ depression and anxiety.  Plus the total lack of supportive family/friends when shit got real.  I also think the experience of homeless itself_ whether it was the endless series of friends I had to sit through coming up with BS reasons to eject me from their lives_ needing to constantly be on guard to protect yourself_ how people treat you and think of you_ was traumatizing on its own.  I'm a different person after the experience_ and even less functional than I was before it happened.  America's homelessness crisis is as much about a system that deliberately crushes and punishes those who can't be hyper-productive capitalistic tools (i.e. those of us with mental and/or physical disabilities) as it is about soaring housing prices.,SesquipedalianPossum,8,1,3,1530

j0rkqzt,I'm diagnosed bipolar but I'm convinced I have BPD. Being homeless is incredibly difficult with mental health issues. I felt bullied in high-school and a bit after too. I think I'm an easy target for abusive people_ so I just attract that kind of attention. It's definitely hard for me to stay alive too. I think of suicide every day. My parents won't take me in and are emotionally abusive. I don't think they would care all that much or at all if I killed myself. They are narcissists and might pretend to care in order to get sympathy and to seem like decent people. I'm pretty sure it's all an act with them though. On top of having a difficult time being homeless with mental illness_ I'm pretty sure I have long covid and my physical and mental health are worse because of it. I actually feel like I have brain damage. I can't read as much as I used to be able to_ and I can't focus on what I'm reading for as long. It's also making it more difficult communicating with people when I need to buy food or talk to staff at a shelter. Life is hard. I don't see any way out of this for myself. I might eventually buy a tent when I just can't deal with people anymore. I don't think I could actually kill myself.,AdGold4022,5,1,3,1530

j0p9llv,It’s kinda up to you_ either way they will likely end up in the hands of people who need them. Some people might be looking to help a specific group_ such as mothers with children or veterans_ for example. In that case it makes sense to donate to an organization that serves that group. Some people like to pass out their donations personally and see exactly who is benefitting from their gift. Giving directly to individuals is often more rewarding but can also be time consuming.   Where I live I know of at least one organization that goes out and distributes donations to people on the street and in encampments and they allow donors to go out with them to hand out items. Something like that is kind of the best of both worlds. In the end_ there is no right or wrong here. There is plenty of need everywhere so your items will likely be put to good use.,MrsDirtbag,2,1,3,1530
j0p2gky,Not seeing them is common_ I'm in a large city with a large homeless population but you'll rarely see them sleeping on sidewalks or under bridges unless you know where to look.  If you can get it directly to the people in need that's the best_ but not always possible.  I was never on the street_ I always found a place to go wether it was halfway house_ a long term shelter_ a rehab or at the end which was a year and a half ago until  3 weeks from yesterday_ transitional housing.  If you're going to donate to a place I'd avoid the larger institutions and give to the church based and smaller places as in my experience they are better at getting things to those that need them.  The transitional housing I'm in is run through the YMCA and they're assholes_ there are rooms filled with donations that they are hoarding rather than giving them to the people coming in that have nothing other than the clothes on their back. They stick you in a room that has a stove_ but you're lucky if there was a single pan left in the cupboard_ you get a blanket thats supposed to be decorative (the light weight type with all the holes woven into it people normally throw on the back of a chair) 1 plate_ 1 bowl a fork and a spoon and that's it.  I've been in a room that was full of like new pots and pans that were donated that they saving for god knows what_ the Y has money but this place is in the worst repair of any of the places I've stayed_ nothing works and no one cares...  Sorry about the rant_ just pointing out that you have to check out where you donate to.,vtssge1968,2,1,3,1530
j0pxpwr,Rant yes_ but with helpful info for sure. Thanks!  Never heard this particular side of the Y before. I’ve volunteered before with events and such and there are a few in my area…surprisingly_ the one downtown is much nicer than I had ever expected.  During my volunteering time I had noticed some of what you’re describing…there was certainly a bit of stinginess here and there_ but nothing from my perspective (I was assigned to specific areas) so I didn’t see much.  I can say that facilities involving paid memberships were kept up nicely at this location.  It was the management that really creeped me out…they were just…cultish and a bit too judgmental at times.  Yes_ always check out where you donate too!  Thanks for sharing.,missfire23,2,1,3,1530
j0ozygi,Sorry to suggest this_ but would it be easier to support just you and your sis on your own?,doubtingwhale,6,1,3,1530
j0pv3vc,Feeling pained as well_ but I’m echoing this suggestion of just supporting yourself and your sister.  It may not seem feasible now; however_ there’s just so much more that is likely available to you…being young helps in a lot of ways.  Now is the time to look into this if you want to get out of the cycle.  Please look further into it…take the Intel lesson as a guide.  Edit: Took me forever to find it_ but here’s essentially the specific Intel lesson I was referring to.  Direct quote from then CEO Andy Grove_ “People who have no emotional stake in a decision can see what needs to be done sooner.”  This is back when he was able_ with help_ to convince the executives at Intel that it was time to move on from memories and into microprocessing.  Quote from this online article_   https://fs.blog/andy-grove-value-facing-reality/   …”Grove mentions regarding Intel_ you must train yourself to see your situation from the perspective of an outsider.”  I know it’s business_ but feel it’s also helpful when confronting life’s problems.

Nobody visited me but the second I told my family I decided to live out of my car then all at once they cared about my safety. My rent went up $70 more per month. I was like why am I doing this? I was never hardly home anyway. I don't believe someone should stress over money. I'm not going to live and die that way. I thought too about not working a fixed schedule but for now I've worked the same place for over 5 years. It doesn't pay much but I do get about 4 weeks of vacation every year. During the holidays I travel because I don't like being forced to be around my family. It's not that I hate them but I'm a free spirit too and a deep thinker of life. My lifestyle works for me. Sometimes it really makes me happy and other times I wonder why me😂 but then I remember being broke all of the time. I guess you can say I'm on the path less driven.

j0nwhk2,"I was homeless by choice for about half a year. I had become fed up of the pointless 9 to 5 grind and decided to throw it all away and hit the road. In a way it was the best and also worst decision of my life. I roamed around a few states and met a lot of interesting people_ but most of my time was spent just trying to find a place to eat_ sleep_ and sh*t. Being homeless is liberating in many ways_ but 4 walls of your own and a private bathroom really can't be beat in my opinion. Although I'm a man of relatively few needs_ I do prefer to have some small creature comforts.   I also didn't want to live a life in a way that exploited others_ aka working for corporations that exploit or the government_ I still don't. However_ as I was begging for a living or using public resources such as homeless shelters and food banks_ I felt that I was still exploiting the kindness of others_ and even worse I was potentially taking food and space from others who really needed it. I realized you gotta pick your battles in life and compromise on a lot_ but inherently you are only as happy in life with your situation as you wanna be.  In the end I decided to live in the middle path_ I will not pursue meaningless hollow wealth_ but I will live moderately comfortably by putting in the work at a modest job. I'm not happy about the fact that working for corporate interests inevitably harms others_ but I will try to offset that by helping those in need in my community in whatever small way I can. That is pretty much it. The only advice I can give anyone reading this is to stop chasing the unrealistic ideal and try to become content with what you have and what you can do_ even if it isn't what you think you want. Stop trying so hard to exist_ stop overthinking things_ let go and just let yourself be.   ""The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet_ everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves."" -Alan Watts",Sword_King_Ryu,11,1,3,1530

j0okppt,"I'm going to try to make this as short as possible because the full detailed version would end up being way too long.       Lost my job May of 2021 after working there for  nearly a decade_ Had recently moved back in with my mom who is disabled part of her disability being mental illness which was in decline. She's on SSDI and has a HCV/section 8. There's a discrepancy about a rental increase that Landlord requested starting June 1st. Which would increase the portion of rent that my mom was responsible for. This conflicts with  what my mom had previously been told by the housing authority. She attempts to confirm with her case worker at the housing authority and lets the landlord know that her **portion** of the rent would have to be confirmed before she could pay. The Landlord would and did receive the majority of the rent that was subsidized  on the 1st of every month.  My car gets repossessed in June_ but I do manage to get another job. It's for less money but works for me and is easy to get to by bus. We don't hear anything from the case worker until early July. The call does not go well. Case worker is reported. There's a whole back and forth with the case worker regarding paperwork etc... case worker gets everything she needs in order to calculate the corrected rent amount by the end of July.  In the meantime my mom has been keeping the Landlord updated. But with her behavior becoming more erratic the conversations done always go well and she ends up pissing them off.  I'm trying to take over things now.  August comes and the case worker still hasn't given us the amount.  I reach out to her. In the meantime we receive notice of eviction for non payment of rent. A court date is scheduled. BUT_ the federal eviction moratorium that was suppose to end on July 29th 2021 gets extended until October 3rd and prevents Landlords from evicting tenants for non payment of rent only.  So Landlord & Lawyer re file this time accusing my mom of ""extreme uncleanliness"" and being  a ""nuisance"" which is BS.  A new court date is set.  An eviction for someone on section 8 can automatically result in them losing their voucher_ their subsidy.  I start researching and contacting the housing authority etc.. in the midst of all of it and dealing with my mom who cant handle any of this. I get the dates of the hearing mixed up and end up missing it.  Which is an automatic win for the Landlord and we then receive a 10 day notice to vacate.  I reach out to a local legal aid non profit that provides legal services to the poor/low income for help.  I finally receive a response from the case worker who is aware of the eviction and is happy to tell me that eviction results in voucher loss oh and that she has that corrected rent amount for us finally.  I submit some reasonable accommodation requests to try and save my mom's voucher.  I let the case worker know  I contacted legal aid that's when she sends me the info for the emergency rental assistance program.  I get in touch with Legal Aid and she explains our options and works to push through our rental assistance application.  The offer to the Landlord is that if she drops the eviction that she will receive the total past due rent amount and the next three months rent in advance.  Landlord agrees but wants to add that we will agree to move by April 1st_ 2022 and also we have to personally pay the $500 legal fees.  We accept. She gets paid. Eviction gets dropped. Crises adverted...           We are paid up until January 1st 2022.  I start casually looking for apartments for rent in December. I reach out to the housing authority at the beginning of the year and ask if they offer any assistance for tenants searching for section 8 apartments. They send me a list that is  a half page long with listings from 2021 and 2020 that of course_ are no longer available.    The state of Pennsylvania where we live has no source of income law. Source of income laws prevent Landlords from denying rentals to people who are on section 8.  So with the exception of Philadelphia and I believe Pittsburgh who enacted their own source of income laws locally. The rest of the counties in the state have not. Which means refusing to rent to people on section 8_  is a perfectly legal form of discrimination and people are happy to do so.  I started documenting my rental search in February which I did daily. Everything was paid_ everyone was getting along so we ask the Landlord if she could  possibly reconsider the move  out date extending it.  She declined.  I reach out to the case worker ( New case worker) at the housing authority and submit  a reasonable accommodation request for an extended voucher extension.  You see when you have a housing voucher once you move out of a property you are given only a certain amount of time to find a new place to live. I think it's about 60 days normally_ if you can't find somewhere to live within that time frame you lose your voucher. But you can automatically get a month extension_ possible more if you're disabled though reasonable accommodation.  I also sent her a detailed email explaining the issues were having finding somewhere to live and pleading for help.  Only to get a one line response offering no help.  I was contacting rentals every day. I reached out to realtors who have worked with section 8 properties. Nothing.  April 1st comes and we don't know what to expect  we have no where to go.  We end up telling the Landlord and she agrees to another month.    But two weeks later we receive eviction notice_  My mom ends up falling and breaking bones having to go to the hospital. This happens of course the day we're suppose to be in court.  So we miss it_ she gets her judgement.  I email the lawyer from legal aid who helped us before asking her what to do. She tells me that I can file an appeal but that she technically can't help because our case had been closed out and we would have to re apply to open it again.  I didn't have time for that so with just a couple days before the Landlord can legally file the 10 day order to vacate. I have to get to the county court house and file an appeal. I manage to do it in time and get a hearing date for January 2023 and as long as I keep paying rent to the court we can stay in the apartment. So more time right....     No. So despite me making multiple trips to the court house throughout the month of May to make payments. The clerk that filed my paperwork did not explain something about certian sums of money having to be paid by specific dates correctly and me_ someone with no legal experience at all thinking I'm within the dates required to make payments I end up missing a deadline which left me open to the Landlord being able to file to vacate my supersedeas which is what was allowing us to remain on the property until the appeal date. I didn't realize it but the landlord's lawyer sure did and they went right in and filed to vacate it_ once it was we received a ten day order to vacate and on June 9th 2022. The police and landlord came to our apartment where my mother lived for 13 years and gave us 20 minutes to grab whatever we could carry and leave the premises. So me_ my mother who is completely out of her mind at this point and our 14 year old elderly Dog got evicted and were left sitting out front locked out  of our apartment.  As of that day we were homeless.   It continues to get worse and this lasted until October.  But this is already way too long so I'll end it here.",That_Girl_Cray,2,1,3,1530

I was very anxious and even after a year I was convinced that unless things were PERFECT when they came to inspect the place that likely they would take it away from me and I would end up back in the shelter.   I never missed a rent payment. I was pretty much a model tenant but I was still worried I'd be rejected for another Affordable Housing voucher and a new lease. I scrubbed this place for DAYS before the inspection. Nobody does that here. The caseworkers were like ""Calm down. It will be fine!"" but that's how scared I was about renewal and keeping this place.   What you're feeling is natural under the circumstances. It's valid but you have to take a deep breath and risk it anyway.

Maybe [you are the grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper) who doesn't work hard to prepare for the winter.  It isn't the best of Aesop's fables... it isn't the best of any fables.  But there is truth in it.  It does indeed apply to some.  Ok.  You have family.  Could you communicate with them over a distance_ from a warmer climate_ for all the connection they appear to have to you at the moment?  You are going to be homeless in the snow.

j0lvql6,I am going to say this_ given I have worked in customer service (not a call center) and I have a quite a bit of factory work experience.   Through the many factories I have worked at_ very rarely did I find one that was a light factory_ with very little movement and put some type of strain on my body. The only type of factories that I did work at that was light in movement was when I worked at a (placebo) iron making company_ where we just put the iron in a machine and the machine did everything from up_ and we pull the iron from the crane_ band wrap the machine_ and just do a lot of paperwork. Or when I worked at factories where all I did was pick and pack orders and practically just drive a forklift all day.    There have been factory jobs where I have made so much money weekly but had to work 10 hour shifts_ six days a week with double time_ and 1.5 in a half. The money was great and all_ but I had little room to enjoy life. The perks of working in factories is that you could easily make a lot of money_ however do not put all of your bags in one egg. Factory work even if it is easier work can put a strain on your body.   Whenever I worked customer service_ I had more room for work_ but I suffered the most not from customers (for the most part) but from management and they were worse than most management than I experience in the workplace.      Since you do have a physical condition_ I would be cautious of factories to work in.    I would also see if there would be ways to expand any skills you may have or be interested in_ and gain certificates or anything that would generate you more income than entry level positions. Inflation is going up the roof over the past few years_ and many jobs do not cover the expenses of rent let alone_ the rest of the annoying bills we have to pay.   There are going to be narcissist and all types of people who are dysfunctional and try to pull power trips on people_ even if you have worked for the company for a lot of years. No matter what jobs you work at_ they are going to be there. I have NOT YET_ had a job without someone who is just wicked_ vile_ and get their self-worth in how they put others down_ or trying to get brownie points on becoming manager_ when the position is not even open_ or they are underqualified for.   I'm going to just say this and it took me years to understand this. Since these types of people exist and will love abusing others_ and are just straight up bullies. How you react to these individuals in these situations will make a world of a difference to your experience. Remember_ you are there to collect your check_ and do you thing_ and take care of responsibilities. These narcissists and everything else that work at these factories or places are too. How you react to these individuals_ will determine if you find stability in the future or not. Remember_ they will always be around to make our lives miserable.   The path you should choose is not if the job is able to pay your bills alone which is the main reason we work. But to see what you can gain out of the current job you have_ and build on top of that. Doing this will open more doors for you to gain more money later on in life as you continue to gain experience in whatever job you work at.   For example_ let's say I worked at a grocery store and I started from the very bottom. Let's say at this grocery store there are opportunities for me to learn how to drive a forklift_ but I do not have forklift experience. My objective working at this retail store_ is to drive the forklift and become experienced with it_ so I can take my forklift driving skills from a grocery/retail store_ and be able to easily obtain jobs that pays more driving a forklift.,Markie199711,1,1,3,1530

Some ~~homeless~~ people (we don't know if they were homeless) broke in_ trashed a few rooms_ and took the front door off the stove.  I was homeless in Olympia at the time.  He called me_ and asked me to come be homeless at his house_ to watch over it until it sold.  I had use of the garage as a ""room""_ use of the bathroom... I cleaned and filled a couple of trailers full of stuff for the dump_ parked in the back yard... sometimes slept in the house_ sometimes slept in the truck.  And_ he paid me $400 when I was done.  Hiring homeless_ to protect empty property from vandals/thieves.  I still wish I could have turned that into something.  I know it would depend on getting realtors onboard.  Just not how to get them onboard.  EDIT: And again_ to be fair... the numbers in Tacoma have exploded in the past few years_ well beyond what Pierce County was ready to handle.

j0k9l0b,I live in the west coast_ I think Santa Barbara has it better than San Diego. Basically California residents get easy access to food stamps_ just need an ID and proof of income or you tell your case worker you’re unemployed and California will give it to you. When I leaves in Texas_ they were not so kind about giving a “handout” and made me jump through way more hoops to get snap food stamps. cali also offers the best medical care for the poor (in the USA)… but the downside is housing is super expensive here so getting out of homelessness is a struggle. Climate is decent here though_ not too hot and not too cold_ can easily sleep on the beach and have a nice view. Personally I stay out of Los Angeles… i don’t understand why some homeless people go to skid row when Orange County and Santa Barbara are safer_ other then I guess because there are outreaches that go to to skid row each day and kind of offer to help whereas if you’re in OC_ you have to go seek the help yourself. As someone who has experienced homelessness on and off in California because of how expensive housing is and inflation is crazy here_ I am curious 👀 to if the grass is greener on the other side like maybe Oregon_ Washington….

j0l7lbr,"A lot of long-term homeless in WA & OR and I'm told we have phenomenal programs to assist the homeless. The states do require a TON of hoops to jump through and a lot of the housing up here isn't affordable because longtime Californian's sell their homes for cash and pay for real estate in WA & OR in full with the proceeds of selling in California.   The weather also sucks up here to be homeless depending on where you end up. The average rainfall is roughly nine months in the greater Portland Metro and SW Washington areas. A quick Google search nets Seattle receiving around eight months of rain and Seattle's cost of living is probably one of the highest in the nation_ but_ they DO have good programs for the homeless so it's a tradeoff. Portland also has good programs but again_ cost of living and the challenges to get out of being homeless.  I've met folks who have been addicts and homeless here in SW Washington who have gone from sleeping on the streets_ into a shelter_ gotten into recovery_ and now work for a state sub-contractor with their own place to call home.

j0j7dh1,I have survived up to negative 10° below zero in my van. Basically I had a sleeping bag with two fleece blankets and a large heavy duty comforter. I also found a California king size comforter that I stretched around the van like a tent and I started my van every 4 to 5 hours to keep warm but for the most part even when I fell into a deep sleep I was okay. The key is to maintain your warmth.   For those of us that don't have vehicles I've seen people successfully use water resistant sleeping bags and put the comforter inside with them it looks puffy and uncomfortable but it does the job. Mind you you have to wear some clothing as well I had a hoodie cotton pants and socks as long as with the beanie.    Thrift shops are your friend it saved my behind so many times.,johnfro5829,7,1,3,1530

They're finding more bodies everyday. Stay safe everyone_ if you need it_ find a warming center. If you're sleeping on the ground_ lay down at least 4 layers of cardboard to keep the ground from sapping your heat_ and please remember to eat plenty.

j0kb49u,While it can't be promised_ chances are these are empty threats. It sounds like someone stupid got fucked over and now you're being threatened because you appear to be an easy target (could be just because you're a woman by yourself - i think - while dude missing money is a man).   Usually when people are serious about messing you up over money_ it's not going to be this small of an amount_ it's not going to be food stamps_ and you aren't going to get this many threats. Generally people who are serious will maybe tell you once or twice if they think you'll cough up money_ but after that_ you're getting got. It seems like they know you don't have the money in cash_ so they just want the food stamps. Very few people are going to be willing to commit the crime of severely injuring you over some food stamps. Nobody wants to go to prison for that.   I could be reading the situation completely wrong_ but I don't think you need to be TOO worried about these people. Take precautions_ you know_ don't let them catch you alone and corner you_ maybe some pepper spray is a good idea.  I can't make promises_ like I said_ but I think this is going to amount to a lesson learned about trusting new sketchy strangers for you and not much more.,Suckmyflats,3,1,8,1024
j0iiot7,Hate to say it - you're screwed either way. If you admit what you've done_ it's a crime and you're going to lose benefits now and for the future. If you don't admit what you did_ then you should leave town for your own safety.,Antique_Radish8823,11,1,3,1530

j0iyxmz,I wouldn't even say selling your stamps was the wrong decision here. I mean sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive.  Where you went wrong was was trusting this guy to handle it for you. Now you're the one who got fucked over.  The only thing you can really do is wait for the replacement card and pay the people who are owed and watch who you trust.    Good luck.,That_Girl_Cray,4,1,3,1530
j0kgxml,You look like a mark. You are on the streets_ this aint a game. Dude did not take off_ he is still around. You are still around_ people are lying. If they murder you over food_ they were gonna murder you anyhow. If they did not hand the money to you_ they know it's not your fault. I doubt they even handed him any money. Stop being weak. Tell them to fuck themselves. If they were serious_ they would have already fucked you up. They are just vultures looking for scraps. You are living the fucking life_ there is no way out. You must rise up and defeat all of your fears of you ever want to stop being homeless. They are bullying you_ and paying them or giving them your food sure as hell is not going to make it go away_ in fact_ if you don't hold your ground_ they will do this for a longer period of time. Once they see you as a food or money source_ they will keep coming back. It is far_ far more dangerous to give them anything_ than to be hard now. Time to realize life ain't a game. Man the fuck up_ and do your best. But Do Not under any circumstances give them anything easily just because you think it's easier or safer. I personally like to remind people in your position_ that no matter how tough someone is_ their neck is still soft_ and if attacked_ it will be self defense. Keep that in mind.,1IsNeverEnough4Me,2,1,3,1530

j0fdll7,That’s a thoughtful gift for them. I think many would take that gift in a heartbeat.,Ilikesilverandspam,2,1,8,1024
j0lp5na,People would love it.  It just wouldn't do the job everyone thinks.  There is a fundamental difference many people can't see.  Homed individuals go out into the cold where a hand warmer would be useful... and then go back inside to actually get warm when their time outside is finished.  That is the target customer base for an item like that.  A similar item would be the heated cushions you can bring to sporting events.  A portable_ heated pad like that sounds like it would be a great idea for someone who spends a lot of time in the cold.  That fundamental difference is... spending a lot of time in the cold_ versus spending virtually ALL of one's time in the cold.  If one's default location is a cold one_ where there is no finding of a warm place to spend hours... the problem becomes one of heating the chest_ not the hands.  Warm hands feels nice... sure.  Feet need warmth too.  And noses_ and ears_ etc.  A box of disposable one-time use handwarmers are better for THIS kind of situation_ only because you can use multiple packs at a time_ in different locations simultaneously.. one in each shoe_ one for each hand_ maybe a couple in some shirt pockets... maybe a pair at your lower back if you are sitting or laying down.  Then_ you've got heat at those extremities and body points for 6-10 hours at a time.  The down side_ is how many of those packs you go through at one time.  Someone relatively recently posted about a heated vest that they saw on sale_ from a company that makes expensive heated clothing.  The placement of the heating elements in the pants and jackets were great... the expected battery life was obviously only meant for recreational use of a couple of hours at a time before needing to be recharged.  Like.. Ski Clothing_ version 2.0.  Same kind of stuff would be great for the homeless in the cold_ if the battery life lasted 4 to 6 times longer.  And if the gear used replaceable batteries.  Using custom soft Li-On packs means when they no longer hold a charge_ you throw the clothes away.  Sure_ soft Li-On packs can be any shape the manufacturer needs_ while staying slim.. think the batteries in phones and tablets.  It just doesn't do a homeless person any good when the $300-$600 electric outfit they wear for the winter_ only lasts for that one winter at most.  Again.  People will love getting them.  They will be grateful.  Just remember.... when you've been cold for 14-18 hours_ and you are trying to sleep for the night to make it to the morning where you can get warm for a while_ only having that one rectangle of heat might end up being more frustrating than comforting.  When it has been a while_ and there's still more cold ahead_ you can't seem to find the right place to put the handwarmer and you spend more time awake moving it around than you do sleeping with it in the right spot... because there isn't one right spot.  If they aren't too expensive... maybe give them out in pairs (one for each armpit_ or one for the chest and one between the thighs)?  Maybe include a few $3 Emergency Thermal Blankets (from the camping section in Walmart) as well?,bongart,2,1,8,1024

Add some crackers_ a few packs of Mayo_  and a few slices of high protein bread like wholegrain.  And you get a protein count up to 28 grams a sandwich.  I wouldn't worry about coolers or anything that isn't disposable.

j0gck6a,"There are a few factors that may ""trap"" people into homelessness_ one is purely biological_ like sleeping/eating little or bad_ ""looking homeless"" as in wardrobe and perhaps some hair management_ chronic illness and ""job market mismatch""_ you might be too brown for a job_ or too uneducated_ or overqualified etc. There's no cure for some of that_ but for the rest a good shelter should be all one needs. Let's not forget that after all the great and not so great wars_ including Ukraine_ we're all coming out of the shelters!

j0axfwv,You aren't going to die unless you give up. Millions of homeless people are alive and well right now to one degree or another.  What do you do? Prioritize staying alive. I assume here that you have no dollars to your name...  #### WATER:  Get water. Even if you gotta stick your face in the bathroom sink and drink. Drink till you're full-- and find a container to fill. Check all the trash cans for empty bottles with screw-on tops. Trashy and dirty_ yes. But you need to be able to carry water somehow to avoid future dehydration.  #### SLEEP.  2.1. Is it above freezing outside??? If so...  You need to crash for a few hours. Don't go to a bus stop or anywhere where people would regularly walk by at night. Find a dark corner somewhere. Under a tree_ or in some bushes_ or with your back to a chain-link fence. If you can scrounge up some cardboard and/or a blanket_ that'll make things way more comfortable. Cover yourself with what you've got_ and get something under you too for insulation. Cardboard sheets are magic.  2.2 Is it freezing temps outside?  Stay inside. If this wallmart has a subway/starbucks or whatever attached_ sit around there until day time. If there isn't anything like that_ you could probably lay out in a bathroom stall... either of these options are likely to lead to an encounter with employees_ possibly followed by an encounter with a cop. Be polite_ be honest-- explain your situation and ask those employees and/or the Officer for help.  #### Your near future...  Keep calling those shelters. Carry water. Keep your device charged. Figure out what you need to sleep comfortably: tent? Blankets? Giant puffy coat? Do you prefer darkness and bushes? Maybe a well-lit doorway with a camera? Sometimes people are less likely to start shit if you point out that they're being filmed. Figure out how to get food_ one way or another.

j0azm4o,Then go somewhere better. Use your feet if you have to but get to a better place with better resources for the homeless. It might just save your life if you do. I've been where you are and it took me half a decade to get out but it is possible.   Nothing worked for me till I got into the system and started working it from within. As horrible as shelters are they're the first stepping stone for a lot of homeless people towards a better life.   It is brutally hard the life you are living now but if you can't find help where you are then the best thing you can do is get yourself to someplace better to work from. You CAN survive this but you have to learn to think outside the box and to be your own best advocate.   Coming back to NYC probably saved my life. If I had become homeless where I used to live I'd have been in pretty much the same situation. No real resources and a horrible climate most of the year besides that probably would have literally killed me given my health issues.   NYC has a pretty horrible shelter system and the social workers and that they are slow to provide real help. It was supremely discouraging and frustrating at times. But it got me healthcare. The system supported me till I got disability and it got me housed again.   For that I am truly grateful and you will never hear me dissing NYC because of that. I am literally alive today because NYC had the resources available for me to get help and get out. None of it would ever have happened where I used to live. I'd have likely died of neglect_ depression_ and chronic illness long before now.   Instead I'm living in a tiny studio in Manhattan and doing mostly okay and counting my blessings not my hardships.   You have to get to someplace where you can get real help. That's the first big step for you towards getting out. You can do it.  This is but a season in your life and it's a bad one but eventually it will pass. It doesn't have to be the end unless you let it be.   Been there_ done that_ and believe me I know. There were lots of days where I thought I couldn't endure one more minute of the constant indignities and the fight for survival. I just wanted to lay down my head and die_ but then I almost did and it led me into the system and that ironically saved my life and led to a better one.   There are other places where you might do better. Find one and get there. Go into the system_ work it and get out. It won't be easy but you can do it.   🤗🤗🤗,mtempissmith,12,1,9,1231
j0asy7q,Is there a Traveller’s Aid Society office in your city?  What they have done in the past_ of course with information that you provide them_ is contact a “family” member in a different city and they will purchase or offer a discounted bus (Greyhound) ticket to travel to a different city_ so you can “reunite” with your family.  They will verify your “relative”. and how you are “related” to them and how your “relative” will “support” you in a a different community.  I only suggest a change of location because maybe there will be more possible opportunities and a better environment for you to succeed/survive compared to the community you currently are living in.  Stay safe and watch your back_ especially when resting/sleeping.  You may want to scout out a more remote/isolated place before you try to rest/sleep.

j0ccsr8,">Anyone ever been to this point _ what do I do?  You are in a sub populated with people who have also hit their own respective rock bottoms.  Some_ more than once.  Imagine if you hit rock bottom.... and climb back up only to later_ find you can hit it again at different depths.  What do you do?  There is a ton of great advice out there_ and you've already gotten some of it.  All the advice you are going to get_ however... the advice that is useful... is all going to be local to \*YOU\*.  People can suggest sleeping behind dumpsters_ or in bushes_or under a bridge.... but none of that matters if you can't find any dumpsters_ there are no bushes or hedges that you know of_ and your area has no bridges you can remember.  You are the one who now has to become really familiar with the area you are homeless in.  That means exploration.  That means reconnaissance.  It means getting off the sidewalk and behind buildings_ or in the tall grass_ or in a copse of wood.    It means looking at Google maps.  Where trains and roads meet_ sometimes there is a bridge.  Highways have overpasses and elevated on/off ramps.  You can even use Google to let you virtually walk down streets and roads_ to get an idea of where buildings with cover \*might\* be.... before you actually walk down those streets.  It is \*ALMOST\* like using Google as your own personal drone_ to do most of your scouting for you.  You can use that view to find sections of forest that look dense and are not close to businesses and residences.  >I have called every shelter there is... Nothing is available right now.  You mean... you've called every shelter there is_ ***and you've put yourself on their waiting lists***_ but none have any space at the moment... right?  You \*DID\* put yourself on their waiting lists?  Why is that important?  Well... first_ if_ say_ there are three shelters in the area_ and they all have waiting lists_ it is extraordinarily likely that the names on **each** list will almost be the same for **all** three lists.  People who sign up_ will sign up with all of them_ so they can get into the first one out of all of them_ that has the space.  Second... people won't always respond when it is their turn_ especially if the list is long and they already found their own solution while they waited.  So getting on a long list doesn't necessarily always mean a long wait.  When a bed opens up_ they can cut through half a dozen names on their list looking for the next person who wants it.  You have fallen off a cliff.  Up there_ was stability.  Up there_ was the life track everyone else seems to be on.  Tunnel vision in your desire and want to get BACK to what you had_ makes you think you are in a hole.  But you aren't.  You didn't fall into a hole.  You fell off a cliff.  That means you can stop looking up asking ""How do I climb back up this impossible wall?""... and you can look to your left_ your right_ and behind you instead.  And in this case_ I'm not just speaking metaphorically.  You really have to start walking around_ looking into places you've never really looked before.  You have to take stock of your surroundings.  Are you in the USA?  Are you aware of what SNAP food stamp benefits are?  Do you know that you can likely sign up for them_ online?  If you wonder about things like... how you have no address... you can use things like General Delivery to your closest post office and be honest that you HAVE no street address.  Some online portals actually take the homeless into account_ and will accept the nearest intersection as a street address.  But... that is a specific things to look into_ it is well detailed in many posted locations on being something you need to do_ and it will take time to get them.  What do you do for food now?  There are soup kitchens_ food banks_ churches to hit up_ dumpsters to dive_ fast food Chicken places to hit up right after closing (they make food they have to toss at the end of the night more than other fast food places).  Finding these places is going to burn shoe leather_ and require exploration.  >Is death the only other option?  Obviously not_ since **Exploration of your area is an option**_ as I just detailed.  Another option is to LEAVE your area for one with better/more resources.  You have two feet... and if you can't sleep_ you can trudge.  Where do you go?  When you search Google for local homeless shelters_ what happens when you expand the map to include other towns?  What happens when you search specifically for homeless shelters in those towns?    Sometimes_ you might even find luck in smaller towns with only one or two shelters.  I know I did with Jacksonville NC for a while_ once upon a time.... small town_ one shelter_ half-full.  And that doesn't mean trudging to a new town and THEN seeing what is there... it means online searches_ phone calls_ and THEN trudging to a new place with more and/or better opportunities.  >I was forced to sleep at the bus stop again  Who forced you to sleep there?  Did they use a weapon when they threatened you?  If you want to say that circumstance forced you to sleep there... then you aren't taking responsibility for your CHOICE to sleep there.  You could have chosen to look around for a more secluded place to sleep_ but you didn't.  That is not circumstance forcing you to sleep in that spot... it was a choice you justified before you closed your eyes.  You slept at a bus stop before_ so you must have some sense from your experience_ that this is a safe place to sleep.  That is a MISTAKE to assume_ and you have now been reminded of that fact.  You are not going to get ANYWHERE_ if you don't learn from your mistakes.  You are not going to LEARN from your mistakes_ if you don't acknowledge making them.  You chose to sleep on that bench.  Own that.  If you want to walk into a wooded area_ bend a bunch of saplings together_ and tie it into a bunch... while they are still in the ground... and then cover the outside with underbrush... you can make yourself a hut.  Not a great one... but that's from the crap on the ground around you in the woods.  You can make a lean-to out of that stuff on the ground.  If you explore_ you might find sections of tarp_ pieces of linoleum countertop that peeled away from what it was attached to_ plywood... all kinds of things that you could use to build that shelter.  But even if you didn't explore and find that stuff_ if the forest is big enough_ everything will already be there to be able to construct some kind of shelter from the elements.  It isn't rocket science.  Our ancestors did this for eons... tens_ if not hundreds_ of thousands of years.  If you are on the list for shelter space_ you are only killing time until you get in.  What do you do?  You take it one day at a time.  You deal with today.  Need a goal?  Find a Salvation Army Administrative office.  They will load you up with supplies/clothes/gear.  Might even have a shelter they can ***transport*** you to.... possibly even local cash assistance.  If it is a long walk to get to it.... well_ that's the work you do in exchange for the help you get out of it.",bongart,7,1,8,1024

j0eze2o,I just wanted to piggyback on this reply to agree with keeping to yourself. You need all your energy to concentrate on getting yourself through this and while throwing in with a bunch of other homeless people seems like a logical step_ it rarely works out. There is too much drama and theft and backstabbing. In my opinion it's much better to be alone and just always quietly aware of your surroundings.   Also_ always be looking for a better spot. Keep it moving. You learn as you go and get smarter every day.  Keep your chin up. It gets better. 🤗,SmellOk6406,3,2,3,1530

j0crx41,I live in San Jose_ CA and we’re somewhat unique compared to other large cities in that our airport is basically adjacent to our downtown. When I was homeless I would go there to charge sometimes. The easily accessible public restrooms are nice too_ plus you can return luggage carts for quarters_ although the cart jockeys will try to get to them first. The great thing about hanging out at the airport is that someone who looks a little tired_ a little disheveled_ with a bunch of stuff plugged in doesn’t look out of place. Even though you can’t go through security without a boarding pass a lot of people who arrive very early for a flight (or if there is a long delay) don’t pass through security until closer to their departure time_ so it’s not strange to be there.   For best results you shouldn’t stay in the same location for more than an hour or two. I wouldn’t want to *sleep* there personally_ but that’s just me.,MrsDirtbag,5,1,3,1530

j0dci3n,It's kind of hard to stay at airports for long periods of time. When I was the sheriff's deputy back in the day we would notice people who were lurking too long. There's also a certain security features at airports where at the same person keeps popping up you're going to be questioned it's also public info that the majority of airports have facial recognition cameras.  Both plain clothes and regular security. that's not to mention that depending on the lay out of the airport it might not be any place for you to stay since you'll have to go past security.    However_ that's not to say when I was homeless and I stayed in the airport most of the security folks after they got to know me left me alone as long as I stayed out the way and kept myself reasonably clean. Now from the time I was a sheriff deputy usually after a while we ignore the homeless folks that we know and identified. We usually give them hints when it's time to move along.,johnfro5829,4,1,3,1530
j0e24e3,"Not really_ There's no point playing hide and seek in a modern airport with hundreds of cameras and staff. From my own experience as a traveller and occasional ""resident"" I'd say there's hardly any legal basis in most parts of the world to remove you from the open parts of an airport. Bona fide travellers may stay in airports two or three days anyway because of flight cancellations and such_ and I don't think anyone's counting_ though it will become obvious to some staff you're becoming a resident. They'll typically question you_ both as a formality and out of boredom. But they won't be able to kick you out on some pretext like bad hygiene without risking having to prove later on that they applied the same standards to other passengers.  So_ just to be clear_ you can stay at airports for a VERY long time.

j0c6nio,seems like an airport would be kind of tough....from my pespective the airport has two areas of where people wait.

Unlike behind the counter(boarding pass area)...people on the outside re rarely there for any real length of time. Thus raising attention sooner.

j09s5xn,Also homeless in Colorado here. It can get really nasty out there on cold nights. And the weather is going to be pretty damn cold for a while. So if you can gear up_ now it's the time.  I have had good luck keeping warm with the following items:  • A sleeping pad to cover the ground. This is essential_ as if you lay directly on the ground without inadequate layer to protect you_ all your heat will drain away through the ground. Incidentally_ if you're anywhere near Glendale_ I have a spare sleeping pad and a half that need a good home_ as I just upgraded mine. In the past_ I have gotten away with it simply using layers of cardboard.  • A good sleeping bag. Something rated below 32°F/0°C.  • A good thick blanket to go over the sleeping bag. A local activist gave me a heavy comforter — but any kind of thick or insulated blanket will do.  • A tent_ tarp_ or other windbreak that's also resistant to rain and moisture.  The problem with all of this right now_ however_ are the sweeps that they've ramped up. This makes it virtually impossible to set up any kind of structure to shelter under_ except in some of the larger camps downtown_ which are supposed to have a week's notice before a sweep.  Finding a sheltered area_ such as under a bridge_ is advised_ except it's also an obvious place where they are likely to check. There are some bridges that are more secluded_ where you could hide up in underneath and not be obvious. Might not even need a tent under there.,thelink225,7,1,3,1530

j0arc5r,I don’t know your budget_ but do you have any family_ friends_ acquaintances that would let you stay with them this winter in Florida or any of the states that border Florida?  I don’t want to alarm you_ but depending on where you are in Colorado and how cold it becomes outside_ you or anyone else that is outside has a larger risk of dying due to hypothermia and/or cold exposure.  With that said_ I actually spoke to a man the morning after he slept outside in 18 degree F (probably lower with the wind chill) in Colorado.  The man told me he slept in an alley with at-least five or six blankets on top of and around him.  I don’t know how many more nights he survived outside_ but I wouldn’t do it.  I remember one year reading in news from the large cities in Colorado that almost sixty people without homes died throughout one twelve month period in just one of the large Colorado cities.,Fair-Background-8680,2,1,3,1530
j0ckvyw,Everyone leaves come January.  The snow storms show up and the shelters fill up.  You're doing the right thing.  If you don't have the right gear by now_ it's best to just leave.  This late into winter you would at least need a tent_ 0 degree bag_ sleeping pad_ thermals_ boots_ etc just to not freeze to death.  And you're still gonna be cold.  Pro tip:  Go down to the sandwich line at Auraria Campus at 11am.  After they finish feeding_ they open up their clothing room.  They have the best clothing room in the city.  And for some weird reason they have a lot of sleeping pads.  I don't think homeless people know what they are because no one ever takes them.

j01aqw2,There were a lot of people who treated me like crap when I was homeless but there were also a few people I considered  everyday angels. You have to focus on the good people_ not the bad. It's a hard mindset to leave behind_ feeling like human trash. Even when you stop being homeless it stays with you for a long while.   I don't think I will ever leave being homeless behind. It caused some fundamental changes in my character_ some good_ some bad. I don't trust people like I used to and I'm not nearly as kind. I'm far more cynical when it comes to people and their motives that's for sure but I do make an effort not to be too suspicious or nasty and I try not to just assume the worst of people.   I think for me it was a bit different than for some other people. In my life I've always had to deal with people trying to bully me_ trying to make me feel bad about myself. Being homeless multiplied that by 100x but since I'd previously experienced it I was able to seperate that bullying from my sense of self.   Being able to do that probably helped me a lot in terms of being able to be stable mentally. I'm not a docile person. I don't sit there and take it when people abuse me. I can't so needless to say that made me very unpopular at times in the shelters where staff and residents both like to do just that.   Being homeless could have turned me into a very angry_ horrible person but I simply refused to let that happen. It's a choice. You can either let being homeless beat you up emotionally and define you or you can choose to defy it_ get busy_ and get yourself out.   Someone I met early in the experience told me that being homeless was a seaon in my life. That it might seem hopeless but that eventually it would be over and real life would begin anew. It was the longest season of my life but in the end I did pass through it and I made it out to a real home and a better life.   You can too but in order to do it you have to own your own life and control how you respond to the abuse. Let the negativity  eat you up emotionally you won't make it out. Defy it and you will.   Never mind what negative people think.   You do for you and you believe in yourself and you'll be far more likely to make it.,mtempissmith,61,1,9,1231

j04orey,I focused on being someone I like.  I'm angry at the world for a number of things... and I'd still be angry if I wasn't homeless.  I'm here.  I'm harsh and opinionated_ but I try to do what I can_ one person at a time.    I don't ask for help_ and I don't get disappointed at the lack of it.    I learned to give people leeway before they earn trust.... play out the rope a bit more before I commit to anything.  I learned to ask questions_ to determine if kindness is genuine_ or hides ulterior motives... basically I learned to insert a buffer of time between me and anything that requires trust_ to give me the time to determine if trust is warranted.  I had to learn that... I'm still learning that.  I've learned that whether or not I want to trust_ has nothing to do with it_ and can actually only cause problems.  I dunno.  Maybe the new caution is a good thing... keep you off the path of homelessness.  Maybe you find a way to help some of the others still on the streets.  I know that today in the USA_ being a trusting individual will only lead to trouble.,bongart,4,1,8,1024

j007cun,Hi_ I work at a homeless shelter so I can maybe help a bit. First of all_ thank you for offering to help your friend ❤ Some of the items you've mentioned probably wouldn't be allowed to be brought into a shelter - outside pillows and blankets are a bedbug risk_ a space heater could be a potential fire hazard_ cleaning supplies are provided at the shelter. Some shelters also limit or entirely ban outside food_ drink_ or toiletries because guests can use them to sneak in drugs or alcohol - it sucks but it is what it is.   Some material things that our guests really appreciate are good quality_ sturdy backpacks and shoes_ comfortable pajamas_ slide on slippers/shower shoes_ and always nice hoodies - I swear I get hit up for hoodies at least 5 times a day. Ear buds to block out the noise from others are also super popular.   For her kiddo_ how old is he? Look at maybe gifting experiences for her to do with her son that she otherwise might not be able to afford - family shelters usually have tons of toys available. Is there a local trampoline park in her area that they could go to on a rainy day? Indoor pool_ Chuck e Cheese_ Dave and Busters_ a local zoo or amusement park? Something like that would make an amazing gift and wonderful memory for both of them!  Again thank you for supporting your friend - I'm sure just knowing that she has you is a gift in and of itself ❤,wifeatron3000,46,1,8,1024

j03baqz,Piggy backing on this as a shelter associate as well_ this is the best and most comprehensive answer. There are so many things that are not allowed to be brought in. (Pepper spray being one of them) She may find that she needs things as they come up but the less she has in a shelter_ the better. Theft is rampant and the shelter is not liable.   Outlets are limited and mostly reserved for those who require oxygen or use scooter chairs. Think_ a weighted blanket as opposed to a heated blanket.   Things I'm asked for the most: shower shoes_ ear plugs_ hand warmers_ socks_ razors_ bus passes.   Things I see people need the most: headphones_ slippers_ portable chargers_ a bag or suitcase that locks.   I am a huge advocate of gifting experiences and can't recommend it enough. Being in a shelter is mentally exhausting for both residents and staff alike so anything that gets them out of the shelter will help.,Cool_Jackfruit_4466,3,1,3,1530

j0jzjc2,Right_ which means diddly to most people who need help_ because AZ is quick to identify people w mental and cognitive disabilities and put them on SS_ which automatically helps prevent homelessness for them and their immediate family members.

izyk1s8,Feel free to reach out with any questions you might have. I will do my best to point you in positive directions.   Thank you for looking into open data.  Edit: as others have said_ though_ it sometimes helps to look at the more data oriented places first. There are RRH programs all over the US. Some have restrictions_ some serve specific populations_ women/children/vets first.   To get a scope_ the number of programs is in the multiple thousands. Asking for a personal survey of places can actually bring inordinate attention to them.   The intention is noble_ but the methods need refinement =) you might have good luck on a larger undertaking asking social science subs for open data resources.   https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/coc-housing-inventory-count-reports/,cruelmalice,2,2,3,1530
izy3kn3,In Tucson Arizona there is the Primavera Foundation.

Or_ call any town/county mission yes homeless mission for the information. In California it’s called 2-1-1 information to get the info.      If your non profit doesn’t know how are homeless people supposed to know? Aren’t you the ones who should have and give this information out?

izy4d3z,Six days ago a user on this sub posted a question asking information about being homeless_ and pregnant. There was a user in that thread that stated she gone through the experience of being homeless_ and pregnant recently_ and is now working at a homeless shelter. You may want to ask that user for advice.   Besides living in Florida… Your friend might be experiencing difficulties finding resources based on the lactation she’s in. Hurricane Ian was a doozy_ and was immediately followed by hurricane Nicole. The areas “ in or around the Villages” is most likely overwhelmed with people who have home damage_ or lost their homes completely.   Selling her car is a massive risk. If she plans on using the proceeds for housing the money will run out quick_ and may make it difficult to get to work depending on her location. This is obvious_ but I needed to mention it.     If she_ and the other homeless mother can “commit” to working together it could be a working solution. Providing child care for one another_ working opposite shifts… but again I would warn your friend against using the capital from the sale of her car to fund this idea.   Sometimes religious organizations can be helpful_ she could call churches in her surrounding area_ and ask for help. When she speaks to them I would limit the details given to them. With two little ones she’s in a precarious situation. She could also call Goodwill_ and the Salvation Army. Because of the storms these organizations may have been given some special funding.,oliphantPanama,1,1,8,1024

izvxjwe,Welcome to the sub and welcome to the Bay area (I’m in the Bay as well_ San Jose) I’m very sorry that you are in a difficult situation. I just want to remind you that this sub is **not** a place to ask for or offer assistance in the form of money_ donations_ free stuff_ etc. There are many other subs that are set up for that sort of thing_ we list some of them in our sidebar.   Most of our members are currently or formerly homeless people. This sub is a place where we can share experiences_ advice_ and information. It’s a (relatively) judgment free space where we can talk about issues that effect homeless people.   So for example_ maybe you want some tips from others who have lived in a vehicle with a pet. Maybe you’d like some ideas on where to look for certain types of resources. Maybe you would like to hear about possible places to park from other people in the Bay area. Those are all *exactly* the type of thing this sub is for.   Again welcome to the sub_ feel free to message if you have any questions about the rules.,MrsDirtbag,6,1,3,1530
j02uksi,There is a website for homeless and their pets. They are in Nevada but help all over U.S. just remember time difference if you call. They have a database on their website if you put in a city or zipcode it will tell you where to get free pet food. They also have free vet care and helped pay for my feral to get an operation. They paid half and friends on twitter paid the other half. They pay all of it I just didnt want all their money spent on us. For vet care you have to call them. They also have free crates. Dont know how you get them but again you have to call. They have resources on their website and also if you call them as all they deal with is homeless people and animals and probably vets to help people. They paid over the phone with a credit card so you just need a vet who will take it near you_ but always call first. They are open M-F 9-3pm and remember are in Nevada.

izvatfr,I work at a homeless shelter and most of our guests are clothed almost exclusively from our donation room. We are constantly in need of warm clothing here in Wisconsin. Find a women's shelter close to you and donate directly ❤️,wifeatron3000,13,1,8,1024
izuxuai,Dropping off in front of a tent is probably not the best idea because you can't guarantee the person in the tent will be able to use what you're passing on. Alternatively_ you can initiate conversation with folks and ask if they could benefit from what you have to offer.  You can try a shelter local to you_ but please be aware they may not be able to accept your donation either.   The facility I work for is small and only 5% of the people receiving our services opt to utilize our clothing closet. There's a much larger facility local to us_ but they don't accept used clothing_ only new items. Be prepared and know YMMV.,Hot_Computer8067,11,1,8,1024
iztx4bh,Just Google local homeless shelters.  Also don't donate stuff to Goodwill if you want it to go to the homeless. They sell donated goods to fund job growth programs they run.  If you're close to San Antonio_ TX_ you can go directly to Haven for Hope which literally is the finest homeless rehabilitation facility on the planet. They have a donations depot where you can donate literally anything.  I attended that facility about two years ago. After I got housing_ Haven for Hope paid for my first two months of rent/utilities and furnished my whole apartment and gave me a bunch of clothes and a pair of shoes and work boots. A+ but hopefully I don't have to go again.,knoegel,6,1,9,1231
izvv0l9,Since people have suggested similar_ but not this exact thing.  Go across the city_ grab some throwaway hangers.  Post them up like you would a sign on a telephone pole_ ask politely people take what they need and can wear in maybe a sign.  This is absolutely the most effective way_ as long as they're not expensive no homeless person is going to pass it up.  Although this may be rougher on rainy days_ you may have to ask to put them on bulletin boards.  You'd be surprised how many places would not turn that down.  A bar I worked at when I was young would have NO issue doing this (I seen a coat up there once or twice).  If they're very specific_ or people you want to help_ you should only take them to appropriate 3rd parties.  I may be a member of TST_ but I won't deny when a church does well_ bring them to a church.  They'll be handled by a human with decency.  On the flip side_ this makes it difficult for the homeless who need it but don't get around so easy.  Thus my suggestion of posting them on poles_ then everyone will see them.  Car dwellers_ tents_ rough sleepers_ couch surfers_ or even those that are on the brink of homelessness.  They'll appreciate it as well.,Sickologyy,2,1,9,1231

izru093,"Awesome sauce! Good job on working your butt off to be able to get given a chance. What anyone that's never been homeless before don't realize is that SO MANY of us(& the % gets higher and higher every week) of reg people literally being a bad day away from ending up there themselves. And that these are the same people that ""think it's SO EASY_and there's ""SO MUCH HELP"" /s that if you DONT want to be homeless/on drugs/need mental health access is that all ya gotta do is snap your fingers and help rains down on you....that is THE FARTHEST thing from the truth!  And also the fact MOST homeless(it's just A SMALL VISABLE minority of folks that ""choose"" to be there or have been homeless and mentally ill with no help for so long they essentially become ""institutionalized"" like being in jail too late ng and DONT know HOW to live indoors and pay bills and stuff like that.) Are also the ones causing MOST of the problems that help ""normal"" people look down on domestically challenged folks all as useless_undeserving _thieving_drugged up_lying_lazy_ subpar(or not even) HUMAN.(NEVER understood THAT ONE) Or if there's no addiction/mental support health than SO MANY slip through the cracks..and the ""visible"" ones(not the people in their cars_families in RVs_working sober people living in tents_squats_couch surfing_etc) are the ones Not causing problems_but also do not receive much help. Others also forget that most ""free meals""/food banks are usually during working hrs so A LOT of people go hungry(or have to beg for food/$$ to get to work) AFTER working their new shifts waiting 2-3 wks for their first paycheque(I've dealt with that a few times)and the ONLY way I ever got off the streets was due to receiving help and chances from good people that were willing to take a chance on me.   And at least until you can find yourself a place_you can also afford to keep enough gas in your car to at least run it more and keep you 2 warmer throughout the night. Do you get to bring your animal to work? Chilling behind the counter or something? Of the support animal doesn't work_mention to them he/she can just be an added bonus of ""security"" or a cute pup to pet to maybe lure in more customers ;) or at least if they are in your car_ you can visit them during breaks.

izx9pg2,I have a friend whose parents died when she was in high school.  She became homeless.  She got a job at a gas station.  She showed up on time_ worked hard and studied when it was slow.  She got to know the owner of the gas station.  He told her he would loan her the money for a car if she stayed in school.  She ended up getting a degree in computers and is a multimillionaire now.

I usually wrap it up around 1am_ then hit the gym for some cardio and a shower. After that it's time to find a place to park_ usually around 2 am. I then set up my backseat_ and hit the hay.   Once a week or so I do laundry. Normally I find a dumpster in the apartment complexes I deliver to_ to dump my trash 2-3 times a week. I'm an avid reader_ so I visit the library 1-2 a week.  Right now I'm looking for a job_ because the apps are inconsistent_ and don't pay very well. I'm breaking even before maintenance/taxes.,Here4HotS,7,1,3,1530

izmvs9r,Not sure where you’re at but the first thing I would do is contact banks and any form of ID you have- report them as stolen. Then_ go to a local post office and ask to apply for a PO Box (they are free in my city). You get your id and forms sent to said afformentioned post box.   This is what I did when my ID was stolen from me and I was on the street. Since you are 18 there are no questions asked.   For survival tips_ try blend in with a crowd at all times. Try stay the night with friends or in a car if you have one. This is your best bet to stay safe. If not_ you can scrounge out an area for abandoned houses and camp there for a bit (it takes a bit of effort and patience but I used to do this). Or you can sleep in libraries_ airports_ hospitals or on bus/train routes. You can pretend you’re catching a flight in the morning or you’re waiting for someone at the hospital.   Visit local churches for assistance with money_ clothes_ hygiene products_ food stamps etc. Visit local pantries or food drives_ they will provide you with a hot meal_ no questions asked. Remember these people are happy to help no matter the situation.   This sort of thing really sucks and I’ve been through it before as well_ i hope that some of this information is able to help you. If you need any assistance I’d be happy to help best as I can_ please don’t be afraid to shoot me a message. Stay strong_ you will get through this ❤️  EDIT: I’m not going to ask about the mental illness because it’s not my place_ but is there any way that you wouldn’t have to disclose this information to potential employers? I mean I know that’s not the best advice - some places are willing to hire anyone as long as you can do the job correctly. Apply for interviews_ walk into places with signs that say hiring_ test your luck and see. I have clinical depression and at no point in my life have i said “I suffer from depression” at a job interview. Sure_ it’s the truth_ but do they need to know?  No.,Loud-Stable6924,23,1,3,1530

izo9wbg,"Call the police.  If you are 18_ and she does not have some legal guardianship over you because of your mentall illness_ then you are a legal adult_ and she has no legal right to keep your ID.  I cannot speak to this ""credit card"" that you mention.... I don't know how easy it is for an 18 year old mentally ill person with no job history to get a credit card.  On the *one* hand_ these ""banks"" today might be willing to allow anyone who asks for a credit card to get one_ because creating debt is what makes them money.  On the *other* hand... I can't see how a credit card issuer would consider you a valid potential customer_ since you have NO WAY of demonstrating an ability to pay a credit card bill.  So_ I am not sure if you mean an ATM card for a bank account in your name_ or a ""credit card"" that is actually just a second card on your mother's credit card account_ so it isn't \*your\* account specifically_ but only gives you access to her account.... or an actual credit card.  At any rate_ if it is your credit card and your account_ you could_ as has been suggested_ call the card in stolen_ and get yourself another one.  If you have to_ you use General Delivery at your local post office_ for the new address they send the card to.  However... your ID is another matter altogether.  That's why you call the police.  When they arrive_ you tell them who you are_ and how old you are_ and you point out that you cannot PROVE this_ because she will not give you your ID.  She can SAY whatever she wants_ but they are going to WANT to see the ID for themselves_ if for no other reason than to confirm what you are saying.  I would not stop there_ however.  With the police present_ if she shows that she has the ID.... and again... no LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP over you... the police will force her to give it back to you.  You can use this momentum to get the copy of your birth certificate that she has.  Why is this birth certificate important?  Two reasons.  One...f you lose your ID_ you are going to NEED a copy of your birth certificate to get anther ID.  Two... when you need a copy of your birth certificate_ you are going to find out what a pain in the ass it can be to GET another copy.  So... get the one you kind-of have access to now... the one in your mother's possession.  With the police there forcing her to give you the ID_ you can have them also force her to give you the birth certificate.  Don't even bring up the credit card.  Again... call it in stolen_ and get another one issued to you.  If you bring it up because you want it and you won't let go of how you want it... she can obfuscate the issue by countering with how it is HER card_ since she pays the bill_ etc.  If the card and the account are yours_ and you are responsible for paying the bill... the piece of plastic she has can be made invalid_ and you can get another one with less hassle from the card company or bank.  What to pack in your backpack.... a phone charger if you have a phone_ a change of clothes_ an extra few sets of underwear and socks_ the bare minimum of personal hygiene products you can't survive without_ a notebook and a few pens and pencils_ your medications if there are any... that's getting kind of full now_ yeah?  You'll want a pillow and sleeping bag.  Your backpack can work as a pillow_ but people new to homelessness cringe at that.  Of course... a tent would be good as well... but that likely wouldn't fit into your backpack anyway_ just like the bedding won't fit INTO it.  You might have to tie or dangle the sleeping bag from the backpack.",bongart,7,1,8,1024

j0muwvp,I need to check the history of the farm land my grandfather bought which was very close to our home_ but I believe he got it in the 80’s.  It was when interest rates were extremely high and some farms started failing.    It’s actually a bit historic because the community/neighbors would come to the bank auctions_ and would threaten any outsiders who appeared.  It was extremely organized on who bid on what.  Basically_ the community tried to get everything back to the family.  Sometimes there was an issue with the house and/or land_ so someone did have to buy that outright_ but they would rent that back to the previous owners.  In some cases_ a group of people would buy it.  Anyways_ I believe the farm land my grandfather bought was during this period.  The family that had been farming on it for a 100 years is still farming on it.  At my cousin’s wedding this summer_ some of them were there.  They did randomly bring up that “we” really need to increase the rent.  They feel guilty.  My dad and uncle both told them that they were “family” and rent wasn’t increasing.

izk4m3w,"Let's talk about my friends_ M&L first.  They are a couple I met a few years ago.  They wouldn't necessarily call themselves homeless.  They live out of one of those [Datsun RVs](https://www.google.com/search?q=Datsun+RV)?  The cute little ones that have the small Datsun (err.. pre-Nissan) front_ and the small full RV cabover on the back?  Their rig has a punch-out for the dining area as well.  Once a year_ they go up to the Dakotas/Montana_ and they work harvesting sugar beets.  They each come away... after between a month and six weeks... with between $3500 and $5000.  They then proceed to live on that (maybe) $10k_ for the rest of the year.  The rest of the year will consist of them spending a few months here in the winter/spring_ living cheaply... and living with friends/family for a few weeks (out of their RV) in cooler summer locations in NY state_ Michigan_ etc.  They will go from hot springs (wherever)... to rubber tramp locations like Quartzsite... to open BLM land.  Occasionally_ when the party is hard on their wallet_ one might take a few weeks with light work.  Sometimes L will get work at the Fountain of Youth springs up the road from here_ as it is also a trailer park with amenities.  Once or twice a week_ sure... nothing to support anything other than what they might want to drink and smoke while they are in the slabs.  And that's how they live.  On the one hand_ they have their home on their back.  For them_ they can ""rely"" on friends and family_ because their demands are always extremely light... they bring their own food_ shelter_ power_ money.  They just need a place to park it.  They make friends wherever they go_ and they make connections... and most of the time_ those connections are like this...  >Hey M... we are renting a cabin/getting a boat with a few friends.  Why don't you and L come out and stay?  Not like a rich_ bourgeois thing.  These people were slabbing it up with them the previous season_ living just as dirty.

But.... that gives M&L a target to get to... and that eats up two months of the year.  Spots like Pagosa Springs_ this place... pretty soon_ they have to CHOOSE between where they want to go_ as opposed to struggling to find just one.  Are they homeless?  Technically... yes.  I've sat and have had many a smoke-filled conversation with M to know that they are disillusioned with enough of today's crap_ that this is their way of tuning out as much as they can.  It was a conscious_ if not even a subconscious decision on their part.  I'm sure they both gravitated this way before realizing it was the life they wanted.  Homeless by choice.  Nomads.  But when you rotate the point of view out_ and get a wider picture.... it is what they choose to DO with homelessness that is the forest we should be seeing.  Again_ they have nothing ""permanent"" to fall back on_ should things fall apart.  Except maybe limping here.  There are a few of those Dolphin/Datsun campers here that aren't ever leaving... in one piece.  Tried pulling one out of the clay once with my 1989 S10 4x4_ when I first got here.  That didn't happen.  Poor S10. Best $400 I spent in 2015.  Lived in it... carried me 1300 miles from WA to here_ with only three shock absorbers.  Good four year investment.  What makes them different from someone with a backpack and shoe leather?  The camper_ for one.  Yes_ that was shrewd spending on their part... but really... that's not as hard a hurdle as one might imagine.  The trick was getting to where the money was being handed out like candy_ in exchange for ""short"" bursts of labor intensive work.  ***Sprint for a month_ coast for a year***.  I know a few homeless folk who do seasonal work in tourist towns.  These are places that see huge swells in the population only during certain seasons... and many employers will provide housing as well as a paycheck.  The work could be selling T-shirts and beach towels 40 hours a week_ in an air-condition store 100 yards from the ocean_ in a town where everything \*you\* need (food_ booze_ substances_ companionship_ entertainment_ etc) is within walking distance.  And you live above the place where you work_ and you can work in a t-shirt_ shorts_ and flip-flops.  And you get paid cash_ every week with a bonus if you last the full ""season"".    The people I know take the money_ save most of it_ and either use it to fund their ""adventures"" over the winter_ or they get a place in town (cheaper_ with the severe off-season population drop)_ or they go to a different seasonal spot_ and do the same thing.  Provincetown_ MA and Key West_ FL are popular in this regard.  Both cater to tourism heavily_ both see dramatic differences between in-season and off-season populations_ and their seasons compliment each other.  There are many homeless who just bounce back and forth between these two locations_ living in places they don't own or rent that are provided by their employers_ working for cash_ and usually living hard in their downtime.  They aren't on the streets_ because they found a loophole.  When all you have to save_ is the cost of the bus ticket to the place you spend your winter... where you'll be doing the same thing until you only need the bus ticket to where you spend the summer.... and your signature holds you to nothing... you are homeless.  There are other names... but that one still fits.  There needs to be a willingness to move_ as much as the ability to move.  If one is able to work a harvest_ then it is only a matter of that individual being willing to do whatever it takes to GET to that harvest.  Once it is over... once that month or six weeks is done_ there's like $5000 to go and GET some kind of vehicle with.  I'm not even talking the legalities... but it is very easy to prove residency in South Dakota_ with a single night's stay in a motel (aka the receipt)_ and that can be turned around into a license_ and registration for the vehicle you just worked to buy.  At the harvest in that state.  If one needs all of that in one go... there are other states_ and other harvests.  Now... moving stuff around from city to city isn't as much of a problem.  What about what was given up to get the vehicle?  Depends on what was given up.  If it was a tent and camp set up that was finally weather-proof?  You now have a metal and glass shell on wheels to provide a mobile camp.  You can go BACK to where you were_ if you want to.. but now you can go ANYWHERE much faster than before.  When you ask this question... what is the image in your head that you are working from?  Are you looking around you_ wondering what you would do with it all if you were to go homeless?  Are you seeing a tent_ or a tent camp_ and wondering how those people would pack up all of that if someone came along and said ""move""?  Do you imagine that there's a number of people who regularly migrate between homeless tent camps and emergency shelter concentrations (there are_ btw)?  Some reduce what they have_ to what they can carry on their backs... even if they don't move around from city to city.  This is a very secure way to be homeless_ because everything you have_ can be with you all the time.  In regards to mobility_ it is more about being homeless in an area that is hostile to homelessness... where you can never fully depend on any location you choose as being actually secure.  So you need to be able to move without losing anything_ on short notice.  That's why I ask about what inspired the question.... homeless individuals are... individuals.  There's more than half a million of them in the USA alone.  At one point_ I saved for a train_ instead of taking the bus.  I carted luggage_ and two heavy stacks of boxes that SHOULD have been cargo_ but I was exceptionally pathetic and got it all allowed at every station.  Even got one of those big_ wood and metal_ four-wheel hand-trucks in almost every station I needed one.  Fuckin Chicago.  Not the city... just that day in that train station.  That day hurt.  It was in the middle of digging myself out of one homeless situation_ staring down a Northeastern winter_ to be homeless in the pacific Northwest.  Not Seattle.  I mean... I came into Seattle on the train... but I was there for like... and hour_ maybe?  I did get back there for another hour or so_ a few years later.  That's how I moved with my stuff_ from city to city_ when I was homeless in... what... 2013?  In 2018_ I used that S10 I mentioned earlier... that I was living in at the time_ to move me and my stuff from WA to southern CA.  So_ personally_ I've found that the method of moving my stuff_ depends on what I'm moving_ and how I'm getting there.  And if my getting there depends on what I've got... I get rid of shit until it isn't a problem anymore.",bongart,3,2,8,1024

I live in the USA_ as do most readers here_ and apparently yourself_ so the implied nation is the USA.  But we are talking about two different features of taxes: 1) The levels at which taxes kick in_ and 2) the deductions off of those taxes which promote/discourage certain activities by the taxpayer.  The more that #2 is done well_ the less objection I have to #1.  Conversely_ the worse #2 is done_ the more I am concerned about #1.  On the question of homelessness ( which is the issue at hand ) the incentives for the average citizen in the USA are greatly distorted.  This leads to over-investment by homeowners_ excessive NIMBYism_ and consequent rising housing costs.  =================================================  If I were king_ the incentives would be reversed.  Income tax would be abolished_ with all of its loopholes and perverse incentives.  ( Why should we have any tax on productive activity? )  It would be replaced with property taxes on the ground value of their property ( AKA just the dirt ).  This gives all homeowners an incentive to keep the land use small_ which is an environmental plus.  Government programs would be mostly paid for by the rich.  ( They would pay taxes on their mansions directly_ and indirectly on the cost of the Lambo because the dealership would have to cover its property taxes. )  There would be one_ and only one deduction.  Each homeowner would get a personal deduction of about 50K on the value of their property.  Everything above that would be taxable.  This would put small homes - averaging 1000-1400 sqft like almost everyone had in the fifties - in reach of even minimum wage earners.,ThroarkAway,2,3,11,964

iza3nbh,Let's see.  [What does HUD have to say about Florida?](https://resources.hud.gov/)  HUD... the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  They are the ones behind Section 8_ Section 811_ and the Housing Choice Voucher system.  As it turns out... they have a few other tricks up their sleeve.  HUD also provides subsidies to apartment complexes_ in exchange for having a certain number of apartments set aside for low income residents.  You don't need Section 8/811/HCV to get one of these apartments... you just have to make below a certain amount of money.  In most cases_ it is also similar to a Section 8_ in that you only have to pay a third of what you make_ for your rent.  The link above_ is to the HUD Resource Locator. You'd want to choose to Find Affordable Housing Near Me.... the overlay that pops up first has that as the first option to the top left.  Click that.  It will pull data from your connection as to where you are_ and show you all the apartment complexes near you that got subsidies from HUD_ and therefore have apartments set aside.    The resource locator also will show you any USDA low income housing.  An example would be a farm house on USDA land.  Residents wouldn't be required to farm the land... that was already being taken care of.  But... there's still a farm house there.  Someone should live in it... and the USDA works with HUD to make this possible and affordable.  Most of these end up being tax credit properties_ but not all.  And... it shows other low income tax credit properties within urban areas.... but those would be more expensive in the short run_ because you'd be expecting to get the money back when you filed your taxes.  IE... why it is a tax credit property.  I just threw Tallahassee in the search to see what was in Florida.  Within the ring_ there are 14 apartment complexes with low income apartments_ and 11 tax credit property listings.... and the Public Housing Authority location for Tallahassee... where you'd go first if you were looking for low income housing there.  So... find the nearest Public Housing Authority.  Use the Resource Locator to get an idea where the apartments and properties are in your area.,bongart,1,1,8,1024

izaulcc,2. Access to cleaning facilities was definitely missed. I always felt nervous/anxious trying to go for a bird bath in single occupancy bathrooms in places like fast food joints_ because the staff would be hammering at the door if you were in there for more than 60 seconds.   I also missed being able to poop in peace. I've never been one of those quick 30-second poopers; I relax and take my time_ just let it flow_ listen to whalesong. Instead it's public toilet stalls with those weird fucking gaps everywhere and you make awkward eye-contact with people also coming in to take a dump.  3. When I first became homeless I was sleeping rough (on the streets) and I feel you on this one. Sandwiches_ salads_ and cold pasta every day. That or junk food. I definitely missed cooking_ as it was a hobby of mine. I was lucky when_ in my second stint of homelessness_ I wound up living in a few homeless veteran camps that had rudimentary cooking facilities. That was refreshing and fun.  6. Don't write this off. I got more companionship and ass in the ~5 years I was homeless than I did in the 15 years before that. I've dated plenty of girls who were homed while I was not - and they were fully aware I was homeless. I've also been with homeless women too and just recently got out of a nearly 3-year long relationship with a homeless woman I met in a homeless camp. We're both homed (separately) now. Don't write off dating just because you're homeless; plenty of women don't mind.  I SO feel you on losing your cat_ I really do. Myself and the girlfriend I mentioned above got a cat just after we got out and moved in together. After we split up_ this year has been fucking *rough* for me financially and I've come perilously close to returning to homelessness.

iz6i4v6,I remember getting a Subway in New York City and wondering why all the people were on one side of the train while I sat down on the empty side. A few seconds later I realized it's because the only other person on this side of the train smelled strongly of raw sewage. They had clearly s*** their pants and were just sitting in it.  It ended up becoming a source of amusement as I joined the people on the other side of the train and we proceeded to watch people have the same experience stop after stop. That was probably the most disheartening homeless experience I witnessed in New York City but certainly not the only one like the man who was screaming at the sky sidewalk in Brooklyn. I can understand why a city would need to commit people who are like that for the sake of sanitation and order.  Of course there's the worry that this will be over broadly implemented and simply lead to the incarceration of people for poverty.,PurpleDancer,6,1,3,1530

EMT’s aren’t a tool for the state in regard to trying to “solve” homelessness. it’s just simply the nature of our job and that civilians will make calls about the homeless guy who looks like he might be dead laying on wilshire_ or the homeless lady who is sitting in a pool of blood screaming at the sky on santa monica blvd_ or the homeless guy who is running naked on the 405. yes i have seen all of those things.  my personal opinion in general? im not a fan of newsom at all. but the government of california itself can’t be solely responsible for the rampant homelessness here. by virtue of the nice weather and sheer population that is bound to happen. there’s also a misconception that california made it legal to allow homeless encampments to exist_ but that was product of a federal lawsuit if i remember correctly. that being said_ i will once again reiterate that nobody should be harassed simply for existing. having been homeless i understand. but there comes a point when there are homeless who have no intention of doing anything with their life besides doing drugs in their encampments. that’s just not good any way you look at it. or_ as aforementioned_ the mentally ill homeless who desperately need care but wouldn’t even know how to get off the street if that was even a thought going through their mind. those people do exist.   i think they are doing what they can but at this point it’s too far gone and i don’t think they will ever be able to solve it. working fairly closely with police i can also tell you they have a very hands off approach. not enough people and too much to deal with_ i feel bad for those guys. if somebody is not a threat to themself or somebody else or their property they will pretty much ignore it and any ordinance they are supposed to be enforcing. it’s not worth it to them.,treyj88,2,2,8,1024

iz5vrp0,How do they even have space? I'm genuinely perplexed_ because mental health is an area that is underserved nationwide.   I used to have a job where I would have to find psych beds for people who actually needed them and there was almost always a wait. Also_ the hospitals would only keep you for 3 days anyway_ which isn't nearly enough time to stabilize someone in a new med regime_ and just boot the patients back to the real world to fend for themselves.

It would be astronomically cheaper just to house literally every single homeless person_ but this isn't about saving money_ or lives. It's about control.

More likely to accept a shitty place to live with ever increasing rent_ yet without the quality of the housing reflecting the rent raises.

iz3jx3y,Used much of the advice shared here when I had to make my way out to NC.  Came in super handy. Wipes_ are the way to go…never tried corn starch though for body powder. Hmm.  Ended up saving my plastic grocery bags for…well everything.  Cleaned up a bit in a laundromat bathroom that had terrible lighting and toilet paper_ but thankfully my bag had a strap and clips I could hang off of the doors bulky hinges to pull stuff out easier.  Ended up finding a community center once to use_ since I wasn’t going to be in the area long.  Also_ lucked out at a boat dock and separate park close by…both had bathroom facilities. Coldish_ but everything was there. Rotated use.  The boat dock had showers; however_ those were locked with keypad locks. One of the things I’d do in my spare time was pick up a grocery bag of trash_ every so often…some park maintenance employees came by to clean up and so I asked them about it.  That’s when the one guy was nice enough to point out that the women’s door lock was broken (I had never checked it). He thought maybe some young kids or something broke in.  The light dial was broken and of a timer design. Took a few minutes for me to figure out that the head of a standard house key could be used to turn it.  The guy didn’t think the water would be warm_ it actually got plenty hot though. Now the room was cold-that day and time the weather was bearable enough.  The next times I used it…just tried to balance the timing out with the higher temps of the day. No mornings.  I made sure to strap the door since it didn’t lock…just in case someone happened to open it up while I was in.  Other than that_ I had an emergency bucket in my vehicle I hoped to never use again.  For a urinal though…by chance I had a Large Lysol dish detergent jug this time.  Like 220 ounces or something. Best urinal I’ve used yet. Lemon fresh.,missfire23,4,1,3,1530

My friend walked the Camino De Santiago in Europe this year which is apparently a 500 mile stretch that about 350k people walk every year. To me it seems so intense and yet there are humans that willingly do this as a pilgrimage of sorts. They say on average it takes 30 days. Maybe with can read up on preparation docs for that? I know that there are hostels along the way so obviously that part will be different..  maybe you can carry a tent? And another little piece of inspiration that may be of help to you_ there is a woman called Peace pilgrim walked for 30000 miles for peace with nothing but the clothes on her back. She had a shirt that said on the back what she was doing and people offered her stuff but she never asked.  To me that was wild to contemplate.

iyx4eqm,This question gets asked a lot and I always say to people who ask this:  Ask yourself what YOU would NEED if you were homeless or camping for an extended period of time. That's your answer. Think about what you would need to Survive on a winters night in a city when you know you have no where to sleep or stay warm. What would you personally do?  But to your points. 1: Food is really easy to come by as long as you don't care where you get it/find it. leftovers on the street_ entire pizzas in dumpsters_ starbucks dumpsters_ etc. You have to be careful when providing snacks to people. think about allergies_ think about how their teeth are. Many homeless people have really bad gums and teeth and can't eat what you normally eat. Apples? out of the question no way in hell I'd be able to eat an apple when I was homeless as I'd likely lose a tooth if I bit into one. Same with hard granola bars. Soft food is the best option if you want to provide snacks but really a snack isn't going to fill someones needed calory count for the day nor will it fix hunger. Trust me when you're homeless you're hungry 24/7.  2. Underarmor socks were great. Cheap socks will last a couple days at most. Really the only good quality socks are going to be over $20 for a pack. anything under $20 I guarantee you will be torn up in a week or two.  3. Not really.   4. no  5. Gift Cards. Giftcards to a 24 hour coffee shop even better. But grocery giftcards also. allows someone to buy what they know they can eat and get the most calories out of the food.  But yeah don't think things like this. Eating nutritious food isn't something that anyone_ at least that I knew when I was homeless_ even thinks about. It's about calories. The more the better because that's what will keep you moving throughout the day.,UsefulWoodpecker6502,3,1,1,7

zciue7,,iyxnytv,The food banks in my city require a person to be registered and approved. Usually they are only open once or twice a month.   A food kitchen provides anyone who comes in a cooked meal no matter what their income is. Usually daily.
zciue7,,iz1d9gm,The food bank in my city is open to everyone 5 days a week, no questions asked. But you're only allowed to come once a week.   Then we also have pantries that hand out the boxes to people once a week but you have to register for that.
zciue7,,iz1fl0c,I love that! Unfortunately, I'm not approved at the best one in the city because I'm a sponsored permanent resident. Even though I'm no longer with my sponsor with no job currently. I'm working with the Y to find another where I'll be approved.
zciue7,,iz1gslz,They give you 4 empty grocery bags and let you shop for the food you want. Normally it's one bag filled with breads, one bag filled with produce, 1 bag for dessert (my favorite!) and also non-perishables and then one bag for meats/frozen goods.   But hobos call it angel food because you gotta listen to a church sermon before getting the food.

zciue7,,iz57e8o,Raleigh, North Carolina
zciue7,iyxvea4,,Ok, I understand now. We don’t really have food kitchens where I live. There are a couple of shelters and at least one church that serve a meal. More commonly we have various outreach or volunteer groups that bring cooked meals to distribute at a common location like a park or they stop and distribute at a few of the larger encampments.   In my experience the food served in the shelters and a lot of what is passed out by outreach is very *institutional* and frankly pretty gross. I’m sure they are going for quantity over quality.   All in all I agree that food stamps/EBT/SNAP whatever you want to call it is the best way to go. A lot of people supplement that with one or two trips to the food bank.
zciue7,iz1crme,,Yes, they do offer healthier selections. They get fresh produce by the pallets and have farms dedicated solely to the food bank.   The National Guard came and worked on our farms during the quarantine.

zciijw,iyxoema,,Durable outerwear is key, obviously make what money you have go as far as possible.  Online purchases are the hardest for me in a pinch when my reg bank acct is messed up. However, go online to the Rothco site and search up Ranger pantie. They're short pt shorts. They dry super fast, you can literally swim/shower in them and towel off and be dry, thereby cutting down on some of your laundry expenses. Get about 3 pairs. It'll cost you about 72bux online. Or, go to any Mil surplus store and search for the Rothco brand. Soffee is good too but not as opaque.

zchal9,iyxc7z6,,I was homeless for 6 months a good chunk of that time in winter so it couldn't have been a worse scenario. I used to tarp in a hole in the middle to erect a kind of rough tent to put cardboard on the ground keep somewhat insulated and had a mylar blanket and a sleeping bag. As for washing up it was hell but luckily there was my library nearby and they had a single stall so I would literally take my products and sink shower pretty much daily. I'm pretty sure the library probably knew what I was doing since I would come out with wet hair but they let me do it because they knew me beforehand. It allowed me to keep my dignity by at least being presentable. People will still treat you overall decently if you look decent. I would store my dirty clothes in a garbage bag and when I got two full I go to the laundromat and wash my clothes. Sometimes I would have to collect bottles to have enough quarters to do my clothes but I managed.
zchal9,iyxxqxe,,off and on about 4 or 5 years now. currently homeless in LA since march, before that i was in oregon. i sleep wherever i can. sometimes bus, sometimes bench. i have a locker at the gym where i wash and shower before i go to work. i wash dishes for about 40-45 hours a week and take up extra gig work wherever i can. i finished my undergrad this past spring so am now just saving money taking things day by day.

zchal9,iyx4y58,,I was homeless on and off for around 5 years. The most I'd spend outside was a few months at a time but I was mostly surviving in nature. Washing isnt impossible and easier in the summer. I used to go to this creek in the woods and bathe in it once every few days while the water was ice cold it was kinda nice considering the heat. I suppose any natural water source can be a bath if it's clean and not stagnant.
zchal9,iyyayt0,,The first time I panhandled to make ends meet. The 2nd time I had SSI at the time, so it helped. The third and final time, I sold newspapers all day, held signs on the weekend, and went to day labor, and that that allowed me to rent a small room that was horrible. Now I am a college grad, going for my degree in social work, and I have a job working with teens who have mental health issues and drug problems.
zchal9,iywo4a0,,I was street homeless (no vehicle or whatever) for 5 years. I slept/lived in many places. My favorite spot was under a bridge that had a concrete platform and it was divided into sections by concrete walls. They made perfect little rooms. We hung a curtain across the front and it was perfect. I’ve also lived in tents in all sorts of locations, under freeway overpasses, hidden away behind sound walls, etc. I stayed in various abandoned buildings from time to time and even lived in an old traffic courthouse.   I can vividly remember brushing my teeth at a water fountain in a city park in the summer of 2015. I would bird bath in public restrooms, sometimes I would even wash my hair in the sink. I had a gym membership for a while but they went out of business. In the summer I would usually just shower at my spot. I would hang up a tarp like a shower curtain but making a full circle and then shower in there. I hated carrying water so I learned to be very efficient with it. I was able to fully shower and wash my hair with **one** gallon of water if necessary. For getting and storing water I had a couple of the 5 gallon water cooler jugs, you can find them in dumpsters behind businesses and apartments. I would take them in a shopping cart or a folding grocery cart to a nearby park and fill them up either at a water fountain (by filling a smaller bottle over and over, very tedious) or I would use a pair of pliers so I could use the hose spigot.   When you’re homeless you are almost always passively scouting resources. This becomes so ingrained that even now that I have been indoors for two years, I still find myself noticing outdoor water spigots and power outlets.  Edit to add: also having baby wipes on hand at all times was mandatory.
zchal9,,iyxyd1n,that babywipe tip needs to be in the how to be homeless 101 bible
zchal9,,iyywv2j,I used to joke that the two most clutch items when you’re homeless are baby wipes and febreeze. In a pinch you got your shower and clean clothes right there.

Still to this day if I'm out walking around and I find something I think oh I could probably use this for..."" then I have to remind myself_ again_ I'm not homeless. This is especially true for Tarps. Every. single. time. I find a tarp I'm tempted to take it and I don't need it anymore.",Pickles2754,2,1,3,1530
iyz0zqi,This was incredibly helpful Tysm! I’ve never used Craigslist_ if I buy something is it always guaranteed I’ll get my proper item or money back??,Professional-Clue379,2,2,3,1530
iyz1xos,Lol_ nope. Craigslist is buyer beware_ no guarantees. It is strictly peer to peer cash based in person transactions. It is very possible to be swindled_ though honestly I have done a lot of buying and selling there and never had any issues. Just use some basic common sense: meet in a public place_ fully inspect the item before completing the transaction_ always pay in cash in person_ if anything seems off or shady it probably is. People who want to ship things to you or have weird requirements regarding payment are certainly scams. Buying something like a tent is pretty safe_ most scams will be high ticket electronics or cars_ etc.,MrsDirtbag,2,5,3,1530
iyxcor1,Boy do I hear this. Now I get super excited whenever I see camping equipment especially a really good tent or sleeping bag I'm like this is awesome I should totally get this even though I never go camping. Simply because I think Savannah if the power went out or whatever. This feeling of being prepared for the worst case scenario has led me to have a fully stocked medical cabinet which came in handy when I got really sick and my boyfriend did too. Power went out I had my super thermal sleeping bag it comes in handy sometimes,Immediate-Pool-4391,4,2,3,1530

iyy1knj,Off and on I've struggled with homelessness even as a child. But on my own I was homeless for almost the whole last 13 years. Been housed about 6 months now_ in independent_ but rent reduced_ housing.  I had ssi a lot of the time I was on the streets_ and if not_ I was working temp jobs here and there_ including offering to cook and clean in exchange for floor space or couch nights occasionally with friends. But with ssi_ I could go off grid for some time if I so wanted_ and just do extended camping similar to what I'd do if I was housed_ and nobody would be able to tell I was homeless just by looking at me.  Living in populated areas however_ I always had a storage unit_ bus pass_ library card_ 24 hour gym membership_ did movie pass for awhile_ Cafe and restaurant subscription or rewards programs come in handy as well.  Living month to month on disability isn't enough to put down deposit on a place plus first month's rent depending on location_ but it was enough I could have stuff to do throughout the day_ and warm dry places to be. I also learned how to be resourceful with getting free laundry and foodstuffs that I'd be happy to explain if someone wants to know_ just pm me.   If not for ssi_ I'd likely had just done like that one guy did_ Rob a bank for a dollar and wait for the cops. It's damn near impossible to get a job while homeless and keep it_ and fuck being completely penniless_ I've done it before_ but not something I ever plan on again.,nip_pickles,4,1,3,1530

iyx30m7,Friend_ you're doing more than enough.  Time to stop beating on yourself.  As another user pointed out_ we should have a system to prevent people from becoming homeless_ like they do in so many other (poorer!) countries.  Your didn't create your situation_ and the fact that you haven't found your way out yet isn't on you.

You're applying to jobs and applying for SNAP and asking for help.  You're doing just fine_ effort-wise.  Here are some links to info about food banks in Miami:  * [https://www.foodpantries.org/ci/fl-miami](https://www.foodpantries.org/ci/fl-miami) * [https://www.foodbanks.net/miami-fl/](https://www.foodbanks.net/miami-fl/) * [Yelp's 10 best food banks in Miami](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=foodbanks&find_loc=Miami%2C+FL)  Those should be able to get you over the hump while you're waiting for SNAP to kick in.  This last suggestion is guaranteed to annoy_ but I promise it comes from a place of science.  Once you've secured enough to eat_ make sure you get some exercise everyday!  Exercise will boost your energy levels and you'll feel less depressed.  If you like animals_ check out one of the [animal shelters](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=animalshelters&find_loc=Miami%2C+FL).  Oftentimes the staff are happy to let people hang out with some dogs and cats for a while.  Can be a good source of happy brain chemicals (oxytocin).  Keep your head up!

iyx9gs1,I am surprised DD let you do it without proof of insurance of course if you pay monthly DD doesnt stay on top of these monthly . Live in your car for a few months at least you have that. Once the car gets towed or impounded you will be even more screwed. Take any job that will hire you but you should try to park on private  property somewhere with permission so your car doesnt get impounded.  If you cannot afford insurance_ then you really have no choice but to sell the car pocket whatever money you get after paid off. maybe rent a room for a few months and start all over again,Desperate-Long359,3,4,3,1530

You should also go to indeed.com and search for Keller Williams and Kaiser technical college Real Estate licensing course. It's free. It's a lot of really boring information_ but once you get licensed_ you can either work as a realtor or a home inspector_ or both. It's what I'm working on.

I get a small Social Security check but I couldn’t afford to live anywhere on that. At the time I was living with my ex-boyfriend and his family. Things went south in the relationship_ he started getting physical with me_ eventually his family kicked us out.

iyy337l,Well... I needed to care for my dad who had dimentia. I moved from my apartment to his house in another state_ and so I had to change jobs. I didn't make as much as my last job_ but I was going to be living there_ so I thought the difference in wages lost would be made up by not having to pay for rent. Of all my siblings_ I was making the least and I was the youngest with no kids so it made sense that I take the responsibility.   So_ things are humming along for a little under a year and then my dad_ while going for a walk_ fell and broke his hip. This was really the start of the end. The medical bills were piling up and his dementia grew very bad. He eventually healed but his mental state was very bad. I had to stay with him longer and longer and all the while my debts grew because I wasn't able to work as much and his medical expenses grew. Now_ he owned his house outright and it was agreed between me and my siblings and my father that because I was taking it upon myself alone to take care of him_ I would be the sole owner of the house when he passed. (You can see where this is going). So_ two years later I am deep in debt_ but I'm not worried because I can sell the house and salvage my life. Dad dies. My siblings immediately contest my dad's will saying he was not in his right mind when he wrote it. I have no real money to hire an attorney. I go into a pretty deep depression after having my brothers and sister basically turn on me all for a piece of dad's house. It sells_ I get one fifth of the proceeds which doesn't cover all the debt I'm in. Depression gets worse_ I stay with a friend until I wear out my welcome (not her fault_ I basically stayed in bed for three months and had crying fits around her children). I stayed in a shelter and basically had everything stolen. Lost my IDs_ documents_ but I didn't care. I was sexually assaulted several times_ but I was numb to the world. I just didn't care. I eventually wandered down from Washington to Oregon where some nice people took care of me. Then a new person joined the group and things got ugly. Made my way down to California and I'm here now.   So_ yeah. That's my story. It's not that rare. A lot of people are one medical emergency from being in financial trouble. It doesnt have to be drugs or alcohol or mental illness or whatever else people think of us.

iz1ld70,For me_ it was leaving a toxic relationship_ and having to build a life on my own. I had to move away from the city I was in_ leave my decent salary job behind_ and stay with family. The extreme stress and undiagnosed PTSD made it impossible to get hired anywhere_ and gradually money and resources just ran out. Also_ getting off of antidepressants and benzodiazepines_ which are some of the most difficult withdrawal symptoms.  I'm back on my feet now_ but those events set me back for about 5 years of nomadic life. I think for a lot of people_ it's a snowball of bad luck in a short amount of time.

There’s also many jobs that are very fast paced and physically exhausting on the body like construction which can take a toll on your body. People wanna know why people are entitled well it’s because of things like this. If you’re also disabled mentally in any way shape or form_ the system easily works against you. The education system also doesn’t teach you how to do many things like make coffee or make a hamburger in a fast paced way but they can teach you trigonometry and on top of that the cost of living isn’t getting any better and wages have been stagnant.,Camthegreat1234,2,1,8,1024

The system is broken [by design]_ and from what I observed and heard personally_ the social services are inadequate at best_ at worst a joke.

iyz3og5,In my area the best paying jobs are $18/hr (most are $12-14/hr) while the lowest rent is $1500/month.. My body couldn't handle working 60-80 hours a week anymore to just sleep and store my stuff in a leaky rat infested apartment and struggling to do that. All while my sleazy landlord who literally lives in a mansion in the richest city in the state kept raising the rent so he could go on lavish vacations around the world with his trophy wife (yes_ I checked his Facebook profile to find that out_ lol).   The last straw for me was one night I heard a rat scratching and chewing inside the wall right next to a power outlet. The next morning I woke up and saw rat feces on the pillow next to me and realized I was better off putting all my stuff in storage and just sleeping in my car. So that's where I am now. I'm sick of breaking my back just for some rich pos to reap all the benefits.  In this area there's zero help for the poor. No shelters_ no public transit. Nothing. And on top of that the police actively keep the homeless population away. They run off people sleeping in their cars (like me) and will even pick up those without transportation and drop them off at the city/county line and tell them to not come back. Mind you that's usually out in the middle of nowhere and this area still has a known sizable population of coyotes and even the occasional mountain lion.,ineedhelp9999999,1,1,3,1530
iz2i7ew,It was only a matter of time before inflation outpaces the ability to pay rent or afford cost of living. The push to force most people into renting is not by accident. This country was not intended to be a nation of renters but many people have no other choice now. Which means that they are not free. You have that hanging over your head constantly_ worrying about something as basic as a residence nobody can throw u out of. Imagine how much theft occurs from pple who rent. All that money they could use to buy a small plot of land and a small home they could have afforded but can’t because they make it a crime to be poor_ forcing u to rent making other pple rich while u are paying for your premature death thru eventual homelessness bc of having to give most of your earnings to landlords in your prime healthy years.,Difficult_Ad_9392,1,2,3,1530

I got involved in inhalants_ thats when things got a bit rocky some legal trouble lost a few jobs_ but still held it together and was getting sober when all hell broke loose.  My addiction problem was almost entirely a byproduct of severe depression and bipolar_ 3 years ago they changed my medication and I had about the worst possible side effects sending me into a psychotic break with hallucinations_ during this I assaulted someone which I have no memory of_ they continued to give me the medication in jail for 2 weeks during which I continued to hallucinate and didn't even know I was in jail.  Finally they pulled my meds and I came out of it.  Because of my history the courts wouldn't believe in the psych issue and I ended up with a felony.  Once I got out of jail everything I had was gone and I had no job nowhere to go.  I bounced around halfway houses and finally a transitional housing/rehab that i currently reside in.

The rate at which I am paid I suppose to be above poverty level_ at the lower end of middle class_ but with the current economy it's more around half of what the local poverty level is. After the COVID restrictions were lifted_ landlords in Lynchburg_ VA were evicting people to renovate and raise rent. The last apartment I rented was nearly condemned_ with the windows falling out_ little to no insulation_ full of bugs and not in a good area. When the renter offered me another apartment_ it was worse and nearly 60% more expensive. That would have been the third apartment from this landlord_ the first one had leaking pipes and a puddle on the floor that you couldn't keep dry and fungi growing out of the walls.

I've known someone who spent an entire winter outside because he didn't like the people he had to interact with the prior season.  And this was at a pretty tame shelter.  I told him about the atmosphere during the current season_ but prior experiences were enough to keep him out.  This thermal shelter was largely non-preachy but a lot of the unpaid volunteers were from churches and wanted to chat.    I hated seeing him with a wind burned face looking cold_ but it was his choice.  Edit: there were also specific times people had to be places and that conflicted with more than one person's ability to stay in the shelter.  Working a 3rd shift basically made you unable to take advantage of the program.,backpackwasmypillow,12,1,8,1024
iyvzyca,Because homeless shelters are about like prisons.  There's plenty of very mentally ill people_ plenty of dangerous drug addicts_ plenty of aggressive gang members.  Fights are very common_ thefts are very common_ even stabbings_ rapes_ and murder  In nearly all cases_ most homeless prefer the streets.  &#x200B;  In the defense of the homeless shelter's employees_ they're usually hugely understaffed and don't have the people needed to keep the peace.  The government notoriously underfunds any service that impoverished people use_ in order to discourage its use.  Homeless shelters try to make up for being underfunded by having volutneers help_ but most volunteers get scared away from it after one shift.  &#x200B;  America definitely needs to do better with their homeless shelters.,-Ok-Perception-,12,1,6,521

I’ve seen people get a spot and str8 just stay out for a few days doing whatever. Plus I mean some people don’t respect space_ had a guy underneath my bunk watching some weird violent type of porn and it was like 2 am you could hear it in the wholeee dorm.

iyu54eb,The shelters here in the US will kick people out for stupid reasons. That’s why there’s people sleeping outside. I took in my 2 friends (they’re a couple) who was living with someone that kept getting in trouble with the police and was evicted. They had 5 days to find a place. They would’ve been on the streets. They have stayed at shelters and they were really nervous about living like that again. Thank goodness they work,OwnDragonfruit8932,9,1,8,1024

iyskfar,I've been in college towns before. Very different from college cities though. When the college is the major reason for the town_ it's pretty awesome. When it's like Houston or Chicago_ not so much. Every May there's just a bunch of free stuff on the curbs because students move out. Dumpster diving is a gold mine. Frats do volunteering and there's also student ministries so the soup kitchens and coat drives are always doing well. It's cleaner_ richer_ and these kids will just give you food or money. BUT please be aware_ if you scare them_ the cops will be on your ass right away. Never be pushy_ never stand directly in front of a business to fly a sign. You will be able to tell by their body language right away if you scare them. Don't push your luck and you can live a very comfortable life.,ladyinatent,9,1,3,1530
iyto6m7,Well explained. Thank you.  My own college town experience was somewhat similar_ with the exception that at times some homeless were undoubtedly harassed/abused.   I’d like to say mostly this wasn’t the case though. Most people were kind and understanding.   Football game days were here and there_ typically before the game was alright…it was after the game you had to be careful. No matter who you are.   Got some of my own furniture freebies at the end of semesters.   Ten years ago there used to be quite a few abandoned houses that many squatted in…I personally don’t recall any issues. However_ after moving away and over the years of revisiting the area…things have changed drastically and those houses were (I’ll say lightly_ claimed) and renovated.  No abandoned houses exist in the area that I’m aware of anymore due to the market.  There used to be several empty lots that now have houses built on them now_ one we used to gather around on_ with a small camp fire and just have good times.  It’s changed a lot for sure. So much that I personally have lost interest in going by when I’m in the area.,missfire23,1,3,3,1530

It’s the south and the administration is very conservative_ there’s large distances between any place you could potentially sleep and the places you could panhandle_ if you even could. Although the college area is very rich_ the college is supported by a labor pool of poor black folks that live outside of town in old crumbling flats. The police purposefully patrol the old color lines in between these areas so that getting back and forth is difficult.,EndAllHierarchy,2,2,3,1530
iyrhvej,Of course that the ultimate goal but in politics here you gotta negotiate something. All of those things would eliminate a lot of problems for us in general.

There was a compartment in the floor where I kept my powdered milk mix in a glass jug_ wrapped in wet cloth- it stayed surprisingly cold that way. Dug an outhouse_ had a nice firepit outside and a cast iron skillet_ a big coffee pot_ and there were a lot of wild berries which were such a treat in summer. I would never have survived in the city.

I want to know  \- what kind of geography / location / landscape you want to look for for safe_ long term living_ free from wild animals as well as potential harassment from people  \- Should I also buy crop seeds and a water filtration system_ or rain water collection system,Susseroase,2,1,3,1530
iyrnoma,This is nearly impossible.   There are wildernesses left in some parts of the country that you could probably walk miles into and never see another person_ and basically be free to build what you can.   But it's going to be very_ very far from the closest Walmart_ grocery store_ traditional resources_ and you'll require bare minimum .270 rifle and tons of ammo_ lots of cold weather gear_ all traditional survival gear_ and even as an enthusiast I really don't know how you can dry more than a few pounds of meat before a kill goes bad in summer_ maybe if you had tons of huge drying racks and tinder and wood set up_ and drying meat is an acquired skill_ as hunters we take a cooler and ice the meat. And any place with sufficient big game will also have predator animals_ I think the ideal area would have big game like elk_ moose_ or caribou and black but not brown bears_ you don't wanna play with brown bears_ black ones aint really shit and just another food source.  Also I've studied wild plants extensively_ but even if you get to know wild plants_ you'll really only know everything about one given area and if you go 100 km you'll only recognize a few things_ and it is dangerous business the phone and identifying apps are a game changer. From some old illustration in a book you'd probably confuse Queen Anne's lace for hemlock_ whoops lol  Most homeless people are staying in wooded/undeveloped areas bordering cities_ undeveloped land often exists in midsized cities along the river in floodzones. In these areas_ I have seen people build shanties or shacks and the like_ and I've heard of dudes set up for ten or twenty years_ but as times change these places become more scarce and more likely for police to run through_ which is one reason why people who accept or embrace homelessness rather than go to shelter and try to get two jobs are typically always moving around and only possess and invest into what they can carry.   What you're looking for is homesteading_ which is a dead practice that no longer exists anywhere in the world_ and we are all forced to either obey our masters as landless peasants or face heavy persecution_ the entire planet is colonized by central banks cheers,Decent_Froyo_5530,7,1,3,1530

iz3bw4t,I really mean this_ thankyou so much for doing this op. It really can help people and honestly the human element of someone caring can mean as much as the items themselves.  Honestly fruit and sandwiches are not ideal for a lot of people.  small bags of chips like the ones you get in a party pack_ peanut butter crackers snacks_ granola bars or fruit bars are all great. Anything easy on the stomach and tasty is really good. If you can think of anything with vitamins is a good idea like maybe those single bags of cereal that are nutrient fortified.  Something really useful that would be a great thing that most people never think of would be those little rolls of antacids would be really great to offer. Lots of people have stomach issues/ heart burn and those can be a life saver if someone's got bad heartburn.  I hope some of this info helps_ I'm no expert but I would think any of these things would have been great to have when I was on the streets a few weeks ago and I know if anything happens this is what I'd want_ but I'm just one person so hopefully this is a good base of ideas.   I know most people want to hand out healthy food but honestly I know most people I knew myself included just wanted something tasty and easy to eat. Also caffeine in any capacity is great. I know they're expensive but cliff bars  would be a perfect snack.  Seriously thankyou for being kind enough to try to help people in a way that works for them.

I'd appreciate it much more than processed junk that is typically given out_ I believe most of that simply shouldn't be allowed to be sold for human consumption period. But I'd also think stopping to offer me a pack of raisins was a bit silly_ kind of thing someone who wanted to stop to proselytize for their sect would do. I mean 10-20+ packs of raisins though_ or idk how big they are but a good amount_ that would merit my legitimate appreciation.

They never chewed holes in the tent_ they would just wait for the door to be open.   Once when my dog was about a year old a mouse had gone into the tent while the dog and I were out for a walk. When we got back my dog was going nuts trying to find it_ he was pawing things_ trying to sniff behind stuff_ but he couldn’t find it and finally tired himself out and gave up. So not long after the dog falls asleep I’m just sitting on my bed on my phone and this tiny little mouse peeks out from behind a crate. He looks at the sleeping dog_ looks at me and then sprints for the open door. Unfortunately the door was one of those ones that are about 8-9 inches up from the floor. Because of the angle of the tent walls he had been able to get **in** the tent_ but now couldn’t get **out.** So very quietly and carefully_ so I wouldn’t wake the dog I started putting stuff in front of the door making a sort of ramp. Thankfully the mouse seemed to understand because as soon as I finished and backed away back to my bed he ran out and scurried up the ramp to freedom and my dog had no idea.,MrsDirtbag,11,1,3,1530

After looking at it some more (bc of your comment) and specifically researching negative opinions_ it seems that it varies across facilities. California has great resources_ Texas is terrible. No surprises there_ I suppose...  You can try researching the facilities in your state.  What I've heard the most about this program is that they are a good stepping stone if you're putting in the work. So if you are there to learn and apply yourself_ then they will work hard to make things happen for you. This can include a path into community college. However_ apparently they also have people joining who can opt for Job Corps instead of jail. So I wouldn't be surprised if that has an effect on the place_ both in the people you'll be classmates with_ and the structures that exist within the organization. It's not supposed to be a punitive place_ as far as I know_ but if it's used instead of jail_ then I wouldn't be surprised if it is. After all_ the US loves punishing poor people...

iydyouj,The person getting kicked out?   In my experience repeated eviction and not signing into a legit lease is usually because of repeated non payment_ taking advantage of the hosts/clashing with them way too much_ poor financial decisions and not keeping a job_ or abusive behavior. I’ve seen it before with someone who myself/a roomie opened up our home to. She abused my roomie and used risk of homelessness as a way to force my roomie to keep her around.  Not wanting to share space doesn’t seem like a likely reason to be kicked out multiple times.   OP they need to first look at shelters nearby and also look on local Facebook marketplace groups for rooms for rent.

Both of us have bad credit and she has an eviction. We have a HCV but there's a lot of discrimination against it and no source of income or other protection laws where I'm at.  People underestimate how big of a barrier  credit screening  is for the poor when it comes to finding somewhere to live...     So every county should have a Continuium of care that offers homeless serviced and is suppose to work with you and help you secure housing. They will even pay for a hotel for you to stay in. In most counties. But  not for long. I'm not sure what county you're in but you should try to look up the CoC  for that county and see if they can help you guys if you hadn't already.

I ask because Phoenix (like most state capitals)_ Prescott_ Flagstaff_ Mesa_ Tucson_ and Nogales have always had significant homeless populations; and don't say it's because of the Hispanics or Native Americans_ because they_ along with other non European and non African origin people's_ only make up 1/3 of the population in Arizona.   African Americans make up the 2nd largest demographic in Arizona.   White people_ in general_ but specifically of Anglo-Germanic origin_ are the majority in Arizona.   The largest homeless demographic in Arizona_ as in all 48 contiguous states_ is Homeless Veterans.   Like me.   I had a plan; unfortunately my plan didn't include the wave of Californians from Silicon Valley sweeping in and buying up all the available properties that the out of state property investment companies hadn't snatched up.

Which is why most people do not want to see a train come through Gilbert.  And yes_ Californians_ and all the transplants that moved here have ruined the housing market. And if you don’t care about anything_ I have to say they just don’t respond. Thanks but there’s a reason why you’re homeless and it’s probably because of something you did or did not do.

Soooo many Americans are maybe not one_ but 2-3 missed paychecks away from being evicted. It's not the 90s anymore_ 40 hours a week doesn't guarantee you housing_ let alone food and medical care.

iy93qev,You made some bad choices along the way... you expected more from the world than you should have... you work on assumptions more than facts... you didn't change or adapt to your environment fast enough...  ... I'd start with those concepts.  I know you made some bad choices along the way... because I can safely say that almost everyone on the planet has made some bad choices at one time or another in their lives.  Of course... the consequences from those choices will vary greatly... as we are talking globally.  But at least identifying the bad choices and why you made them initially_ can help you from repeating those same mistakes_ when having to make those choices in the future.  I know you expected more from the world than you should have_ because you expected us here to know how you got to where you are_ without knowing at least SOME of the rough details for the landscape.  Going homeless in NYC?  That's one thing and easy to imagine and sympathize with.  Going homeless in Nowhereville_ population 27?  That's another thing entirely and only raises questions... and offers very different obstacles.  What if you have a job_ and you don't do drugs_ and you are about to be homeless because you beat your significant other one too many times... or because you refuse to pay your parent's the money they want for rent... or you've lived with your grandmother for years and she just died and all her stuff went to the state instead of you?  What went wrong.... would be very different in each of those situations.  I know you work on assumptions more than facts.. because you thought the fact that you don't do drugs has some direct connection to how you \***should not**\* be homeless.  That little bit says a LOT about what kind of people you assume make up the homeless community.  It also shows what you assume about the people who make up the **homed** community... like doing drugs makes you homeless.  I know you don't adapt or change to your environment fast enough_ because the likelihood that your impending homelessness happened without some kind of warning or signs is very low.  I acknowledge that this \*can\* happen out of the blue... and people will tell stories about it happening to them that quickly... but many of those stories always leave out a few details that indicate there was time to avoid being homeless.  Again... this doesn't mean it doesn't HAPPEN with no warning.  However... your post here is not a sign of adaptation to your new situation.  Adaptation is moving forward... well... progression.  You are asking about the past... going backward.  Sure... some therapy involves going backwards... but then you are going over the specific details of the past_ and picking them apart painfully.  You aren't doing that here.  So I'd start by looking at these four potential trouble spots.  If you can be honest with yourself_ instead of lashing out in anger_ you may be able to find a few places to make some course corrections and get back on your feet.,bongart,4,1,8,1024

I've seen several people - including myself - work their way out of poverty by simply taking deals that were available.  They didn't ask if they were getting exploited.  They merely asked ""Does this make my situation better?""  If I buy a burger at McD's_ I am not being exploited.  I want the burger&coke more than I want ten bucks.  From my point of view_ I win.  The franchise owner wants ten bucks more than he wants a burger and coke.  From his point of view_ he wins. We both walk away from the deal feeling like we have come out ahead.  This is repeated millions of times every day.  People make deals.  They trade labor or cash_ or cigs_ or whatever.  And each of them sees themself better after the deal than before.

My mom is disabled and part of that includes mental illness. When this happened I had to take over doing everything because it was all too much for her.  We did talk about it a few times. Taking all of our medicines and just all dying together.

iyebhju,"So you are saying that the life they were experiencing_ \*was actually\* worse than death.  Sure... SOME teenagers have committed suicide because they were abused and lived a life of hell... and SOME teenagers committed suicide because they were bullied... and SOME teenagers committed suicide just because they got rejected.... and SOME teenagers committed suicide because of a combination of things.  Are you saying they were ALL right_ when they thought their problems were worse than death?  Every one of them?  Even before their lives really started... they were right in ending them?  EDIT:  Let's save some back and forth.  No_ they couldn't ALL be right in that their lives were \*actually\* worse than death.  Can you be ABSOLUTELY positive_ that there aren't changes that could be made in a homeless person's life_ that couldn't change their mind on their life being worse than death?  Are you ABSOLUTELY certain that there is NOTHING that could have been done to improve things?  100%?  Because if you aren't ABSOLUTELY 100% positive... then it CANNOT be worse than death.  Because death is 100% final.  There's no... ""Oh Wait... you could have done THIS"" to make things better once that line is crossed.  Here's another way of looking at this.  If there is nothing where you are_ and you are homeless_ and you feel that death is a better option.... you are LITERALLY saying that WALKING is worse than death.... that WALKING to a new place to see if things can be different_ is worse than death.  Or rolling.  Or hobbling.  Or limping.  That doing any of those things is worse than being dead.",bongart,3,3,8,1024
iygtmcg,Kids and teenagers have big dreams and hopes for the future to become free adults_ they're very curious and hopeful by nature. If a child wants to commit suicide_ then something very serious happened to him or her. Maybe not all teenagers commit suicide for the right reasons_ but most of them do. I wish there was a way to save their lives_ but unfortunately_ the system is too rotten from its foundation to help them. In order to save their lives_ you need more than a parent's hugs and kisses. You need substantial help_ like protecting the child from bullies or help lower the pressure at school etc.  There are two types of homelessness_ there's a temporary homelessness and permanent homelessness. The temporary type is experienced by young and able bodied people who are only experiencing a crisis_ but as long as they're young and can work_ they can lift themselves out of the situation_ But permanent homelessness is a different story. It's usually experienced by physically or mentally disabled people who can't work and don't have family or anyone who can help them_ so there's no much hope for them and there's a great deal of suffering coming their way. If the government can't or doesn't want to help them_ then Why live in the streets in a disabled body or soul for decades until you die if you can end your  In the end of the day_ it's a matter of respect. Only the person who suffers knows how much suffering they can endure and when enough is enough. Why prolong their agony?  Edit: Just to make it clear_ walking is not worse than death_ but lack of freedom_ lack of safety_ starving_ getting robbed_ beaten and raped daily_ with little to no hope in sight_ is worse than death.,Savonarola1452,0,3,3,1530

iy8k1nk,Yes_ I know how much it is. I live out here. I am lucky I own my home and I bought cheap nine years ago. Otherwise I would be struggling to and probably living with my mom. Since you can’t afford to rent your own place_ a roommate is about the only viable option. Lots of people have to share housing. Your options are to move to a cheaper state but then you’d be leaving your kid or get shared housing or live in your car. You don’t have a lot of options.  Also_ nobody wants homeless in their community. Some are straight out thieves that will steal anything not bolted down. Nobody wants RVs parked in their neighborhood. They don’t live there. So you can’t blame people for not wanting a bunch of homeless in their neighborhood. Many homeless people seem to do very very little to change their situation. There is a way out if you work hard enough. I hope things get better for you. Maybe with a little luck. You’ll find a great roommate in a nice housing situation that works for you.

I work in a shelter. Our snack bags we hand out to the public come in big boxes and some of those bags can sit up to 2 weeks or more at the bottom of the large boxes. The fruit will rot. But fruit cups are great!  pop tops can are perfect_ but not everyone will have a source to cook them. Some stores will allow one to come and use their microwave_ but not many. We take anything out that has to be cooked and put it in the snack room for our clients or in the emergency food storage. Our snack bags are made & donated by our community. We don't make them ourselves. Same with the hygiene bags we hand out.  I can tell you the bags we received to hand out with things like MREs_ and canned meats that don't require cooking or to be refrigerated were a hit. So were the tuna snack packs.

I can't believe how warm this kept me and it seemed to almost not matter how cold it was outside so long as the insulation was 100% coverage. but take it two person tent something with like a four by seven foot bass or smaller and cover it completely with oversized (120x120) blanket you can also use two queen or king size blankets overlapping so long as the entire top of it is covered entirely and then you can put a tarp on that or you don't really have to if you're like me and you're in the desert.  right now anyway I'm using the canvas tent with the stove and it doesn't keep me as warm as my body heat in a small tent did. of course I can always overload my stove but gathering wood and cleaning the stove stocking it up it all takes effort,Rainbow_Golem,3,1,8,1024

ixosjnu,In NY it's the same. I've learned to just cut back on other things_ cut things completely off that are meaningless to me ( had to be honest with myself a ton it was hard) and just work as much as I can but I used weed as a form of reward and not as a self sabotaging coping mechanism. It's a huge different type of satisfaction when you reward yourself with it rather than go to it when times are hard. Reason why I picked weed because rather than other things like alcohol & cigarettes ( yes I know they are cheaper) but they'll ruin ya health much faster plus it's self sabotaging to get pissed drunk then having to work the next morning.,warhead1233,2,1,8,1024

If they ask_ youre living in your car now. If you tell them your living with your mom now_ you get dropped to the bottom of the list.  It's not the most ideal situation_ but see if you can patch things up with your mom to buy you some time.   If things get bad_ a shelter or car camping might be your only option until housing is secure. Look at r/urbancarliving to find helpful ways to stay warm. Fortunatly_ you have some mild winters. Locate your local food bank.   Most importanly_ remember you have each other. Things are about to get stressful_ so remember to be patient_ and know that you are stronger as a team.

ixmnsv9,definitely there would be an interim period where they would face those struggles and i think the comment you made at the top of the post addressed that well.  assuming he enlisted_ he would begin to get paid the day that he got to boot camp biweekly. if he is married and has a child on the way(i’m honestly not sure if they consider that a dependent but i am going to assume they do)_ he would get basic allowance for housing for the price of rent where his wife and dependent are living starting on day one. some of the guys i went through boot camp with who were married made a ridiculous amount of money more than i did; probably 4-5x more.   while in basic training he would have an opportunity to send as much of his money home as he wanted_ up to and including his entire paychecks(which again includes cost of rent in the area his wife is living PLUS his regular salary). he wouldn’t really need that money in training as everything is paid for.   after he got out of training and sent to his duty station_ he would have the option to bring his wife out to him(paid by the government) and either live on base in free housing or live off of base and be paid BAH for his housing(which makes off base housing free in nearly 100% of cases_ most of the time they end up pocketing money after rent).  there still would be that rocky period to begin with which you gave great advice for. i can’t personally say how long it would take to get to boot camp but again in my experience it was never very long. i couldn’t imagine a very eager and motivated person not being able to ship out within at least 2 months_ but again may be wrong…anyways_ to recap_ starting at day one of basic and everyday thereafter they would be taken care of. if the military does one thing good_ it’s taking care of married service members. the quality of life between married and non married is quite disparaging.,treyj88,3,3,8,1024

ixkr9fc,Hey I know u said you're in LA county_ but u can try calling 211 (just like dialing 911) or go to their website. They are service that provides information throughout Orange County but I believe that they do have information for LA County too. They can help you find services for anything.   Also I know it might sound bad but you might want to consider telling them that you are in fact living in your car at the moment just because they'll put you at higher up on the list to receive vouchers or housing or anything like that and I mean so long as you're not on lease or on a title for a home they can't verify it.  Get in contact with social services ASAP. Regardless if you have all the paperwork that you need or not sometimes if the situation is a big enough emergency they will let you receive services or get you started on receiving Services before you have all the paperwork that you need.,2ndbest714,3,1,6,521
ixqzzoh,It sounds like you're still pretty young.  My advice? Join the military. This requires a (mostly) clean criminal record_ a high school diploma and generally decent physical health.

ixklfoa,Maybe look into finding a roommate? If you search “roommates” or “roommate needed” on Google_ some websites will pop up where you can put in your city_ state and find people with available rooms for rent. It’ll be a lot cheaper than renting an apartment. And there are couple roommate websites that have people allowing a couple to move into a room.  And yes there’s plenty of resources for homeless people or people who are about to be homeless. Search “homeless resources” in your area_ or call social services and they’ll guide you in the right direction.   Motel/hotels have extended stays were you pay $200-300 every one to two weeks_ just have to be careful because your stuff can get stolen if you leave your room unattended (I had stuff stolen staying in a motel before).   And especially because you have a baby on the way_ there should be more resources available to you. I also suggest setting up a go-fund me to assist you and your family.,cherribumm,2,1,3,1530

ixmmuqf,Last night_ Kayak was listing motel rooms at the Motel 6 in El Centro California for $31 a night.  Now_ they are listing at $69.  Priceline had them at $39... and now also says $69.  Regarding the one-off or no-name motels_ they are typically even cheaper.  Just before Covid_ they were down to $21 a night in a couple of the seedier motels.  Motel room daily pricing changes_ depending on the demand.  With the holiday_ prices go up.    With the weekend_ prices go up.  They will drop in about a week... and they will go up again as we approach Christmas.  I don't expect you to spend 3-5 hours heading south-southeast_ just to stay in a cheap Imperial County motel.

iypn7d4,"What's your long term plan?  Someone mentioned joining the military below.  As a veteran_ and as a person that has worked with the homeless in your area_ that's actually a good long term decision.  Do a non combat role aligned with the career path you wish to ultimately become.  Here are some other benefits  My kid goes to college for free.  All of the aches and pains I have now in my 40's_ I get paid for by the VA_ whereas if you stay out there_ you will maybe hope for SSDI or something that won't be enough.  My disability payments could take care of the rent in most places_ meaning that even if I am down bad_ I will be able to keep a roof over my head.  Not to mention the education benefits which if you go to school while you are in the military_ you may be able to transfer benefits to your wife_ and let her build up her career so that when you get out_ she's already established_ and you can build yourself up.   You get out_ and you get a government job_ and boom_ you got a decent retirement_ and a cushy job where as long as you just work average_ you got a decent retirement_ and a ridiculous amount of days off. Unless you got something better_ this is probably one of the most surefire ways to change the trajectory of your life_ and your families for you to become the provider I'm sure you would want to be.  Unfortunately_ the price of being a soldier is that you will have to suffer and miss people. I did 2 deployments_ I know the sting. But the life I can provide for my family now with the doors opened up is better than what I could have done coming from the neighborhood I came from.   &#x200B;  Switching gears.  She's pregnant_ so she needs to look for resources for women.  If you don't have a ring on it_ she should look for single resources as well.  211_ cal fresh_ look into Workforce innovation and Opportunity Act  (WIOA) for training for you and your girl for better jobs. If you need side hustles_ Security Guard companies are always hiring_ and you can work the graveyard shifts to not have to sleep in the cold at night.  Get that money before the kid arrives.  Speaking of which. How far along is this pregnancy?  Shot of honesty here_ neither of you are doing the right thing by bringing a kid in the world you can't take care of.  If Abortion is off the table_ then that above paragraph in reference to the military  is pretty much the blueprint for you to make amends to this kid_ but you and your girl need to be prepared to be uncomfortable because that's the price to pay to get to where you want to be in life.  &#x200B;  If you chose the military route_ you have the time from basic to permanent duty station where you will be apart.  You don't need your paycheck because the military will take care of you_ and if she's connected to resources_ and you are still ""single_ then your paycheck provides extra support to her and your kid until you reunite.

What you've got going for you is that you've got things organized. That's great for two reasons_ 1- you know where everything is and if you get in a jam_ you can grab the most important things and 2- if it looks neat_ people harass you less. I packed all my bedding and kept it in the trunk_ looked like a regular car with a couple duffle bags in the back seat. Buddy of mine kept his sleeping bag and pillows out.

ixlf8do,When you get a chance_ get a spray bottle to take showers with. It's not as satisfying as a real shower but it's a way to feel clean anyway (and brush your teeth and wash various other things).  And yeah_ I think the wise thing to do is ask people for money. I don't enjoy doing it_ and fortunately haven't had to in a long time_ but it works_ if you keep at it_ and you can at least get a few gallons in your car.  Oddly_ in my personal experience_ losing my car made my life easier. There wasn't this big_ money hungry machine that needs its paperwork and all that crap weighing me down. Once I accepted the fact that a had to pare down to what I could carry in a pack I relaxed somewhat.  What worked for me wouldn't work for everyone though_ so if you feel you need to keep the car (you could sell it after all_ and buy at least a bus ticket_ gear_ things you need for work_ I dunno)_ you can try asking around at businesses for any odd jobs they might let you do. They might look at you like you have three heads_ or they might be rude but there's a good chance to get a little money if you ask around like that and it may help you make connections.  Your post says you want to vent so sorry if that's too much advice. Venting is cool_ but you are a human being in a tough spot_ nothing more_ nothing less. You have options.

It might help to start with a call there to see what gaps need filling and possibly just get some good information from those already doing assistance work.   As for providing immediate help to people you meet I’ve found what is really helpful is to be prepared. I hate coming across someone in need and fumbling for money_ a bottle of water etc. I live in an area that is very cold in the winter (adjust this based on season) and keep a large Ziploc bag in my car with some:  Hot Hands and Hot Feet_ snacks (granola bars_ nuts_ dried fruit_ jerky)_ hygiene wipes_ pads/tampons_ a Dunkin’ Donuts gift card_ wool socks_ a mini flashlight_ a small plastic poncho_ an emergency Mylar blanket_ and a mini first aid kit.  This might not be possible if you walk or take public transit_ and the needs of your community may be different. I’m not sure that anyone knows what would be most beneficial more than the people currently living unsheltered. It might help to ask? See what would be of use?   I’d like to think the concern that the money may be used for drugs comes from a place of not wanting to contribute to further harm_ but it is reductive_ judgmental_ and unfair. I know many people struggling with homelessness do have untreated substance use disorder_ and that’s a public and private health crisis_ but I’d hate to see that used as a reason to ignore the needs of our neighbors.

iy20n2q,Was thinking similarly myself.  The top replies hit this one on the head_ ASK what is needed_ then return with what you can get.   Personally_ yeah I like coffee_ but certainly do not need expensive Starbucks.  Just plain black_ easier on the stomach the better.  Honestly_ I’d drink hot water and put the money elsewhere personally.  Not completely against gift cards…they’re just severely limiting and as pointed out_ not always a sensible choice to purchase goods and services with.  Best to Ask what is needed first_ could be socks_ gloves_ etc. You just won’t know_ unless you have that conversation.

ixggig1,If you're going to stay at the apartment you need to be discreet_ move your car around unless it's a spot you are  paying for and assigned. Be ready to be out of the car before people are going out to their own in the morning_ anyone parked near you may report you and it's unlikely management there will be okay with the situation. Stay organized and neat_ a messy car means bugs or rodents_ and if you're lucky enough to avoid those it gets stressful. Arrange your clothes by what you want to wear_ plan out as many outfits as you can and keep them together. Get a sun shade_ it's normal to leave in a car window all the time and is great for privacy. If you can put one in the back too. It's getting colder so layers are super important. A sleeping bag is the best_ my sleeping pad is what truly makes my jeep comfortable. You want a layer below you as well as above. Fuzzy socks are life_ and I actually use my old COVID masks to cover my eyes and nose while sleeping. My nose is always cold and it's the best thing I've found to help. The library is amazing and totally free_ sometimes they have rooms you can book for privacy for things like zoom calls. If you don't have a card find an old bill and your id and get one. I love coffee and spend a couple mornings a week at starbucks_ free wifi and always tons of outlets. Planet fitness is great for showers_ if you're there during slow times it'd be easy to charge your things in the changing room.

ix72hhd,GIS is like Google maps_ except it's with local property. Just internet search: Maken County GIS  Or: Metropolis City GIS  But GIS is useless without knowing what to look for.   There's normally a publicly available list of people and businesses who are behind on their property taxes because the government always wants their money. Many of these properties are abandoned and landlocked. I'm talking about raw land because you're not gonna find many abandoned houses.   If I find a property that 30+ years behind on their property taxes_ then that's a good prospect. Also look for property owned by dead people.  Or you can just search the GIS map for property you already know is empty but you need to get the ownership information for it. Like something you drive by everyday but never really paid close attention to.   Also look for landlocked properties. These properties are abandoned because they have no legal easement (driveway connecting to the road) but... if there's no connection to the road_ then nobody can see it from the road. 💡  Then the lowest hanging fruit is county/city delinquent tax foreclosure auctions. Here you're more like to find empty houses but it's not safe because it's easy for others to find the auction listing. Lots of people will come around to view the property before bidding at the auction.  Although_ sometimes the tax foreclosure auctions will list junk property that absolutely no one is interested in. Like irregularly shaped or sized properties.,Oviris,15,2,3,1530

ix19q7k,I got you Piano Man!  Denver_ CO Ways to help homeless people shivering in the Colorado cold creator avatar David Heitz 3 hours ago https://img.particlenews.com/image.php?url=2aFZpd_0jH3FHWJ00 Islandworks/Pixabay By David Heitz / NewsBreak Denver  (Denver_ Colo.) So maybe you’ve seen a homeless person shivering on the street_ their breath visible it’s so cold. And at that point in time_ maybe you decided you want to help.  Here’s a listing of ways you can help people experiencing homelessness during the winter. These ideas came from people who work with those experiencing homelessness_ including Ayla Ray Leonard and Kevin Raleigh of Colorado Coalition for the Homeless_ and Trevor Baringer of Denver Rescue Mission.  · Buy someone a cup of coffee so they have an excuse to hang out in a coffee shop for a few hours and warm up. You can buy $5 McDonald’s gift cards to hand out if you’re able.  · Distribute hand warmers and socks. These inexpensive items can be lifesavers for people experiencing homelessness. Socks get wet when you’re homeless. Chronically wet feet deteriorate.  · If you own a business_ allow people to come inside for a while and warm up.  · Offer to walk with or drive someone to a shelter or to the library. “If you’re prepared to engage with people at that level_ people will appreciate it_” Leonard said. Baringer agreed_ adding “nothing is wasted” on efforts to help people experiencing homelessness. “It truly is going saving someone’s life.”  · Hand out bus passes. Some people have a place where they can stay in cold weather_ such as a relative’s or friend’s house_ but have no way to get there.  · A complete listing from Colorado Coalition for the Homeless of ways to help unhoused people during winter can be found here.  Homeless advocacy group demands more  Housekeys Action Network Denver_ a homeless advocacy group_ issued a press release Friday asking for donations of tents and sleeping bags. Donations can be made to Mutual Aid Monday.  During the Safety_ Education_ Housing and Homelessness Committee Wednesday_ city staff downplayed stories of homeless people being turned away from shelters. According to HAND_ the reaction underscored “the complete dismissal of what houseless people themselves are telling them is happening_” the news release stated. “Many of these incidents were reported and witnessed directly by advocates and the City's own outreach partners and still this reality is denied.”  According to the HAND news release_ “This committee meeting made it ever more clear that City and community action is needed to try and stop people from suffering and dying this winter. Already this winter it is our understanding at least two people have died on the streets due to exposure to the cold. This cannot be a standard we accept.”,Givemeallyourtacos,10,1,11,964

ixg6btc,> Closing all public restrooms after 10pm. I remember when I was in Seattle I couldn't find any cheap food or beverage under like $3.  Its because junkies go in there_ piss and shit all over everything then pass out in a Fenty fold and no one wants to put up with it. Its impossible to find a public toilet anywhere in Seattle because of homeless junkies ruining everything for everyone.   > Also store workers telling us to leave our backpacks at the front when we shop.  Because shoplifting is rampant. Guess who is responsible for virtually all of it?  > I just left because some hot chocolate and cookies just is not worth all that.

ix2d6x0,Jesus what these cities are doing is inhuman. I live in Montréal and have several homeless friends (I've been homeless before). As long as homeless people aren't endangering themselves or others they are left alone. They are allowed to sleep in the subway (when open) especially during winter.  Edit: one of my close friends actually sleeps everyday in the same subway_ same spot. I pass him on my way to school. While he sleeps he puts out his panning cup near him. People put money in it while he sleeps. Only one time did someone dare to steal it. Other people woke him immediately pointing at the person who took it.,Imaginary-Roll9110,2,1,8,1024

ix0gomj,"Well_ we are getting one extremely skewed side of this story. What's up with taking someone in and starting a relationship? That's not charity. If it were a man who took in a homeless woman_ we'd all be crying assault. This person has ""volunteer"" flair but they talk like a hateful republican. I don't believe a word of it.",Purple_Channel_9147,2,3,8,1024
ix2l0sa,I have been volunteering for almost two years..it has been interesting to say the least. Many homeless folks that I referrred to as not being very intelligent_ simply do not think long term. In many cases_ yes_ irresponsible. I do see these folks on occasion playing lotto...stupid. And some_ quite simply_ are simply not smart enough to do_ or keep a job that pays anything...this is not meant to be a knock on them..I am not smart enough to be a Dr for instance.  And some folks cannot comprehend what it takes to reliably put cans on the shelf at Dollar General_ or whatever. These are not bad people_ just not very bright_ and have no one to help them.,Texan2116,2,3,11,964
ix3w743,"Hmm.  So... ""a lot"" of homeless aren't intelligent_ eh?  And now the people who work at places like Dollar General aren't very intelligent either.  This list just gets longer over time_ doesn't it?  And not thinking long term is a sign of not being very intelligent?  That's odd.  You have to LEARN how to think long term... you have to LEARN the difference between dreaming and planning.  This is not something that people are born with like a genetic memory.  Chess is a game of thinking and planning moves ahead of your opponent.  Not every INTELLIGENT person can play chess_ or even provide a competent game.  A lack of ability to play chess well_ is not a sign of a lack of intelligence.  It is a sign that a person lacks SPECIFIC knowledge.  I'm getting the impression you equate intelligence_ with what knowledge one has... that if one doesn't KNOW something_ this automatically means you classify them into the ""stupid"" category.  I mean... here you are_ saying that people who never learned how to plan ahead properly are not very intelligent... when it is simply a lack of knowing HOW to plan ahead properly.  Homeless people playing the lottery are stupid?  Is that because **everyone** who plays the lottery is stupid_ or is it only stupid when homeless people play?  >These are not bad people_ just not very bright_ and have no one to help them.  Who said they were bad people?  Not me.  But saying ""these are not bad people"" does **not** give validity to your assertion that they aren't very intelligent... like you thought it would.  You look down on others_ and you justify it by lying to yourself about your own benevolence.  You don't acknowledge when you have been wrong.  You are definitely part of the problem.  You've pre-judged all these people you could never possibly know_ and you do it with the most specious logic.  I wonder if this is all just projection on your part.",bongart,3,5,8,1024

ix1xx42,It's a little bit similiar with social housing_ we got in my country in Europe and we had to change the approach to it; in the past_ they just gave apartements to homeless people without much support. But today_ it's different_ like these buildings have an office of social workers inside the complex that is open 24/7.   The staff there makes sure_ everybody is well and alive. They help with the paperwork_ get the homeless places for therapy and recovery_ for detox and rehab. They make welfare checks and make sure_ nobody is a hoarder etc.  With this close monitoring and help all the time_ it's much easier for the people to get off the street and stay off the street in long term.,Diacetyl-Morphin,3,4,6,521

iwy7vaq,The times I've tried the shelter was always some nonsense they had a six or 7:00 p.m. curfew_ you couldn't bring too many items in my case all I had was a backpack with an extra pair of jeans and three underwears in it_ theft was rampant_ or other homeless folks will try to bully you_ security was non-existent in certain places.   If you had a car and they found out about it they would give you a hard time.   There are some shelters where the staff abused the hell out of you I was at one place briefly where the females got to go to rooms where they had cots and stuff but I suspected that they were being abused_ and the males were forced to sleep on basically a glorified basement floor with rats scurrying around.   The shelter system is a joke if whoever funds them doesn't actually monitor what these not for profits do with the money. I remember one Thanksgiving Day they were trying to serve us turkeys and the food was spoiled like the taste and  everything was spoiled and anybody who said anything was basically threatened with eviction or ejection.   Another shelter I was at this time I was working as a janitor there and still l living in my car that had supervisor basically expected some sort of bribe in order for them to do anything for you I mean he didn't outright say it but you can tell.    One shelter I stayed at they wanted us to put our backpacks in a secure room some people cooperated and then the next morning they're throwing our backpacks in the dumpster and threatening us with police if we went and got our backpacks. I got my backpack anyway.,johnfro5829,7,1,3,1530
iwz8bwp,I never used shelters. The many times I've been homeless I've also had jobs (sometimes multiple) and the curfews/line-ups/bed vouchers were too much to deal with when all I wanted was a place to sleep between shifts. Or somewhere to relax on days off so I wasn't just spending all day in a library or meandering a mall. Much easier to find a park and string up a hammock or in winter buy a tent_ sleeping bag_ and portable battery heater. If I'm getting kicked out at 8am and can't return until 8pm; might as well not even be there at all. Not every job is 9-5.,BlondieBabe436,8,1,9,1231
