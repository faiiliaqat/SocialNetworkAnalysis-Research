10y47g3,j7w1hrz,,Congratulations and best of luck to you!
10y47g3,j7x0e1e,,Congrats! That‚Äôs a huge accomplishment. Feel good and keep going.
10y47g3,j7wr67b,,This is the way!!
10y47g3,j7x7biw,,HUGE win!
10y47g3,j7ybryr,,Congratulations!
10y47g3,j7zr1kq,,Congratulations! No small victory but one of more to come.
10y47g3,j82ysek,,How did you get a license without a legal address?  I've been fighting with the DMV for 2 years over it
10y47g3,,j85wyxs,There are some charities that revolve around getting PO Boxes for homeless people for just this reason
10y27vy,j7x1vto,,Op, never depend on a storage unit to sleep in. That‚Äôs like rule #1
10y27vy,,j7zpy2n,I know, but I was desperate and the new town i‚Äôm in doesn‚Äôt seem to have the safest parts to rest. But you live and you learn.
10y27vy,,j82rhyx,I feel for you. Sorry you‚Äôre going through this üòû
10y27vy,j7w1d4j,,I hope you tell him that he is a POS for not giving you advance warning and that you could have died last night.  Although, if you come off as hostile he might be an even bigger jerk going forward.  What will you do now for storage?  What if you got a job working at a storage place?  Would it be easier to sneak in and live there?  You could stash your paychecks and live for free until you can save up to rent a place.
10y27vy,,j7w2vyd,I haven‚Äôt been back during office hours as I had an interview at a fast food place this morning and then I hopped on the bus to the library cause I wanted to sit in heat for as long at possible.   I don‚Äôt know what to do for storage now as I still should technically have access to my unit until the end of the month. I don‚Äôt have enough money to switch units and also I don‚Äôt want to roam the streets with 2 huge suitcases and a backpack as I can‚Äôt keep an eye on them every second. Also I have no clue how I‚Äôm supposed to get my stuff since if I don‚Äôt pay for the next month my unit could possibly go to auction and I have some important documents in there like birth certificates etc.   Getting a job at a storage unit is a good idea, I‚Äôll look into it and probably switch jobs if I come across or get offered a job there if the one I interviewed for today doesn‚Äôt call back.
10y27vy,j7x88ds,,Were you locked out because you were living in it? It sucks but you cant do that and people start fires all the time in them. there was a massive storage unit fire in Dec in Mesa AZ determined likely caused by transients in a unit. Call 211 to see if any resources can help.
10y27vy,,j7zpmsc,Yea, I would just sleep in there on top of my 2 suitcases and a backpack. I understand being kicked out I just thought a heads up would‚Äôve been nice so I can grab my winter stuff instead of freezing. Also maybe my money back as I spent some of last on getting the unit and now can‚Äôt even enter it.
10y27vy,j7yhztz,,Sounds like a right prick to be honest
10y27vy,j7vocfa,,God. You are a customer, and even a new one. This isn't even about basic humanity, this is worse.
10xy695,j7v10ei,,Ugh I hope he was fast asleep and didn‚Äôt feel anything üò¢
10xy695,,j7wr7px,Not to be that guy but I'm certain the sensation of being crushed to death would wake anybody up out of even the deepest sleep.
10xy695,,j7xlo4l,Maybe shock protected him from feeling.
10xy695,j7utyi7,,[https://www.foxnews.com/us/illinois-homeless-man-crushed-death-garbage-truck](https://www.foxnews.com/us/illinois-homeless-man-crushed-death-garbage-truck)     **Illinois homeless man crushed to death inside garbage truck, some blame cold weather**     An Illinois homeless man was accidentally crushed to death inside a garbage truck last week after he was believed to have been trying to keep warm inside a dumpster, according to local reports.     Lee Roy Stewart was found dead Thursday at the Waste Management facility in Springfield, FOX Illinois reported. Investigators believe Stewart was in the dumpster when it was emptied into a garbage truck.     Stewart, who was homeless, "died of crushing injuries consistent with the equipment used to transport garbage," Springfield-based newspaper the State Journal-Register reported, citing the Sangamon County Coroner Jim Allmon.        Allmon said that it was unclear whether Stewart was sleeping or disoriented. He confirmed that the 58-year-old was alive at the time he was crushed and said that foul play is not suspected.     While investigators are still working to determine why Stewart could have been inside the dumpster, advocates of the homeless say he may have been trying to keep warm during the cold weather or find a place to sleep.        "They find a spot where they're off the grid," Julie Benson, president of Helping the Homeless in Springfield, told the station. "They can get comfortable where they're at. That‚Äôs their home."        Stewart is not believed to have been from the area and authorities were seeking his family members following the accident.     On Saturday, Allmon confirmed to WICS-TV that officials located Stewart‚Äôs family but did not elaborate.
10xy695,j7wenj8,,I can‚Äôt imagine how the garbage men who did it must feel. So awful all around
10xy695,,j7xezb9,Based on the average corporation‚Äôs relationship with the homeless population, they probably got a nice bonus and another week of PTO.
10xy695,,j7yo2ro,They're talking about the person. You don't really get into sanitation because you want to hurt people like cops do.
10xy695,j7vaqdg,,Rip
10xy695,j7uvg6g,,Don't fall asleep in the dumpster.
10xy695,,j7uwb5a,Don‚Äôt even rest in there.     Dive, scavenge, get out.
10xy695,,j7uwyij,with ninja-like effiency, haha.
10xy695,,j82qnr5,Yeah fk this guy, it was his own fault. Sleeping in the bin? 4 real lol?
10xy695,j7x34v7,,This almost happened to a friend of mine. Managed to jump out right at the top diagonally and over the side not falling in. He broke both his ankles really bad. Said he sorta jumped/threw himself diagonally as hard as he could trying to clear the edge and that as soon as he cleared it knew he was getting fucked up from the long way down.  He got lucky but being homeless with to shattered feet would have to suck bad even if some people were nicer fuck that.
10xy695,j7vf4g2,,If he could have gotten a small no strings private room in a homeless shelter, he would have been alive today. But people out there are convinced that they must act sadistically with homeless people, especially men, And design every shelter for men to be extremely communal and In your face with 50 men to a room. People with mental disorders cannot survive in a setting like this, and will avoid it like it was aids.
10xy695,,j7x1uc5,(sidenote: the aids comment doesn't quite fit here. the at risk don't usually take much precaution to avoid it.)
10xy695,,j7yevag,It isn't sadism, private rooms are expensive. My county just got or is going to give 22 million to homeless efforts which sadly isn't much. You can't even just give everyone an apartment and walk away. Many need supportive services. It's a tremendous amount of money.
10xy695,,j89gxth,Yeah, but our country can give out billions to incompetent executives of failing companies.
10xy695,,j7yvssu,If they can pull off private rooms in family shelters for women and kids, they can pull it off for men too.  This is SADISTIC discrimination.
10xy695,,j80vbsa,Shelters for women are communal too. You're mad children get private rooms?
10xy695,,j880bb2,Yes, he is.
10xy695,,j88090p,It‚Äôs not discrimination.   There‚Äôs limited resources which means the most vulnerable have priority. And by vulnerable I mean 78% of homeless women have experienced some kind of sexual or physical assault. I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain why homeless kids are vulnerable.  Not saying it‚Äôs not fucked up. Just saying this has nothing to do with discrimination.
10xy695,,j88egxu,There are limited resources. So instead of distributing those resources evenly to those who need it, We're just going to give it to  Groups of people that we pick? Based on the way they were born? And let the other group die?  You're right. That's not discrimination at all ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10xy695,,j7xs15z,How many homeless people have you taken in to care for?
10xy695,,j7xtawm,Found the troll.
10xy695,,j7xux69,That‚Äôs what I thought
10xy695,j7uztkd,,What a way to go R.I.P
10xy695,j7v5kp2,,Dumpster camping should never be a thing... Rest in peace soldier.
10xy695,j7y04h5,,Stories like these always break my heart. America is more than capable of providing more assistance to people in this situation and they just CHOOSE not to. The poor man must've been VERY desperate to stay warm and probably thought the only way he would survive the cold is to take shelter in a bin. RIP
10xy695,j7y31tk,,*squints* username is "morbid ways to die."  What exactly is the reason for this post? Because I understand wanting to keep up to date on the community but this is really suspicious.
10xy695,j7ye7pm,,Meh. Desperate enough to be in a dumpster but not a shelter? I might go to jail bf crawling in a dumpster for warmpth. Jesus. Just trespass somewhere you actually want to be, like idk....hospital waiting room. Try to sleep and then accept it if a police officer says have to leave or go to jail. Say well, I've nowhere to go so jail it is I guess. How long does a trespassing charge earn? If drugs are why he didn't want to go to a shelter or whatever, man I just don't know. If someone would rather be in a dumpster than detox, I just dunno what can be done for some people. Here you can check into county psych ER anytime day or night to ' detox' off anything. For opioids they will give Suboxone. Xanax they will taper and then monitor you. I might lie and say I need to have help for drugs even though I don't to get inside. I'm extremely adverse to being outside and if I was used to it I'd get extremely adverse to it in life threatening temps, but my desperation would lead me down different paths. I just don't get it.
10xy695,j7v7dyi,,wtf there needs to be a law to check the dumpters for signs of life before picking it up.....
10xy695,,j7v8tgu,People will just start locking the dumpsters to avoid liability.  Unintended consequences.
10xy695,,j7v93cx,well it be opened first before or make it illegal to lock it
10xy695,,j7x3h02,Its a dumpster. As awful as this is it is no one else's responsibility but the person in the dumpster. Those trucks are not exactly quiet either.
10xy695,,j7x93j8,True..
10xy695,,j838k6b,The problem with this is the drivers would be liable. They would have to look under every bag and piece of cardboard because there could be somebody in the dumpster but not on top. This would take a whole lot of time.
10xy695,j82r16t,,Fk him lol. Did you see his face tats? I bet he was a menace to society anyways and who in their right mind would go to sleep in the dumpster anyways. This dirty bum got what was coming to him, can't say i feel sry.
10xy695,j89ibv6,,Lotta compassion in some of these comments. It's obvious that many of you have never been homeless, and consequently think you're better than those who are. Blind and foolish arrogance. Every single one of you is just one bad day away from being on the streets yourselves. One bad day, or in some cases minutes or seconds from losing everything. Sorry to say, it would be the best thing in the world for some of you assholes. Teach you some lessons you need desperately to learn.
10xy695,j8bkonz,,heartbreaking and for anyone making jokes on here , you are sick, this is a human being that got killed ok??
10xv1r7,j7ukr0k,,Good for you, it‚Äôs a tough adjustment but the stability will definitely help and this is something you can build on.
10xv1r7,j7vd3z6,,You‚Äôre probably falling asleep so easily because you finally feel safe doing so. Your body knows you‚Äôre in a safe place now and it‚Äôs trying to catch up on rest.
10xv1r7,,j7vmwa1,It really is a beautiful development, take the chance to replenish OP!
10xv1r7,j7ujh34,,Congrats man üòé
10xv1r7,j7um7xx,,Glad for you.
10xv1r7,j7uo31c,,Congrats!
10xv1r7,j7x7nfi,,It's still better than being homeless. Good luck!! Work on getting and keeping a job and maybe eventually sharing an apt with 1 other person?
10xv1r7,,j7xf970,I had a series of traumatic events over the last few years on top of my existing meantal health problems, and I ended up unable to work. I tried going back to work full time in August, and it was too much too soon.   I have an application in for SSD. It was a SOAR application, which is done with the assistance of a social worker. They're for people who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness and have a serious mental illness, medical impairment, and/or co-occurring substance use disorder, and they have a 90% acceptance rate. I should get an answer next month.  Once I have that income, I can ease my way back into working. If you are getting SSD and start working, your benefit decreases by a dollar for every two dollars you earn. If I try and get a part time job now, I'll get denied SSD.
10xv1r7,,j7xqddt,yes but SSD is such little income...you are better off rentering the work force. How can you possibly live off of 900/month or whatever it is you will get? I suppose its ok temporarily, better than nothing
10xv1r7,,j7yff1m,Yeah. 941 as of this year. Only doable on section 8 OR this mental health program op in is might have a housing program too OR there might be another group home with at least a private bedroom. Op I'm really happy for you that you're warm and fed and your roomie is cool!
10xv1r7,,j7z6yzv,SSD is based on past income. I'll get around $1270/month. That's not ideal, but I also get SNAP and Medical Assistance. If I get a job that pays significantly more than I'll get from SSD, I'd lose those benefits.   Also, I have a four year old son. SSD will provide an additional benefit (half of what I get) for him.
10xv1r7,,j80vues,SSDI, your benefits are not reduced if you earn money unless you earn enough to lose benefits which is like 1250/ month and even then you can sign up for. A 9 month trial work period
10xv1r7,j7xrfqx,,Might want to invest in an alarm clock
10xv1r7,,j7z63vg,I have tablet that I use as an alarm clock. Falling asleep in the evening was a surprise, so I didn't set it. I set it for ECT (I actually set three alarms at ten minute intervals). I have vague memories of waking up to each one, panicking that I was bothering my roommate and silencing them.  I think I'm past that problem at this point. The past two nights I went to sleep at around 10:30pm and woke up before 7:00am without an alarm.
10xv1r7,j82im68,,I was worried that my snoring would be a divisive issue with the guy I share a room with. His snoring is worse than mine.
10xv1r7,j89kz7z,,Hey brother! That‚Äôs sweet. Keep it going, this isn‚Äôt the end of your journey
10xscjn,j7tzd5k,,Weird. My experience has been that rich people don't seem to be any nicer than working class people, I've gotten more regular kick downs and even housed up from working class people, and the cops are actually quicker to get on me in rich neighborhoods
10xscjn,,j7u3s3g,I second that.
10xscjn,,j7uncnm,Occasionally I would get handed a hundred dollar bill and once $250 but I can count the times on my hands. I've have not only gotten much more help from working class and poor people but outside of bitter Republicans yelling get a job I have not been openly looked down on and disrespected amongst the poor as I have the rich.
10xscjn,,j7vbiuu,Yeah I have on occasion gotten a random fat kickdown from some wealthy person. Like you, I could probably count that on my hands.  I've gotten kickdowns from poor working folks who can least afford it innumerable times, as well as welcomed into their homes and housed and fed
10xscjn,,j7xszm9,When i was forced out of my rental and i wanted to get out anyway, all my former neighbors were wealthy but extremely ignorant and stingy. They don't give time of day or snow in winter. They could offer a room, garage storage, money, food. I would never ask them for anything but they had no trouble asking me to help them which involved a lot of my time and effort and i never said no. When i told one neighbor i may end up camping in my car, she stopped talking to me.  For a while i stopped telling others about my situation. Then i wanted to see people's reaction. I told some peers, different agencies workers, some random people i talk to for whatever reason. When i say i'm homeless they don't react. I don't know if they think i want to ask them for help or money or a place to stay. I never do that. My homelessness experience revealed  many true ugly evil individuals around me.
10xscjn,,j7xqrse,True. My current area is wealthy but worse than where i used to be. I don't get involved with cops i keep distance from them and don't give them any reason to approach me. I completely ignore them. Wealthier population is different.
10xscjn,,j85j96u,100% that cops are much more quicker to respond and motivated to keep people in wealthy neighborhoods happy if they have an issue with anything
10xscjn,j7u106q,,Man most rich people hate homeless people because they‚Äôve never struggled to the extent that being homeless was even a fear. Hate what they don‚Äôt understand.  Working class people fear homelessness and usually have sympathy for those in a position they themselves could easily be in.
10xscjn,,j7uo6in,We don't make the capitalists, shareholders, and temporarily embarrassed millionaires money so we are a waste of space and time to them.
10xscjn,,j7u45pb,Yup.  It's the kind of blind and willfully ignorant hatred that you might notice in people who are overly racist, sexist, or stuck in some religious tunnel-vision.
10xscjn,,j7u4ato,But.... If you can find some wealthy allies, keep 'em!   There are still some wealthy people out there who still have their feet in the dirt.
10xscjn,,j7v9tzw,You're describing one of the two major political parties in the US today.  Nothing will change until they are consistently voted out of power.
10xscjn,,j7vdlgy,Please don't put words in my mouth.  I see this kind of attitude from every side of the political spectrum, and much fucking further than that.  Fuck both of your political parties.  None of them represent you, or most people in your country.  You were just indoctrinated from birth to play your role on one side of a staged fight, and you don't have a big enough perspective to see it.   Please correct me if I'm wrong.  I sure fucking hope I am.
10xscjn,,j7wq3wl,Your 100% right!! I wish more people could understand what's happening.
10xscjn,,j7vtock,The parties are just two sides of the coin of our capitalist overlords. Dems just play "good cop" and the sooner masses wake up to the racket of our rigged electoral system the sooner we can actually start fixing things
10xscjn,,j7vysv5,Exactly! u/Mint_Julius gets it.  Wake the fuck up, kid.
10xscjn,,j82f2gn,Nothing will change until both major political parties are voted out.   Maybe nothing will change  until the voters are replaced with higher quality voters that are less manipulable.   Maybe we should have less voters and out of every 1,000 people should be randomly selected to be a voter and the voters should be paid to get informed because why should voters who‚Äôs votes barely count bother to be sufficiently informed to not be easy to manipulate?
10xscjn,,j85mn36,Or maybe we need radical restructuring of society. Decentralization, and communal ground-up direct democracy instead of bourgeois liberal "representative" democracy
10xscjn,,j7u4774,I didn't feel that. The "muh get a job" is way more common in the working class, they fear so much being homeless than they see their wagie job as an Holy Grail. When people are really rich, the middle class like the working one or the poors poors tend to be the same thing.
10xscjn,,j7u75nj,Sure I get "get a job" from working people, rich folks are too scared of the homeless to even do that. They just lock the doors and avoid looking at you. But I get infinitely more help from working people than I ever have rich folks
10xscjn,,j7uceuh,Yep. I think most working class people have some awareness of how close they are to homelessness, but they deal with it in different ways. It makes some people sympathetic, but it makes others view the homeless as enemies.
10xscjn,,j7ucw3l,Yup. Whereas a lot of rich people just see you as garbage beneath their consideration, or a threat. I never had the cops pull me up for walking through a poor or working class area, but it'll happen in bourgeois neighbourhoods
10xscjn,,j7ugo34,I learned about the fundamental difference between rich and working class people long before I experienced homelessness.   I was in an accident about twenty years ago, and I was in a wheelchair for three or four months. I'd take a bus to physical therapy, but if the weather was nice, I'd roll home in my chair. It was about four and a half miles. I lived in a  neighborhood, but my route took me through an affluent area.  The first time I rolled home, I got to the end of a block and realized that there wasn't a ramp at the corner. It was a long block, and rather than go all the way back to the ramp at the other end, I tried to roll off the curb. I was unsuccessful.  I tipped over and got dumped out of my chair. This happened a block away from a parochial school, and was right when it was letting out. The intersection was a four-way stop, and there was a nonstop stream of cars that came to a stop a few feet away, then proceeded through the intersection. None of them stopped.   I had casts on both legs, and my broken ribs weren't quite healed yet, so I was in a lot of pain. I lay there in the gutter for several minutes before I recovered enough to move. It took me another couple of minutes to climb back into the chair. Meanwhile, the stream of cars continued to roll past.  In my neighborhood, random people would offer to help me cross the street. There was a block with a very steep hill a few blocks from my house that I chose to go up. I could have gotten to the top by another route that spread the slope out over several blocks, but I was all about pushing my limits. Pedestrians would often offer to help me get to the top, and people in cars would frequently pull over and watch to make sure I made it.  I know rich people who have hearts of gold. But many of them (and I think this is more often the case with upper middle class people than with the extremely wealthy) strive to insulate themselves from the gritty reality of how the other half lives.
10xscjn,,j85ksj0,I currently live in a state in the south, and I think the problem is that crime has gotten so bad that people are just scared to help. You worry if it is a set up, or if the person has a gun or something.   I am a small built women, and my heart breaks when I see someone down on there luck, but I have been taught over the years to never under any circumstances approach for my own safety.   People are also worried if they are going to be stollen from or attacked. I used to not pay attention to people who didnt look like they belong, in our neighborhood with multi-mllioon dollar houses. Now that my shed was broken into (and it seemed like whoever was in there was ready to attack if  found, based on what they left in there), and a car has been stolen- I am scared for my safety and the safety of vulnerable family members in my house, and are way more likely to call the cops when I see someone who appears like they do not live in my neighborhood, because I like to live in peace.
10xscjn,,j7xtwxl,I'm seen as sub-human everywhere but that's only because of my face/appearance. I'm afraid to walk around my current upscale area because i can be profiled.
10xscjn,,j7yyasx,Yeah as my years on the road rolled by, and my dirty kid uniform became increasingly patched up and obvious, profiling naturally increased
10xscjn,,j82fjg0,Enemies maybe but still humans.  The way I treat bugs is not kind.
10xscjn,,j7ube4x,Yes, i didn't account the fear factor.
10xscjn,j7u3ju9,,Yes, and there's a HUGE difference between different affluent communities.    Some of them tend to be kinder and more generous, and the law enforcement is more forgiving and lenient.  Others will be hateful, hostile, and the police will show up immediately, even if you're polite and haven't caused any problems.  Some towns you can make like $200 on accident, passing through...    Other places, you get escorted out of town at gunpoint for boiling eggs on a camp stove under a bridge (that happened to me once...)
10xscjn,,j7u3u6j,It happen to me in Oregon. They even put me in a police station for no reason, hopefully i escape, steal a motorcycle and get to the woods.
10xscjn,,j7u416d,Just remember while your out there....they drew first blood.
10xscjn,,j7u55u9,A) seduce the Warden's wife  B) secure a Kawasaki from the outside  C) sedate the guards  D) sex on wheels  E) arrive at forest camp.
10xscjn,,j85l13o,See but this gives you a bad name, when you are planning to steal a motorcycle from someone else
10xscjn,,j82ga4t,Did they let you pack up your camp stove or make you leave the camp stove behind?  A camp stove might take some minutes to cool down and police might be too impatient to wait for the stove to cool down.
10xscjn,,j87ztg4,>Did they let you pack up your camp stove or make you leave the camp stove behind?  I think so, if I remember correctly.  My road dog had one of those tiny 6-8 inch portable camp stoves.... I think he just ditched the boiling eggs and clipped the stove to his bag.
10xscjn,,j85l5m7,I think this has to do with if the community has high crime and associates you as a threat to their safety and peace or not
10xscjn,j7ubb9p,,I was homeless in the South east US. I found more resources and survivability help in a lower income are. The richer area had cops who were completely douchebag assholes. The richer area also had No resources at all.
10xscjn,,j7ubmg3,Yeah the southeast is where I've gotten the most help and kindness, almost exclusively from poor/working folks
10xscjn,,j85la2g,The richer area has no resources, because they want to keep their area exclusive
10xscjn,j7vrb35,,The cops were called on me all the time when I parked in a rich suburb. But my job was there so I didn't have much choice. It seemed everyone thought sleeping in your car is illegal, so they'd dial 911. Number one reason given was that residents were "scared" but I was always in a commercial parking lot so idk what the issue was. Typically the cops would just check in to make sure we were okay and went on their way.   When I worked in a much less affluent area, the only people who called the cops were the ones who were bothered by my dog living in the car with us.  EDIT in the poorer area, we got a lot of spontaneous help in the form of home cooked meals, cases of water, dog food, and one woman even gave us a bunch of body care products she made herself. That was probably the most touching because she just wanted to help but didn't know how. Her soaps were AMAZING.
10xscjn,,j82gztc,Tiburon California in the 1990s would have the police follow and pull over cars that would be normal cars in most places but that were not expensive enough to be in Tiburon. The police were harassing the servants of the wealthy in an effort to make sure the servants were authentic servants rather than poor people coming to see the views.  Tiburon has great views of San Francisco bay but those views are the property of the wealthy and poor people apparently don‚Äôt deserve to see nice views.  I was allowed into Tiburon because I was their taxi driver taking the real people to the airport.  The police were allowed in to protect the rich but the police were also not wealthy enough to be one of the real people.  Wealthy Sausalito 5 miles from Tiburon had a different kinder culture from Tiburon but also had great views of the Bay.  Contempt for the common man was common in Tiburon but not common in Sausalito. Both towns are rich. Both towns think they are liberal and vote for Democrats but they are different.
10xscjn,j7uxtz5,,Might as well go to middle class and lower class neighborhoods if you're looking for words of encouragement. Wealthier people are quicker to call the cops and say "get a job, scum." Happened to me a few times
10xscjn,j7xq3tr,,Where i am now. I've gone from low tier overpriced overpopulated overdeveloped rapidly deteriorating area to a very expensive place. Same kind of disgusting concrete jungle environment but a lot more expensive because wealthier population. Fewer apartment buildings, mostly home owners. In my former area people walked outside a lot. People walked their pets. Were generally friendly, said hello, rarely had a small talk. Average old overpriced shitbox that nobody normal would buy is $500k. New area is dead quiet. Nobody says hello. Very few walkers. After dark streets are dead quiet and darker, even though the area is safer. Average shitbox is +/- $1 million. I walked around for a bit nobody talks, nobody greets. All keep to themselves. I don't feel comfortable asking churches and businesses for overnight parking spot. I called every post office in the area asked for general delivery or po box for homeless service. They don't participate. Nobody ever asked before. This area i'm currently in doesn't know homelessness. There's probably never been a homeless person in the history of this area. Even when i go to grocery stores, in my former area i could have a small talk. Now nobody even talks. I don't feel comfortable. Without money and status i'm going to have a very bad time everywhere but especially in my current area. People here have no empathy or compassion. Homelessness is definitely criminalized or at least i feel like it here. I don't even want to have an encounter with cops. It's a police town/state. They milk the public worse than in my former area. I have other reasons why i don't belong in my current area but they are unrelated to homelessness or my low status. It's not much different from my previous area but the rich population is generally worse.
10xscjn,j7ulq7s,,Depends on where you live. People here are highly conservative politically so if they see any homeless they are disgusted and tell them to get a job and say how lazy, etc. I‚Äôm currently living in an RV that barely works so no running water or anything. It‚Äôs just a hard shelter at this point and it‚Äôs freezing out so I can‚Äôt always wash my clothes, I try to make myself look presentable. They‚Äôre so incredibly rude to me and treat me like trash not only because I don‚Äôt dress nice but because I‚Äôm young. However dumpster diving is easy in a few places here but others they soil the food they throw out or lock the dumpsters
10xscjn,,j7vk3fc,>but others they soil the food they throw out or lock the dumpsters  seriously, FUCK THOSE PEOPLE.   They ought to do the world a favor and throw themselves into the trash where they belong and leave their undeserved discarded food for someone with human values and good moral integrity.
10xscjn,,j7vn4o4,Seriously! I never understood that because would they really rather it go to waste and sit at a waste plant than people actually feed themselves??? It‚Äôs disgusting
10xscjn,,j7vorhm,It is disgusting. People like that are generally not happy and live with a lot of fear.  Pity them.
10xscjn,,j7vn9dg,Also even worse a store I worked for my old manager would dump bleach or a cleaning chemical on food he was throwing out
10xscjn,,j7vp1oy,Because that's what Jesus would do, right?  Fucking Christ.
10xscjn,j7wdj17,,Aren‚Äôt there more cops with more free time for driving the homeless out of town in a rich town?  Don‚Äôt the homeless stick out more and blend less in a rich town?  Don‚Äôt rich people always call the cops because in a rich town the cops will show up when you call them?  Aren‚Äôt rich people more scared of the homeless?  On the other hand rich towns have more green space to hide in.  Maybe the OP got lucky and found an extra nice rich town.
10xscjn,,j7yypli,I've known a *lot* of homeless (and particularly travelers who have a wide range of areas they've experienced) over 10 years on the road, and I don't think I've ever heard a single person say they found rich people to be nicer/better/more helpful, and rich neighborhoods less likely to illicit police encounters
10xscjn,j7vcdr3,,Yes
10xscjn,j7wg65b,,It's sad to admire a nice area and to be treated like dirt because I have less.
10xl0zt,j7toudr,,I am sorry that you are going through that OP. I might be right behind you with homelessness with this economy. I genuinely hope that it gets better for you.   Life is difficult because we cannot control the difficulty setting.
10xl0zt,j7t472j,,As a joke, I used to tell people, "Homelessness builds character." I don't even know what means. I suppose it says something about your ability to survive on the streets.   Shelters suck. They weren't for me anyway because I snore, and the other men complained. Having a car or van to sleep in is the move, and something I recommend.   I suppose hitchhiking is frowned upon by authorities. It's something I never did because I somehow managed to always have a car even as they were used and cheap.   When my Cirrus died in Nashville, a worker at a gas station mart gave me a Sentra for free! How rare was that? It only lasted about a year after I drove it to, and around, Seattle, but still. There are good people out there.
10xl0zt,,j7wdbbw,I snore too. Definitely worried about this, but it is what it is. Crazy generous to get that sentra! Hope you're doing well.
10xl0zt,j7vhoaz,,Dm if you need someone to talk to
10xl0zt,j7w79xj,,If you avoid the big cities you avoid most of the problems you can have while being homeless. Your situation depend of how much money you have. A lot of time hitchhiking can be a way to meet people and founding work along the way, especially in rural areas. You don't have that much fear to have. I spend years in the constant anxiety of losing the places where I lived, having no money, etc. But honestly it's like the fear of the water for someone who never swim, at first it's cold and new, you just have to learn and then it can be amazing. The anxiety just go away.
10xl0zt,,j7wdxsn,I wouldn't be too scared, but I'm worried that while hitchhiking I'll end up arrested and then not be able to join the army for something stupid. If I can't join the army then I'm in the homeless life for good. I can see myself getting used to it while I'm trying to get back on my feet, but starting this new adventure has my nerves completely shot. Thanks for the reply though! Each reply I read makes me feel a little bit better
10xl0zt,,j7wejcj,Honestly just talking to the cops about your goals, and being a newbie is enough to make them not wanted to bother you. You never gonna have a record for hitchiking. Worse case scenario they gonna tell you don't do that here for your own safety.

Sometimes too tough.   Hard times.
10xkh9c,,j7t8tpo,Yeah a few good flashlights, gotta have back ups. Zero below sleeping bag, sleeping pad, light sleeping bag for summer. I got a two room tent, ropes,fire starters, a couple of water purification bottles and some tablets. Some good knives and a small machete. That's what I can think of now. It's so ridiculous. How am I going to even carry all that now?
10xkh9c,,j7utogf,Maybe a medical kit just incase and some paracetamol
10xkh9c,,j7utqzy,Good idea!
10xkh9c,j7uh9u5,,You should talk to your doctor about these feelings, maybe they can refer you to a therapist or prescribe some anti anxiety medication. I have really bad anxiety and I was against medication at first but once I got the right meds and dosage it helps a *lot.*
10xkh9c,,j7up0po,You're right I should. I used to take anxiety meds and probably do need them again. Thanks!
10xkh9c,,j7utp2q,Yes you need to see a DR quick about your stress and anxiety, if you are only focusing on becoming homeless its going to make you spiral. Take into account of where you are right now and how to prevent being homeless if possible.
10xkh9c,,j7utwdy,Thank you, I'm going to call the Dr today.
10xkh9c,j7utdqc,, Maybe slow down on ordering items online, if you need that money for housing. Do you have a car? If so prepare it for living in, are you working right now?
10xkh9c,,j7utlvt,I know. That's the problem, I'm spending money I don't need to because my anxiety about it is out of control. No I don't have a car, but I do get disability.
10xkh9c,,j7v1190,Physically remove yourself from whatever site you are buying from.   Put up your bankcard stay offline , clean , take a walk, cook listen to music   quit buying
10xkh9c,,j7w14mm,All good advice. Thanks
10xkh9c,j7vitcp,,Thank you for being transparent. Your feelings are valid. Anyone that goes through that kind of cycle, repeatedly, is bound to believe that's how their life will remain. It makes sense to feel anxious about your current living situation and what could possibly happen, especially, after you've dealt with homelessness on and off for so long.  But the anxiety can rob you of the joy that you could have  from simply having a place to stay. Although, we don't know what the future holds but all we can do is hope for the best and live in the NOW. Enjoy what you have now. Don't worry so much about the future, especially about the things you can't really control. Of course it's okay to take preventative measures to avoid being homeless again but letting that fear rule over your mind can take away the precious time you could spend with yourself (and others) in your place of dwelling. With the economy the way how it is now, nothing is guaranteed to be stable.  You don't want so much time to pass you by and you never got to enjoy what you have now. It's something that you might regret because you could have created a memorable life experience.  I know your pain. I wish I can help more.  It's a blessing to have a roof over your head. It's a gift from God. üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüåà

10xfve7,,j7tee7m,Ok so what I‚Äôm working on is for people like yourself. I want to buy a ranch and raise my family but I want the property to also be a travers rest stop and safe space for people to get back on their feet. Not a shelter. Almost a camp of sorts. I want a camp ground style area for people to park or pitch a tent in, gardens, orchards. I want to have the tools available for people to do work themselves, a mechanic that lives on property, artist shop. I want to cover overhead with amazing food. We‚Äôll need to drive a truck into town for street fairs and farmers markets.   I‚Äôm close! So close! I can‚Äôt offer anything yet but if that‚Äôs SD in your photo it‚Äôll be in SoCal. You‚Äôll still be close to the family you do still like.  I value the experience that comes with age. You are valuable and have a purpose. Keep up the fight and keep looking for different options till you find one that fits.   Always have a general info business card, just name and phone number. Offer to do any job you know how to. Gardening, spray paint curbs, wash windows. Anything you hear or see someone might need. You could even go door to door, you‚Äôll get a lot of nos but with the right ‚Äúdown on my luck, just need some honest work‚Äù story you should get a few bites.   You can try churches too. Just ask if you can do any odd jobs to make a few bucks. If nothing else they‚Äôll probably feed you. Take the help, ignore the crazy.   Also look into independent contractors. My father was always looking for hard working reliable workers.   Have you applied for state assistance?   I‚Äôm sorry things feel hopeless right now. Stay strong ü§ôüèª

I can set outside a home depot with my truck and ladder and I charge $100 to drive to someones house and work 2 hours.

10xfve7,,j7ss4jq,The nice thing about inflation and wage slaves and rich connected contractors is it leaves a lot of room for poor humble guys to help little old ladies on fixed incomes. Everyone is happy and The Man loses.
10xfve7,,j7ss8pp,I subscribe to that. But the ladder work usually gets people freaked out.
10xfve7,,j7z75nd,No it doesn't.  Most people's home owners policy covers things like this too.  Insurance is the ultimate scam, so of you as the worker are comfortable, that's all that matters.  Simple ladder work for cleaning gutters is not inherently dangerous.  Your on an 8 foot a frame ladder most likely, amd that fall bruises the ego at best.

Then, go to every job fair/hiring event in San Diego coming up. Make sure to have enough copies of your resume and cover letter for each interview. There‚Äôs a [food and beverage hiring fair](FOOD AND BEVERAGE HIRING FAIR- 2/10/2023 https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appshareios&jk=49b17ad298abfe14) happening in San Diego at the Coaster Terrace from 10AM-4PM on Friday February 10 (tomorrow). Make sure to put your resume and cover letter into a folder (it can be a leap paper folder, but just make sure it‚Äôs one that will protect your resume and cover letter). There‚Äôs also a [Bus Driver hiring event happening in San Diego.](Bus Driver Hiring Event https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appshareios&jk=76d4cca6d8551d94)   I would go to Indeed and type in ‚Äújob fair‚Äù and then ‚ÄúSan Diego, CA‚Äù everyday and sort the ‚Äúdate posted‚Äù for ‚Äúlast 24 hours‚Äù to see if there are any new ones.

If you apply to the ones just listed first, your resume will have a higher chance of being looked at. Also, I would copy and paste the job description or entire job post to ChatGPT with t your resume and ask it to write a resume and cover letter tailored to that job. Your chances will increase dramatically.   Submit your general resume and cover letter to places like Indeed, Monster, SimplyHired, ZipRecruiter, etc. and also sign up for LinkedIn if you haven‚Äôt already. If you have a decent work shirt, have someone take a picture of you somewhere (maybe ask a librarian if you are in a library to help you) take a decent picture to post to LinkedIn, you will get significantly more traction with a picture. Search for any entry level job hiring in San Diego and try connecting with people in HR and also managers of that company and send a message asking questions about the open position to them.

How many times have you contacted them, and what has been their response?  Your mother says you need to be out, and one of the reasons she falls back on, is that you aren't on the lease.  Why not?  In another comment, you state that you currently have a job, but that it doesn't pay enough to cover any of the places you could rent that are around you.  Why aren't you paying as much as you can to your mother, in exchange for her having you on the lease?  I mean, it is possible, especially these days, for landlords to be very strict, so that they will charge more for additional people living in an apartment.. and I could see the rent increase being more than you could afford, if everything was made official.  Still... no info as to why you aren't on the lease now.  Another person here asked if you have a car, and you avoided answering that question.  ***Do you have a car?***  If you do, is there a reason why you aren't living in it, or won't consider living in it?  If you do not have a car, you can likely purchase some beater with even the meager funds you pull in at your current job.  No, you won't be shopping for the car at any used car lots... nothing that expensive.  You'll be sifting through Craigslist, walking to all the local welding shops, and boiler shops, and bakeries, etc., looking for old trucks and delivery vans they would consider selling cheap.  You check the bulletin board in the local library.  You ask at the corner garage, or at the towing companies, if they know where you can purchase a car cheap.  You find a local junk yard, or Pick N Pull lot, and see if they have any running vehicles they'd sell for next to nothing.  There are options out there for cheap running vehicles.  And that's a house on wheels when you have nothing else.  As to the current arguing... it takes two to argue.  You are 19.  She technically doesn't owe you housing and support anymore, as you are legally an adult.  So... her house, her rules.  I'm not saying she isn't the kind of person to find a reason to argue about anything.  I'm just saying it isn't an argument, if she is yelling and you are just standing there not responding.  You wouldn't ***call*** that an argument either.  >my mom is just doing it as a way to get rid of me because she doesn't want to deal with me  You are 19.  She shouldn't have to ever "deal" with you ever again.  You and she are both adults.  If she doesn't want to have to have an experience with another adult where she considers it "dealing with someone", she doesn't have to.  It is one of the perks of being an adult.  That, and "dealing" with the consequences of one's actions and decisions.  Having to "deal with someone" is generally a bad and stressful experience.  If you were problematic as a child, whether she created the monster you were, or you did that on your own... she legally had to "deal" with you because you were her CHILD.  You aren't a child anymore... well, your body isn't a child anymore.  So if she is pushing for you to join JobCorps, because living with you is only stress and anger to her... that's completely within her rights.  As bad as that makes you feel, you cannot change her.  You can only change yourself.  You are equally responsible for your relationship with your mother.  People work jobs they hate, to support families they love.  You probably could have played the part of a loving daughter (aka, treated it like a job), at least to keep the peace in the home.  I say it like that, because... again... I'm not discounting the possibility of your mother being impossible to please.  But if you...  *  have a job, and you  * pay her money towards your rent, and you * pay for your own meals (and occasionally cook for her), and you * clean up the place like you are the maid, and you * don't have guests over, or hold parties, and you * regularly ask her what she needs or wants and promptly fill those requests with priority  ... I can't see her wanting to kick you out.  I can see that as a borderline abusive relationship, if not an actual abusive relationship... but I can also see it as a way to maintain a status quo, for you.  Basically going Gray Rock to a Narcissist, since No Contact isn't feasible for the situation.  You obviously wanted out and away from living under her rules once before.  In the time that you lived with relatives, how did you change yourself to fix the issues between you and your mother?  I mean... if you didn't do anything to make progress in "improving", at least by your mother's standards, in the time you were away... you had no reasonable expectation of there being less friction when you moved back.  All this plays a part moving forward.  You have to go... and you have no real ties (from everything you describe) to where you are.  So... go mobile.  Get away from the unhelpful family.  Obtain a vehicle, and drive to a seasonal tourist town.  Why?  You are 19, and female.  Tourist towns see a swell in residence and work while they are "in season"... and then the people and work dry up during the "off season".  In Season, many of these employers offer pay AND housing, in exchange for you being on call or working long schedules.  These are jobs like... selling T-shirts and towels, or selling/renting Ski gear, waitressing, bar tending/backing, working a counter at a deli/bakery/motel, cleaning motel rooms, etc.  You could summer on Cape Cod (Massachusetts), and Winter in Key West (Florida)... making that long drive twice a year, when the local In Season end.  **Chincoteague, VA is only a stone's throw away on the coast, and that's Seasonal Tourist, with fuzzy ponies.**  The point there, is that being 19 and female, you have the greatest chance of walking into ANY of the jobs in these towns.  You fit the profile of what they want between their registers and the tourist's money.  College age girls make up the bulk of the seasonal employees in Provincetown, MA... be it at galleries, bars, shops, restaurants, etc.    There's migrant work.  Use your youth, and go pick vegetables for a month and earn $3000 or more.  Where I am in Imperial County, California, we have a year-long grow season.  There are crops all year long, and there is always a need to pick something.  Get a car, travel the country, go work hard for a few months or a year, and get the cash you feel you need to straighten yourself out.  $5000 for a month and a half picking Sugar Beets in Montana or South Dakota... get paid for camping, working out, and meeting cool people.
10xd8rk,,j7v9aih,You did not have to write all of this. I appreciate your help but this is far too much. You could just summarized it...   I am not soft begging because I am asking for location advice, and I am not asking for funds, shelter, or anything. I am asking for you all to give me advice on what I can use with my current resources.   I've also mentioned that I'm not interested in certain things (e.g. going to the military) because I'm not using that idea right now since I still have choices on my plate. Yet, there are people telling me to do so.   I also mentioned my job background with a job someone offered me to take. I have the choice to not go back there since I was offered nothing but stress and major depression.   For one, I've contacted the counselor who I'm having dealings with in Job Corps LAST WEEK at the latest period. Yesterday, I snapped pictures of the last piece of my information like I was suggested and I'm waiting for my counselor to get back to me.   You do not know my financial situation. I'm staying with my mother, but she also insists that I pay for things myself. I pay for my cards which I can't drop since I must pay them off, my phone bill, my food, and even my own transportation. Mentioned that I don't have a car, so I have to pay to travel to where I must go. I'm also not inclined into giving you all more information than necessary, but since you feel the need...as I stated before, I stayed with my relatives (great grandmother, grandmother, and aunt) for about 5 months last year after I had graduated high school, on June 7th, 2022. My mother had to look for a new place, and so, after about two months, she found one. Since I told her I wasn't coming back home, I wasn't added to the lease, and my mom did not seek out a bigger home to accommodate me in case I come back home.   I also mentioned that I don't have a car. üòê I said in the comments in response to another person that I do not have a car, nor do I have anyone I'm close with who drives, or has a home I can crash at, since I've never talked to people at all whenever I go to school, work, or even neighbors. I don't have the money NOR do I have a license to go rent, borrow, or anything. My job does not pay me well enough and I haven't had a chance to save. Sore excuses, I know, I apologize, but that goes back to the above statement that I have to pay for my own things since no one but my mom helps me when I really need it.   And I know that it takes two to argue but...please don't critic my at home life. You don't know how it is with us and how it is when I was growing up. My mom picks arguments and as I said, she insists on telling me that I need to leave day to day, whenever she asks me what am I doing, I tell her, she starts shouting at me about. I didn't give you the full details, so you don't know what's up.   Thats all the information I can give. I hope you understand better.
10xd8rk,j7rusax,,Find the nearest Amazon warehouse and apply there. They have free bachelor degrees after 90 days of employment and it pays ok. Rent a room in someone‚Äôs house or use roomies.com to find a roommate. If you have any questions just ask, I currently work at Amazon and support myself on it.
10xd8rk,,j7rzdfx,I have a job and I already worked at Amazon. I sucked, I was there for nearly a year. I got fired for clocking out on my phone while exiting the building, and they categorized it as stealing time. I don't have the money to rent rooms right now. The areas around me go for unnecessarily high prices. I have no one to ask. I have no family but my mother and my siblings who all live with my mom.
10xd8rk,,j7sicn4,Wow, Amazon really sucks.  I took a bus to Lake Tahoe for a summer to find work.  I was hired and started the next day as a maid at a casino.  It didn't pay great, but while I was in line applying, I met some people, and we shared a place for the summer.  What kind of work do you want to do?  I really hope you catch or create a break and everything works out for you.
10xd8rk,,j7up66s,Thanks so much for sharing! I didn't think of that. I always saw advertisements for the casino and never thought to work there.   Also thanks for your concern. I currently work in retail.
10xd8rk,,j7tzyrv,Legally it's not stealing time... you have an LNI claim against amazon. Legally they have to pay you for as long as you're within the building it is your right to clock out right before you go to the door.

10xd8rk,j7y9t9e,,After reading the topic, best choice I can recommend is to join the military (even though you said you don‚Äôt want to , it‚Äôs pretty much the best solution for someone in your current situation). I understand feeling anxious about joining but it‚Äôs really not that bad at all , military is easy but don‚Äôt choose a combat job. I was in a similar situation as you during my younger years and joining the military was one of the best decisions I ever made in my life, saved me from a life of homelessness/severe depression.
10xd8rk,,j7zoi1s,Thanks for sharing your experience. If I join, do you know what comes first? I was thinking of joining the navy, but I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm not smart enough for that, LOL, so that aside, what are the protocols needed when attending or what are things I should know?
10xd8rk,,j7zt120,Don‚Äôt say that , you‚Äôre smart enough , armed forces is full of dumbasses , you‚Äôll be fine. Just study a bit before taking the ASVAB, be in decent shape and you‚Äôll be good.
10xd8rk,j7uygj2,,The military is your best option. I'm researching resources in your area. Hold on...
10xd8rk,,j7uz4bd,Baltimore County looks like a nightmare. Their services for homeless people are probably overwhelmed. I would seriously consider moving to a less populated area. Hold on...
10xd8rk,j7vuvr9,,This is something you'll want to consider when you start school, but I'm still searching for something to help right now.    There's a tuition waiver program for homeless youths in Maryland between the age of 15 to 25?  https://mhec.maryland.gov/preparing/Pages/FinancialAid/ProgramDescriptions/prog_homelessyouth.aspx  Tuition Waiver for Homeless Youth
10xd8rk,j7xmzwl,,Why is this situation with so-called 'families' so common? I was in a similar situation with living with my 'Mother'. Constantly violated my boundaries, threw some of my stuff away that was valuable, simply wouldn't be reasonable with sharing the bills and housework. I suspect she was poisoning my food as well because I had never experienced so many stomach cramps in my life before I was living there. She was an alcoholic so there were other antics as well.  I've since learnt to only rely on myself, and that means learning to survive whatever means might be necessary. ATM I sleep in a hammock in the woods. It's not much but it's safe and comfortable. The best advice I can give is to prepare yourself for homelessness as much as you can in advance. It takes a lot of the anxiety and confusion away when it does happen.
10xd8rk,,j7xpm9z,I'm so sorry you went through this. I know it was tough to live with someone who you deem as a parent to do something as vile as what you mentioned. I'm glad you found some way to sustain yourself though. Although this situation is mentally exhausting for me, I'm also doing what I can in my own way. Thanks for sharing your story.
10xd8rk,,j7xw0ec,Thank you MP, I really appreciate having the community here as support. It's a real kick in the guts when the 'family' that brought you into the world fail to raise you properly and then abandon you.  I know your young and female and homelessness can be much more daunting, I hope there are more options for you out there in the way of shelters. Like people on here have already said, there are a lot more rooming options available for females. Maybe you can look after a nice old lady that needs a hand around the house in exchange for accommodation? Maybe put an ad in the newspaper?
10xd8rk,j7s1dtq,,A shelter is a good place to start they help you find housing too
10xd8rk,j7tab8s,,The military is not a terrible choice...apply at fast food..chikfila....grocery stores..post locally on FB to ee who is hiring. Work full time if you can or work 2 part time jobs....work your way up to something a little better each time..then you can rent a room.....
10xd8rk,j7uoszb,,Join the military
10xd8rk,,j7uov5i,I won't...but thanks anyway.
10xd8rk,,j7up1br,Why not? The best opportunity there is. It took me out of homelessness and poverty
10xd8rk,j7rr70a,,Do you work right now?
10xd8rk,,j7rrryh,Yes, I'm actively working

10xd8rk,,j7vquzz,Hi, I'm saving that for last on my list because I'm still working with job corps and I'm also trying to get into a shelter. I'll consider it soon though, but if I'm gonna be honest with you, it's making me anxious to join üò≠ still considering tho
10xd8rk,j7wq5cj,,So what are you doing to piss mom off? There must be something she's not too happy about.  Alot of construction and highway jobs have travel and paid expenses like hotel  and food  expenses. Look for something like that. Also homeless shelters are not as bad as they sound and usually assign a case worker to help you out. Don't give up though.  You said you had no where to live ,yet you still live with mom. Ask her to sit down and have a heart to heart .....you may find that she just wants certain obligations from you ....like helping out with chores , among other things. I mean you're not a little kid anymore.
10xd8rk,,j7x8pkf,I mean of course, but I help out. My mom just doesn't like my "default personality" because I'm super depressive. I try to be mindful about it because I know how sensitive she is since she's also going through things, but it just happens. Like sometimes my youngest brother would think that I'm mad when I'm not, I'm either just thinking or that's my normal face.   But yeah, that aside, you might be right. We sat down and talked a lot of times. Sometimes she doesn't know how to not be mean though, so it makes it hard to sit still and listen. But many times besides that, she actually tries to help me and give me suggestions. She was the one who helped me find a new job when I lost mine at Amazon in December, and she was also the one who put me on to Job corps. Even now, she's still helping. I asked for some shelters, she sent me three (of which I was turned away from), so she's helping me as well.
10xd8rk,,j81l3fu,Good communication is key! And if she can't or won't....then it's probably time to go. Look for a cheap room to rent like on craigslist or even face book....but always remember,if you have a job and a paycheck coming you always have hope! Good luck my man!
10xd8rk,j81m4id,,Hi everyone! Update:   - I've been listening and reading your suggestions carefully. I would like to point out that my job pays the state average ($12.75) and I'd have to save up a couple of checks to rent since I work part-time at a retail job. I'm looking into rooms for rent, the prices are pretty scary. If push comes to shove, I'll look into Baltimore city for some rooms to rent since they typically run from $300 - $700 per week, I think.    - I applied to food stamps about 2 weeks before. And I JUST got the letter today and got approved. My mom gets food stamps, but she doesn't oike me using them, so she'd restrict me unless I truly needed something. Don't call her out on this, she has 3 other children besides me, plus herself and my oldest sister living here. She only gets about $250 because my sister and brother's incomes are overriding her benefits. So I don't blame her for being frugal.     - I have no car, but someone informed that they did what they had to do and sleep in a hammock in the woods. Mad props to them, it also changed my prospective since I didn't know without realizing it, but I was thinking of my own comfort. Meaning I didn't think of going to a homeless shelter, just thought of ones for women that accommodate you.         - I've been told about contacting my counselor at job corps. Called her, she didn't answer, so I sent an email and I'm planning to contact her again on Monday since today is Friday, and it's pretty late.          - My mother and I briefly talked about my situation and I told her that if I don't have a decision ready for me, then I'll just join the military. I'm anxious about that since I'm not confident in my mental and physical capabilities. But that'll be what I'll try if I have to.    - Also, if I seem like I was shutting you down, I mean no harm. The way I text is "blunt" because I don't think of it like an email. Sorry about that, your advice was helpful.   Thanks to eveyone who sent me some worthwhile information üôèüèæ I appreciate it A LOT I asked my local city subreddit, for places to call, and you guys for help on what my next steps should be. Please wish me luck, trying to keep myself in tact and move forward. Bless u all.

10xd8rk,,j85mszx,Take the ACT, start the applications, and by August you might be living in a college dorm working towards a degree. No one gets immediate estable housing solutions in this country, it all starts with an application process. That‚Äôs the sad reality.
10xd8rk,,j85otvq,I'll do so üëçüèæ I was more worried about the prices since I feel reluctant by taking out a student loan, but my future is more important and nothing comes free.
10xd8rk,,j85qlbm,Public schools are less expensive obviously, you could research around and take the least amount of loans (not private btw,) and study a major with the highest value, so when you‚Äôre done you don‚Äôt have to struggle with paying them back.
10xctf7,j7tasig,,You should get a drivers license. No cons at all....its an acceptable form of ID....you may need to drive some day ....not having a license limits employment possibilities.
10xctf7,j7v5e56,,Depends. Where do you live?  American society is designed around the automobile and the people who drive them. Not having a car automatically puts you in a class deemed undesirable.   Not so bad if you live in a place with decent public transit, but you'll still be judged.  I gave up my license because my state requires you to have car insurance to possess a license, even if you don't have a car. That was a bad decision but I couldn't afford it.
10xctf7,j7rnpw6,,It‚Äôs a skill to learn. It‚Äôs for your benefit only. Other then not driving I don‚Äôt see a reason it‚Äôs especially needed. My friend who lives in the city didn‚Äôt get his till early 30s.   You can use a variety of other IDs. However, license is the most common and therefore easiest to be given if you are checking them.
10xctf7,j7vsva0,,a State ID or passport are both valid forms of ID, driver's license is only useful if you have a vehicle.  many states require that you take a driver's education class first, before the actual test, so that's even more $$$.
10x70h0,j7rilk1,,A woman at the shelter I was in had stayed at a shelter for pregnant women. She transferred to my shelter a few months after she gave birth. She said it was a positive experience for the most part. She shared a room with another woman. They took her to doctor's appointments, made sure she got good prenatal care, offered parenting and nutrition classes, and connected her to resources that could help her after the baby was born. She said the only downside was the heavy emphasis on religion. I think the name of the shelter is Bella House.
10x70h0,j7sy8ob,,OK, people, back off. This woman didn't ask for our opinions on her pregnancy. Stop telling her what to do.  For the record, I'm rabidly pro-choice. I've marched for abortion rights. I've escorted women seeking abortions through angry crowds. I donate money to the Lilith Fund, which pays for travel and hotel expenses for women needing abortions.   This woman is why I'm fighting. All women should have a choice. I may not agree with hers, but I will fight to the death for her right to make it. We don't know her full situation and we don't know her or what moved her to make the decision she did. And we don't need to know to answer her question. Don't dump your baggage on her.   I'm off my soapbox now ...
10x70h0,,j7u3t92,This is a good comment.  You're a good person.   I'm not sure where this is but my first action after securing shelter would be figuring out of if it's even legal to kick you out for it.  I know in Canada at the very least it's illegal to discriminate based on familial status (which a child counts as, unsurprisingly), and i do seem to recall the US having a similar law.   Other countries i cannot speak to at all.   Either way,  anyone who kicks someone out for having a child is so far below garbage it's poisoning the groundwater.   I hope things start looking up for both their hypothetical future's sake

10x1uzd,j7sllzw,,If the government got out of the way, non profits and even just individuals and homeless people themselves could build housing for every one.   I have a backyard and would be happy to have  one or two shed-shelters in it where people can have a bed to sleep warm and a place to lock their belongings so they can build their lives back.  If the government wouldn't call that illegal I could partner with a non-profit to build and manage those, or just do it myself, or even let a homeless individual do it themselves starting with a tent and upgrading it to a cabin in time.   But the government will shut it down right now.     Similarly non-profits would build SRO's I'd they were allowed but they can't.    So the line that it's not tax payers responsibility to build shelter for folks who can't pay for it is a red herring, we have more than enough non-profit money to build the shelters but a government mostly driven by NIMBYS who make it illegal to do so.

And in turn humanity has the responsibility to take care of the young, old, sick and poor, and those who are struggling.  Otherwise, well, there is no humanity.  Or maybe it's already lost.....

10x1uzd,,j7uf8qi,They have the right to a tent they can set up
10x1uzd,,j7wlf48,Because we live in a modern society, that's why. If you want to go back to the stone age then we can all live in caves and use fires instead of ovens.
10x1uzd,,j7sghdc,Lost your right to a home?
10x1uzd,,j7slh88,Well, yeah. I mean I lost my job, lost my home, what gives me the right to a house? Like..who‚Äôs gonna give me something for nothing? It‚Äôs a nice concept, sure. But in reality?
10x1uzd,,j7sm3dx,I definitely don't have all the answers but are you against housing programs? What if someone loses their job due to disability and disability pay is 941? Nationwide there are very few places one could afford rent in that amount.
10x1uzd,,j7vtxm1,it's farming for karma.  go to any sub & create a low effort post about the thing the sub is about & you'll get massive updoots.  in response to your question, it isn't a right.  there aren't any "rights", except those that any country enshrines for their citizens, and those are only valid in that country.  'might makes right' is the only true right that exists
10x1uzd,j7qozba,,It's great if someone wants to use their own personal resources to house someone, go for it. But for one person to steal money from someone else (taxpayers) and use that to house someone, that's wrong imo. Theft is wrong even if the intent is to do good with the money.
10x1uzd,,j7r0y5r,Are we stealing from the tax payers when we provide a child with an education? Are we stealing when we house abused women? What is the difference?
10x1uzd,,j7s1qzd,Educating children is an investment in society. Sheltering victim of abuse is caring for community. Using tax dollars to reinforce self harm is neither caring for community or an investment. If someone is consistently making bad decisions, they most likely need more than just shelter to truly get better it will probably include limits on their freedom. It's the sad truth, but if you are making bad life choices, other ppl shouldn't have to pay for those choices unless those that are paying get to dictate the terms of payment. Otherwise, the individual will continue to make bad choices whether housed or not...
10x1uzd,,j7ugr2u,Exactly. Taxes should benefit 100% of society. For instance, roads benefit literally every citizen. EVEN if you don't drive. The shit you buy gets delivered on a road/highway, in order for society to do their job. They need a road to get to the places they work. So roads literally benefit everyone who pays taxes. Does a homeless guy getting a free house benefit me? He gets the house and then what? Will he sober up, get educated and become a doctor? Scientist? Will he solve a future diseases i may be infected with in the future and save my life? Or will he just get a free house and literally offer nothing to society. Just existing for the sake of existing because bleeding hearts don't want to see him in the rain. Meanwhile I'm working 70 hours a week, paying for everything i need.
10x1uzd,,j7sv5zm,If you look at what any city spends on emergency services, you would see that your logic is flawed.  Not only is it cheaper to house people (even those that you deem "unworthy"), it is also cheaper to house them and pay a case manager to help them learn how to live in a home.
10x1uzd,,j7szo9r,Did you read the post you responded to?
10x1uzd,,j7v45fr,Yes. I even read it again just now. Shall I add more commentary for your benefit? Okay, sure:  The value system that you're proposing there at the end, which is essentially to determine "who is worthy for services, and who isn't", is red herring in this argument. Indicating that "people shouldn't have to pay" is a red herring, also.  You're going to pay. Whether they build homes with that money, or drive addicts to the hospital in an ambulance multiple times a week, or incarcerate, has no bearing on this fact. You're going to pay those taxes either way.  Since that's the fact here, the imaginary process that you have for determining which human beings qualify for the resources in question (and who doesn't) is not only meaningless, it is supremely unhelpful.  Do you want to help? Here's what you do:  Lead, follow, or get out of the way.
10x1uzd,,j7vhkoe,I like the idiocracy quote. I agree, the price is the price and will always be paid. My point is that housing is not enough. If society has to front the cost then the state should really become the individuals sponsor or the person should become a ward of the state. This means the state truly takes responsibility for the individual and will most likely have the right to limit freedoms.   I understand holding ppl responsible for their actions is uncomfortable bc the implication is that they are at fault. I think you just need to get past that and realize that whatever the reason is there are some people that will never be able to function as fully developed adults without help from the community and that help isn't physical as much as it is mental. Housing is not enough, we need to really address the deep seated mental issues.  Im advocating that we help everyone but not just a half measure. We need to take fully heal ppl, save these ppl from their own self-harm by actually and the harm that they are doing to society.  Your previous post suggests that I am implying limiting housing or resources. In fact I am saying we need to shove resources down ppls throats whether they like it or not. Otherwise these resources will be squandered by the same bad behavior.
10x1uzd,,j7vp8jd,Your plan is about to be implemented in California. They're passing legislation to essentially force everyone either accept homeless resources, or be institutionalized.   The problem with that, is that you do not heal anyone by causing more trauma. Removing autonomy does exactly that, it adds to the mountain of trauma that they already have. It's cements resentment towards the institutions the interact with these traumatized people like simple machines.  I have case managed chronically homeless people for 8 years, and many of the people that we house have embraced their apartments. But not all.   But the longer you work with somebody, in a respectful manner, the more they begin to display healthy boundaries with other people. The more they begin showing respect for where they live, and respect for their neighbors. Sometimes they have to get kicked out once or twice to catch on, but that is simply trauma information.  If you're authentically interested in treating trauma and healing people, you don't use force. You begin with a holistic approach that heals them with every step.   Meaning that you house them first.
10x1uzd,,j7wfvtj,Many of those people cannot handle autonomy and should not have it.  Traumatic it may be, but not worse then the trauma of living a terrible, humiliating existence on the streets.
10x1uzd,,j7x3uhw,Yes, I've heard that some women should not have autonomy either. Because they "can't handle it".  So of course the logic follows: "As traumatic as not having autonomous rights to your own body may be, it's not as traumatic as allowing the terrible, humiliating experience known as abortion."  You sound like my Mormon relatives.
10x1uzd,,j7vu7v0,Thanks for the perspective.
10x1uzd,,j7wfdkh,It‚Äôs not just the initial cost of the housing, it‚Äôs the indefinite, possibly lifelong expenses for that one person-utilities, home repairs, yard maintenance, etc etc and depending on the persons age, could be in the millions, for a person that contributes nothing to society. It‚Äôs not an investment.
10x1uzd,,j7x396m,The only reason that you think they have nothing to contribute is because you don't talk to them. You're ethic on display here is adjacent to eugenics.   These human beings, despite their trauma, have just as much power to heal and thrive as you do. Just because you lack the vision and the ability to unlock it doesn't mean that you are correct. All it means is that you are ignorant about a large swath of your own population.
10x1uzd,,j7xrcvj,Yes I know, I was one of them. I was able to come back from it, despite the trauma. And the time that I was like that I was not contributing to society. Some people are not contributing that‚Äôs just a fact.
10x1uzd,,j7y8p6i,I don't care if they're not contributing in a way that you deem valuable. People learn lessons and  grow over time, even if it isn't at a clip you would prefer.  I also don't care if you mistakenly deemed yourself to have "no value" at some low point in your life. Things that were "facts" back in the day are seen in a different light down the road with experience and understanding.  Every human being should be housed. If we're spending the $ anyway, then housing at least provides an opportunity to come out of the cold.
10x1uzd,,j7sgcic,Its still taking money and none are my kids.                        When did this become a right wing libertarian "we shouldn't help anyone" sub?
10x1uzd,,j7smovp,Those kids depending on how educated and thus productive they are will pay taxes which will be used for social services.
10x1uzd,,j7tacb4,I agree that most likely they will need **more** than just shelter. But everyone absolutely needs shelter. That's a basic human need, and if you don't have your basic needs met, you aren't going to be able to get your life back on track.
10x1uzd,,j7s5jdf,I understand where you are coming from, but how do you know everyone on the street is making bad decisions? I think if we can get those off the streets who don't want to be there, then that would be a vast improvement.  Also, addiction is a disease, and sadly it can't be conquered until basic needs are met. Addiction is a part of mental health. We house, clothe, and feed those in prison who have committed crimes, and we should do that. Why is it unheard of to house someone down on their luck or who has made bad decisions?  We already clothe, feed and temporarily house these people, why not take the next step, and give them something a little more permanent? Maybe 4-6 months? Their own room, their own bathroom, and a shared kitchen and living space? Give them time to lick their wounds, give them some chores, and mental health, maybe eventually transfer them to community services and subsidized housing, job training, etc?  Would it be any more expensive than what we do now with them? Clog up our healthcare systems, clog up our paramedics with overdose calls, feed them, clothe them, and give them nightly shelters? We have all these empty office buildings. Each office could be a bedroom with a lock. There could be a shared kitchen, and laundry room on every floor. I agree there should be some rules. IF they can't follow them, they get 2 chances then they get kicked out and someone else can take their place.
10x1uzd,,j7safmt,Sorry, I though the premise was the individual was on the street bc of their decisions. I must have misunderstood.  I actually think we are aligned. I wouldn't go as far as prison. This seems extreme. But I do think something similar is needed. Just housing is a half measure. You really need to control the individual until they are able to be functioning otherwise all you have is someone who may hurt those around him. Taking money from the public to create a public health risk for both the individual who needs shelter and those who have now become this person's neighbor is not the solution. You need full on rehabilitation services.
10x1uzd,,j7ss0nq,I don't think they should go to prison either. I was just pointing out that we feed and house criminals who have also made bad decisions.
10x1uzd,,j7uhrqx,Completely different, dude to  morals, when we put people into they're prison. They are pretty much state property until their sentence is up. This means due to avoiding being inhumane, we have to shelter them, and provide 3 meals a day. Not because anybody wants to give free stuff to a serial killer. But if the government is going to punish you, they are going to do it humanly while respecting your rights. I mean, if the homeless want a free bed, medical and food. They can commit a crime.
10x1uzd,,j7uxd61,Yeah... Aren't we encouraging homeless people to commit crimes?
10x1uzd,,j805too,Have we looked into the living standards/humane treatment of those incarcerated (housing, meals,clothing, treatment, hygiene etc.)?  It‚Äôs likely not what most people are thinking or at least, I feel sure this to be the case.  It‚Äôll vary drastically mind the Local, State, whether the facility is government, private and how many services are contracted out‚Ä¶also take into consideration there will be an amount of corruption involved. It‚Äôs why advocacy groups exist and will continue to.
10x1uzd,,j7r1pf6,Yes, in a perfect world, only people who use a government service would fund that government service. So parents with children would receive a bill for school, and women who are abused would seek shelter with friends or family, or at churches or private charities. Theft is wrong.
10x1uzd,,j7r3hlr,lol.  I don't have any children, but I benefit when children are educated as do you. We all do. We have already lived in a society where "charity" was the world's safety net, and that did not work out so well. Governments do it better than charities and churches and history has proven this. \*shrug\* Right now we have people using the food bank and that charity can't keep up with the demand. THis is why charities are a terrible social safety net. If you are a Christian,  yes Jesus said to give to charity and not the government, but in Jesus's time the government was terribly corrupt. So those rules do not apply. CHarities are good, but they should supplement government safety nets, not be our social safety net.  What Jesus said to do was to take care of the downtrodden. Since governments were unreliable and tax collectors stole people's money back then, it would not have made any sense for Jesus to say to give to charity through the government. Today it does.  I am not against personal responsibility. I believe we should take personal responsibility for ourselves. If I can't drink the water, I will not stand there and ask the government to fix it I will buy a distiller. If I can't pay my rent, I will not ask the government to do it, I will cut back on expenses. If I can't save money, I will cut down on expenses. I can't afford pets so I don't have them. I can't afford kids, so I don't have them. I will get a second job before using charity.  But sometimes people can't cut back on expenses anymore and that sucks.  I live in a neighborhood where homelessness is a problem. It affects my daily life. I wish there was housing for them, and I would gladly pay more taxes to make this happen.
10x1uzd,,j7r4t0b,Why do we need government to educate children? I think private schools and/or homeschooling would do a better job at less cost. Plus it wouldn't require theft in order to keep the system operational. Maybe if we weren't wasting 40% of GDP on government nonsense people wouldn't need so much "help" and people would have more to give to charities. Our current system encourages people to be complacent and ignore suffering because they assume "government will take care of them".
10x1uzd,,j7r5g2j,We need governments to fund education so we can have an educated society. We have already used private schools and homeschooling to educate our population, and that didn't work so well. Our literacy rates have gone through the roof since we have started public education, and our society is better.  So you're saying Sylvia shouldn't be educated because her parents are poor and uneducated? No thanks. I would rather Sylvia be educated.  Option A: Sylvia goes to a public school and gets educated. She makes sometihng of herself and breaks the cycle of poverty.   Option B: Sylvia does not get educated. She has no chance. She remains in poverty and has 5 kids she can't afford.   Which is better for society?
10x1uzd,,j7r8jhi,Sylvia would have a better shot at a good life if government schools didn't exist and she learned via a workbook and khan academy on youtube. The government is the problem with education, not the solution. Private schools are better than public schools, homeschooling is better than government schools - especially now that we have the internet and homeschooling means you have access to the best teachers in the world at little or no cost.
10x1uzd,,j7r9i6t,Children do not learn via screen. Children learn best through games and hand on learning. We had "screen learning" via the pandemic, and most of the kids are behind academically from their peers who were in the same grade pre-pandemic.  So what does that tell you?  I live in a country where public schooling is very good. Private schools do not do it better. Private schools can be picky about who they accept, and therefore they may have better results. Also children who attend private schools usually have rich parents. Having rich parents also results in better scores.  Private schools being better is an illusion. Plus we already had a society that depended on homeschooling and private schools. It wasn't good. I already pointed out, since government schooling we have a much better educated society.   I also know many homeschoolers who should not be homeschooling.  Also both private school and homeschooling are terribly expensive for most families and require educated parents with money. So Sylvia would not be educated at all with your plan.  I think this conversation is over.
10x1uzd,,j7uif0s,Private schools are soo bad that rich parents literally spend thousands to put their kids in. Wonder why? Because they're paying for a actual good education, the public schools suck unless the public school is in a rich zip code. Also rich people are pretty picky with money, you think the rich would save money if they trusted public schools. You think the rich want their kids dumb? No, they are willing to pay for the good schools, the best tutors if necessary
10x1uzd,,j7uuuti,If you make public schools better rich people wouldn't have to send their kids to private schools. In my country the only private schools are religious. Rich people send their kids to public schools and are very satisfied with the level of education they receive. Also, some rich parents do not want their kids hanging out with kids from lower-income families. It is a 2 tier system of education that is completely unfair, and that is why everyone should have a vested interest in making public schools good, including the rich.  Just because you underfund public schools, it does not mean that public schools do not have the opportunity to be good. My goodness, sometimes I think Conservatism is a disease in lack of critical thinking. Is everyone this stupid? This conversation is over. If you have any more questions that were already covered, please read the above comments.
10x1uzd,,j7r3e7j,Everyone benefits from an educated society
10x1uzd,,j7svik7,Also:   Everyone benefits when you treat everyone like a human being. Which includes housing them, even if it's free for them.
10x1uzd,,j7r3db5,[deleted]
10x1uzd,,j7r4cwr,Why do we need government to educate children? I think private schools and/or homeschooling would do a better job at less cost. Plus it wouldn't require theft in order to keep the system operational.
10x1uzd,,j7ufs5l,Completely different, 99% of society benefits if kids know basic math and English and writing.  If they didn't. They would grow up to just be stupid adults and be such a burden. It's better they know basic academics and be able to work towards a good paying job that pays taxes. Essentially they end up paying back what was given to them free as a kid. Still thinking about the abused woman. I mean, if it's temporary. And it helps her clear from the abusive bf. Sure why not.
10x1uzd,,j7uxlm4,We all benefit when they're are no homeless people either.
10x1uzd,,j7vpapz,How does it benefit me?
10x1uzd,,j7vwvrr,WHen there are fewer homeless people, there is less crime, there are less people clogging up the medical system, it costs the government a lot of money to have homelessness, it creates cleaner streets in the cities, people feel less safe when there are a lot of homelesss people hanging around, if homeless people hang around businesses it could hinder people from going in there, the more productive members of society we have the better society is.  Lmao I never thought I would ever have to explain this.
10x1uzd,,j7xjzpv,Wrong, I did the calculations myself, taking in every variable. It is not cheaper to give a homeless a free home. Unless it's a tent. I'm for that.  Show me a spreadsheet of the in-depth calculations and scientific research that supports your claim. Don't show me another country either. Show me the numbers here.
10x1uzd,,j7y166p,SHow me your calculations. Btw, a "home" is not a detached house. Most people are talking about converted office buildings etc.
10x1uzd,,j7qs7vs,I get where you're coming from, but...  It costs less money from the tax-payers to put people in housing than it does to enforce anti-homeless laws and policies.  Also... for most of human history, there were wilderness frontiers that people could move to and build their own houses and start their own communities if they wanted to. That's no longer possible.  Everything is owned.    Now there is no alternative.  People are NOT ALLOWED to be autonomous and free to create their own culture anymore.
10x1uzd,,j7qt5cj,>Also... for most of human history, there were wilderness frontiers that people could move to and build their own houses and start their own communities if they wanted to.  This is still possible, with minimal effort. People do it all the time. Work hard for a couple years to save up some money, buy or build a tiny house and buy a couple acres in wyoming or the dakotas to get you started. You might not be completely self-sufficient at first, but with a little effort you could get there.
10x1uzd,,j7qty7m,Yeah, if you can save up enough money to buy a piece of land.  But it's doable.  Actually, that's the kind of lifestyle I am most familiar with.  Props to all ya'll homesteaders out there.  And thanks for the input.
10x1uzd,,j7r1bsx,I've seen exactly one tree house on here. Most homeless people are not trying at all to do more than pitch a tent. I understand what you are saying but I don't think that the ability to build would help much.
10x1uzd,,j7sfap3,How is it stealing? What do you think tax money is supposed to be used for?
10x1uzd,,j7sgeyi,The income tax shouldn't exist, and it didn't exist for the most of US history. Tax money (federal) should be spent on the few things that the constitution allows it to be spent on: The basic operations of the legislative, judicial, and executive branches, plus defense. That's what the constitution says the federal government is allowed to fund.
10x1uzd,,j7svqcg,They're spending trillions on war planes. They can afford to house the homeless.
10x1uzd,,j7suyjl,The money gets spent either way. There are some people on the street who cost $80,000 a year just for emergency services.  It is cheaper to house people, and also far more humane.
10x1uzd,,j7sg6jr,Are you seriously arguing taxation is theft? Can I call you Scarecrow?
10x1uzd,,j7r8bno,Taxation isn't theft. It's the price of living in a civilized society.  It would be better if we taxed land more and salaries less, though. All land is ultimately the proceeds of stolen property - especially in America.
10x1uzd,j7qrg7m,,We have enough vacant properties to effectively solve the problem is the sad part
10x1uzd,,j7r3ymd,Someone owns them. Many are dilapidated and require tens of thousands to be habitable, but you could buy one for 500. Never seen anyone on this sub do that but I read from someone on another forum who did and remodeled it slowly.
10x1uzd,j7qdxvn,,I hate myself for reading the comments.
10x1uzd,,j7qe5c9,why?
10x1uzd,,j7qea4i,people making assumptions about drug use really get under my skin
10x1uzd,,j7qep00,Dude, me fucking too.  Like... drug use wasn't mentioned in this... meme.. but you can smell the implications.
10x1uzd,,j7qfobl,People will automatically assume that you're a "drug addict" if you happen to be homeless.  They'll treat you like an animal for simply trying to exist.  And then they'll go home, drink their alcohol and eat their pills and get a good night's sleep, assuming that they are any different.
10x1uzd,,j7r1k3v,They are different if their substance use isn't impeding their ability to take care of themselves
10x1uzd,,j7rkidb,Idk. My mom has a friend who is very active in their church. She is never seen with a hair out of place. She lives in a gorgeous three story house. She's on social security but looks and acts like a very well-off woman.   Meanwhile, her husband is a fentanyl addict. He's ODed twice in the past 3 years. Her son is a meth addict. Lastly, her grandson deals meth and is a heroin addict. They all live together in the same house.   Behind every "functional" addict or alcoholic is at least one codependent and enabling person, making their lifestyle possible. Whether it's a family member carrying the load or a boss who looks the other way, there's support there.
10x1uzd,,j7swgrt,I think the opioid epidemic has basically taught us that the only real difference between people experiencing homelessness and people living in houses is that the people with houses have more resources to look like they are clean.
10x1uzd,,j7shnvw,Anyone that has ever taken even a single drink of alcohol took the same action and risk as every alcoholic did. The difference is the alcoholics body and brain reacted differently to the substance.  The only person that can say anything about addicts without being a hypocrite are the people that never took a mind altering drug without a doctors orders.
10x1uzd,,j7sh276,If someone ever had a drink of alcohol they took the same exact risk as me only my brain/body reacted differently and I became an alcoholic. Unless someone has never taken a mind altering drug they are no different from the addict except for a little bit different body chemistry. Everyone reacts differently to a lot of drugs.
10x1uzd,j7r72vl,,Housing is a human right in the way that no one can stop you from buying a house or renting an apartment, provided you follow some rules.   Homes require a lot of resources to build and maintain, so naturally someone needs to pay for it. The easiest way to get housing is if you pay for it (eg through wages), instead of working to make someone else work to pay for it (eg petition the government to tax citizen's wages to pay for it).
10x1uzd,,j7uj0hh,Alot of people think it's just easy as paying for a house for a homeless and that's it. Assuming they don't trash the place. Gotta pay to maintain it. Someone to make sure it's maintained. Property taxes, etc
10x1uzd,,j7si2mr,As long as there is no public/unclaimed/free land to camp, sleep and live on housing is a human right.
10x1uzd,,j7v5lzt,There are no "human rights."  Nobody is owed anything.
10x1uzd,,j7yq54e,Abbott created a space homeless people can sleep on. That's good enough?
10x1uzd,,j7sxubp,Fair points about owning a home. But where do you think the money comes from for emergency services that deal with people experiencing homelessness every day?  If it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars for just Salt Lake City every year, then there is already plenty of money being spent. And you as a taxpayer pay either way.   So if you're going to pay the money anyway, why not just house them? And if it's cheaper to house them and pay a case manager to work with them than it is to pay for emergency services every year ad nauseam (which it is) then why not just house them?
10x1uzd,j7qfahy,,This is the correct answer
10x1uzd,j7req1v,,I have a question about housing first if anyone knows. They don't make people stop doing drugs, but how long will they pay for an apartment for an active drug user?
10x1uzd,,j7sje98,People get clean a lot faster and more easily when they have a safe and stable place to live.  There are different programs, some are for 6 months, some a year and a small limited amount are for life. Some programs require sobriety some don't. Successful recovery is more likely in housed people but your not going to be punished because you suffer the disease of addiction. I was fortunate enough to get permanent supportive housing and I was a human garbage (no meth or needles, but a mess) can. Primarily an alcoholic though with a 3 liter a day Vodka habit. I got off dry drugs about 6 months before getting housed. I got sober from alcohol on my own 3 months after moving in.  I had a couple single night drinking slips early last year.  The safety and stability made all the difference. The housing program also saved my life as I have been having health issues that started early last year that I never couldn't have managed on the street.
10x1uzd,,j7rkpf8,Who‚Äôs doing drugs? Ignorant assumption
10x1uzd,,j7rogql,A large percentage of homeless people are, and it used to be they had to be in a program before they could get housing help, but with housing first they don't. It makes complete sense to me to give them shelter and security before asking them to tackle that, I'm just wondering if they don't choose to, how long those programs will pay for the housing of someone who....that's all they want to do.
10x1uzd,,j7syb04,Housing First will house them over and over until they die. The caveat is that being housed for a year or longer usually disqualifies them from having "chronic" status. Meaning that they have to be homeless for another calendar year before they qualify again.
10x1uzd,j7qrqhc,,I disagree with housing people who have made poor choices.  That's on them, not the state or congress.
10x1uzd,,j7qt9dq,So do people who have made 'poor choices' and still happen to have housing deserve to be homeless as well?  I know it's a silly question, but... think about it.  and what would we consider to be 'poor choices' in the first place?
10x1uzd,,j7r9nsn,There's way too many possible choices to list, to list all the bad choices.
10x1uzd,,j7swp5x,Too many choices? Try "too many factors" that cause homelessness for you or anyone to pass judgment on those who live on the street.

10x1uzd,,j7rdz5c,If caught they get a nice bed and humane living conditions.
10x1uzd,j7sk89j,,Are the working on correcting their mistakes? Do they want to?  Some programs want sobriety first some dont. It has also been shown to be cheaper on society to house homeless addicts. When housed, arrests and hospital costs drop by way more than the cost of housing. Paying for housing can be cheaper than leaving some people on the streets.                         The only requirement that I know of with long term programs (around me) is don't go to jail or get do something to get evicted (which shouldn't happen if rent is paid).
10x1uzd,j7yg5wn,,Housing is not a right.  Shelter requires manpower, materials,  and property,  none of which are free.
10x1uzd,,j7yk3hz,>Shelter requires manpower, materials, and property, none of which are free.  So does education, which is payed for through taxes.  So.. what.. it's ok to educate people for free but not house them?    We are at a point in history where we have the ability to house and feed EVERYONE, with the taxes we ALREADY give to the government.  But some governments would rather take that money and use it to bomb foreign countries instead.  You don't think that people deserve to have their basic needs (food, water, shelter) met?

10wau4v,j7mnm0x,,Invest in some good outdoor clothes.   They‚Äôre your first line of sheltering.  And a power bank to keep your phone charged between receptacles is a good investment.  A comfy backpack is a must.   Not too big or small.  I‚Äôd recommend 40-60 liters.  Good luck.

10wau4v,,j7md7k2,it will not you MUST tell them you are homeless. if you dont you may not qualify for extra amount in food voucher and you will definitely not be expedited, meaning it could take weeks for the application to go through. if you tell them youre homeless they are likely to get you your benefits as soon as same day. call them back, go down there in person..whatever you need to do to let them know your actual situation. list every single expense from phone all the way down to price for hotel to get off the streets. they will look for any reason to cap your benefit amount so you must take advantage of whatever you can possibly get.
10wau4v,,j7mxuub,If there's a day services center for the homeless near you, there's usually someone from the county there who can hook you up with homeless EBT benefits, if available.

10wau4v,j7n92sv,,File for EBT and medical benefits. Tell them you‚Äôre homeless and need to receive your mail at their office. This will expedite the process and you can pick up your card as soon as next day.   Invest in a heating lunch box/ portable oven, small cooler and making where you‚Äôll sleep comfortably, flat and allows you to stretch out.   Once you‚Äôre situated look up community colleges to see who has the best resources for homeless and car dwelling students. You should qualify for free school and tons of help. Most certs are leas than two years and guarantee employment. Look into the trades. Automotive will away be in demand. There‚Äôs also agricultural and construction.
10wau4v,j7n9ece,,Madera has openings at the mission I‚Äôm pretty sure. Fresno is tough, but the tower has a good group of homeless people that took me under their wing when I needed help.

Once you are admitted you are stucknfor about a week but if you get in a hospital with good socialnworkers they will get you set up with med-ical state insurance and hopefully into a sober living (these arent neccessarily for drug addicts, just homes where drugs are not allowed and everyone is expected to be looking for work or working)
10wau4v,j85b757,,1) Do not admit to DSHS that you have any money at all. Take it out of the bank. Put it in your pocket or someplace safe. Any money that you have they will deny you getting GR or even CalFresh. They will want a copy of your bank account. So pull out the cash immediately and then don't use it for at least a month and then apply for GR or CalFresh if you can hold off that long. If you can't, take the money out and then don't admit that you have a checking account, they will ask you how you been managing your money though. So the first way really is the best way. Leave $2 in the account just to keep it open.  2) If you get into a shelter, do not admit that you are going into a shelter because they will cut down your GR to less than $100.   3) Use every organization resource in your area. Ask for help in whatever way they can offer it and follow-up. The people who follow up and show that they're serious about getting rehoused and getting a new job will get job assistance and housing assistance as well as medical.

Anything you think you won't need get rid of. Sign up for Uber eats, DoorDash, whatever delivery service you can think of. If you have a car that's even better.
10wau4v,j7pk15v,,Wow... A lot of answers are great but first you need to assess the situation and your assets. Who can you call for help? Have you called 311(if they have that in America...)? Do any friends have a sleeping bag, or a couch to sleep on? Are you wearing the proper amount of clothing for the season/environment? These are the first steps.  So with that it's a fork in the road. You either have a friend or a shelter providing a place to sleep and hang out, or you're still on your own. If someone is there to help, congrats. Maybe throw a couple bucks their way or donate a couple to the shelter helping. It's always good to contribute when homeless or not because it sticks with your soul.  If you didn't get help that's ok. You will need a sleeping bag, a sleeping mat, a reusable water bottle, a backpack to carry it all, and a location to sleep. If you don't know a secure and private place to sleep or hang out I would suggest looking for one next. A good idea is to find a spot and keep revisiting throughout the day to get a feel of what people or animals will be coming and going in the area. Cardboard makes good insulation and reflects body heat back to you and is great resistance to the coldness.  I think that's all you are looking for. Really you just need to concentrate on eating, sleeping, and mental health. Try to stay out of the skid row if you can...

10w9007,,j7magou,I like the hammock/tarp idea, thank you. I have no idea on tent sizes. I haven't had or used a tent in years.
10w9007,,j7mdkmm,Do you have mosquito problems over there? I'm all the way in North Carolina, 3,000 miles away. You can get a mosquito net for the hammock.    You want to get a mosquito net that's entirely separate from the hammock and wraps around it.  They're a little more expensive but less hassle in the long run.  I would advise against getting a hammock with mosquito net sewn on to it. Those things are usually tiny and the mosquitoes can still bite you through the bottom of the fabric. But those are the cheapest setups so it wouldn't hurt to try it out at first. Use a sleeping pad to keep the mosquitoes off your back and butt.    You'll need a foam sleeping pad on cool nights to stop your body heat from escaping through the bottom of the hammock. They're about $3 to $20 at Walmart.  Hold on...
10w9007,,j7mixrn,More than usual in recent years (the mosquitos) but still not the levels I saw when I lived back east.  Foam pad, good idea. Got a list. Had a friend helping when he thought I'd be living out of the car, but I sort of need a new list now. Appreciated.

10w9007,j7mg0xg,,1. Consult the comprehensive guide at the beginning of this forum for additional referral to resources based on your location. Second, keep a look out for an update to the comprehensive guide soon. I am the author of it.  Guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/wjvkjh/comprehensive\_and\_systematic\_resource\_guide\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/wjvkjh/comprehensive_and_systematic_resource_guide_for/) 2. As you have a little time to assess resources nearest you this is the time to talk to United Way's 2-1-1 or [211.org](https://211.org) website and see what other public and private organizations can help you. 2-1-1 will help localize those resources for you. 3. You may be able to get some temporary rental assistance, if needed, from private organizations with some listings at [https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental\_assistance\_near\_you.html](https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental_assistance_near_you.html). 4. Plan on getting assistance from Orange County by asking about being signed up for discounted bus fare through the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). OCTA website with bus routes: [https://www.octa.net/Bus/Routes-and-Schedules/Overview/](https://www.octa.net/Bus/Routes-and-Schedules/Overview/). If you sign up with a temp agency you can ask if they offer bus discounts like the Perk Pass. [https://www.octa.net/Bus/Fares-and-Passes/Specialty-Passes/Perk-Pass/](https://www.octa.net/Bus/Fares-and-Passes/Specialty-Passes/Perk-Pass/). 5. Make self-help plan to sign up with as many temporary job agencies as reasonable as it can be for you. See the comprehensive guide for suggestions. 6. Recommendation for a "starter" tent is to have a popup tent so as to not not have to deal with the hassle or extra weight of pegs no matter what surface it is placed on. Also make sure there is a tarp underneath the tent and one placed on top. This is to help make sure the tent is not torn on ground debris and as an extra layer against wind and rain. Examples are the following:  Tent: [https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/234717054](https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/234717054)  Tarp: [https://www.walmart.com/ip/X-pose-Safety-Multipurpose-Protective-Cover-Green-Poly-Tarp-5-x-7-Durable-Water-Resistant-Weather-Resistant-5-Mil-Thick-Polyethylene/658817462](https://www.walmart.com/ip/X-pose-Safety-Multipurpose-Protective-Cover-Green-Poly-Tarp-5-x-7-Durable-Water-Resistant-Weather-Resistant-5-Mil-Thick-Polyethylene/658817462)
10w9007,,j7mjy2d,Thank you. I can't work right now, though I may try a supervised thing through the state with other mental health patients. I kept losing teaching jobs, so I tried an hourly job at a grocery store and it was no better. I lasted a week. I am getting help, but a lot of it takes time, medication adjustments, therapy, all that. If I could just sign up for a temp agency I'd just use my teaching license instead and just get a job. Teachers are in high demand. I get that this was likely copy/pasted, but just the same.  Pop-up tent sounds like a good idea -- thank you, and thank you for the links.

10w0cet,,j7kv7b6,Is there any easy way to deal with blood sugar episodes?   I know my mom would sometimes have to stop everything and begin consuming carbs ASAP.  You might be having it go the other way where your blood sugar is too high though.   I'm just wondering if like Pez candy or something like that can be carried for in case of low blood sugar.
10w0cet,,j7l6wfk,Try yougurt. Sweet but has protein. Low blood sugar and dehydration are factors to manage. Support to you.
10w0cet,,j7kvlu9,The thing is candy is the worst stuff I can eat. I have reactive hypoglycemia so it's still going to be a blood sugar roller coaster, but more drastically with candy than anything else. When I was making at least $1k a month, I was spending $1k a month on food. I haven't driven in more than a decade and most of the time circumstances don't allow me to eat anything right away, like at work. I have never had a desk job my entire life. Only jobs where you're stuck outside in the middle of nowhere and only able to carry so much or you would get fired for eating because "metrics".
10w0cet,,j7kz0f7,Ok.  So quality of food matters.   Are things like protein bars bad for you? Apples?    It sounds like quick pocket foods aren't able to manage it for you and you instead need regular meals?  I googled reactive hypoglycemia and it seems that it happens after meals so this is likely after breakfast and after a lunch break for you mid shift?
10w0cet,,j7l22pd,Not really. I tried carrying oranges this past week, but it is hard when you never know when someone is going to suddenly come in close with no mask, and it's only something until I can get home. I often can't eat when I go somewhere due to antimaskers. I can't eat if I am in a medical building. It is rude if I am somewhere where masks are required. I can't eat during medical transport. I can't eat if I am walking down a road with a bunch of people or traffic that idk what maskless person is going to suddenly be in the vicinity.  And I am homeless that I have zero way to cook or pack normal food. I can't even afford to eat most days of the week, and I can't even go inside any businesses to buy anything even if I had the money because no one wears a mask. The best I can do is just not eat at all on not working days and then try to eat on working days. I try to eat right before I have to leave, and I have to suffer through low blood sugar until I get back.

10w0cet,,j7ljb2x,I'm autistic. They always think I'm on drugs.   Nope, I can count on one hand the number of times I've taken prescribed opioids in my life. That is the extent of my drug use.   But I must be homeless because drugs, right?  Can't be that the economy tanked from a mismanaged pandemic and now greedy landlords are price gouging everyone because reasons. Nope, I must just be lying about doing drugs.   I know so many working families that get treated the same too, it's sad.

The only thing I say these days to intrusive questions in general is that that content is behind a paywall and they‚Äôre going to have to pay for that access. The amount of energy I‚Äôm willing to expend defending or debating my humanity is directly influenced by how much it benefits me to engage.

10w0cet,j7l2h9m,,Great post.   Yep, so I often misspeak or am indiscernible.  So I was getting help at a shelter showers, laundry etc, I'm older and sweat for different reasons. So I stared "yeah I have to stay clean. Sweating alot" A lady thought it was drug related comment but I meant whisking away sweat when it's cold and one wears layers. So I explained that.   Thin pple are judged not for obvious food insecurity but instead accused of drug use.   One time and recent I called a girls bluff, she said I was refused blood work because of what they'd find. I stopped, turned around and said, ok I just did bloodeork two days ago, I feel weak, dehydrated, I recovered from lung abscesses plurisy let's run a drug test right now. Ran the rest. Passed. That placed case mgmt at odds with her supervisor when I like everyone and I don't see the ego power trips to fights as mattering. I just walk away or get them to prove me on dope.   There was a post here last week about a trip to Vegas but the intro was "how has homelessness impacted mental health." Seeing drug use us so sad and it was not acceptable I drank in the past not at this time but past tense. Abd today o look back hug myself and say" there's nothing to drink over look how good things are going, be excited about life."   The sober living is required as part of safety and survival. I feel for as in my heart goes out to trying to relieve pain but I tell pple try Aleve and ibuprofen don't use drugs or drink. It just reduces immunity.  I'm still crafting a way to say no I don't use drugs or have addictions. It's disabled physical and mental health issues.   recently, at times, when elders ask me any questions I don't answer. When my age group asks me XYZ at times I won't reply. Homelessness is doing that feature to me. Trying to hold it together drugs can't help any of that.  I try to apply how it's drugging or giving alcohol to our inner child then the person is far less inclined to drink if they meditated on that.
10w0cet,,j7m5ce0,Great post. I just realized there's a lot of spiritual ma fuckas in this sub. Which is cool. It's probably no coincidence either.
10w0cet,,j7nl9en,yep, good ole reddit has alot of angels here. probaly earth angels trying to pray for one another first then judge be mean later on. Nah, I hope the good. prayers. i saw techs growth and development as such a major good for life. it increased selfishness to some degree but a help to mankind. this tech links up all these prayer types. i keep throwing ideas to do the opposite so some behavior like drink which is no big deal but on the streets its a risk factor to a host of consequences. i hope god is at work I dont think homeless matters in that existentially speaking as long as a person is alive then does it matter how housed or moored they are? of courseit matters. i not sure i see lack of housing as a spiritual problem its just is what it is. the existing details of life are not His fault or any faiths doing or fault or suited to comfort a person homelessness is just a circumstance to overcome.
10w0cet,j7lo10d,,I'm no longer homeless but when I was I'd reply:   "Want to pay for a drug test? You could test me right now and I wouldn't care. Why? Because I don't do drugs, never have, never will. I don't even do alcohol or tobacco. The worst "habit" I have is my admitted thing for eating too much chocolate when I am stressed. That's it. It's woefully ignorant of you to assume that the reason I am homeless is because I am an addict.   I am not. What I am is chronically ill and unfortunately very much disabled and while that is not your business I am telling you that so you will get a clue and not just assume that everybody who is homeless is homeless because they are addicted to alcohol or drugs. While it is true a certain percentage of homeless people are addicts many of us are not. We're not all mentally ill to the point of it being dangerous either.   If you really want to know why people are ASK them because the real answers they may just surprise you. Most people that end up homeless are not addicted or harmfully mentally ill at all. They just fell through the cracks financially or went through some really hard times that's all. "
10w0cet,,j7rgeqa,Even being another chronically ill homeless person myself it never stops breaking my heart a little seeing how many of us there are. I think people want to believe we are all addicts because (and this isn‚Äôt fair to addicts either or how addiction works) that‚Äôs something they can blame the homeless person for. It‚Äôs not too different from how often people love to ask if I was born with my disabilities- they want to believe they‚Äôre safe and it couldn‚Äôt happen to them. But it can (and frankly so can addiction, obviously).   Then there‚Äôs the folks- the same ones who insist there must magically be all this support for disabled people, that oh ‚Äújust get on section 8‚Äù like it‚Äôs that easy. It‚Äôs all people not wanting to face the reality of it all, how frankly cruel the world can be, how many of us end up in really bad situations through no fault of our own. It‚Äôs easier to carry on with life if you think everyone homeless is there because of a mistake they made or by choice. If you believe all illnesses magically have cures. If you believe that bootstrap mentality nonsense that if you just work hard you can have everything you ever wanted or needed.   It‚Äôs not even about us at the end of the day. It‚Äôs about them and their comfort and the delusions they want to believe about the world.

10w0cet,j87h1nx,,"Ah yes, those malicious drugs that grew legs and set my house on fire. How sinister of them."     I.e. just kind of coax them into a scenario where they are inclined to believe that the reason you are homeless is because your house unfairly burnt down. It's useful in that unlike all the other causes of homelessness people think they're protected from, this one makes them feel uncomfortable, as they know they aren't safe from their home suddenly burning on them. They get to walk away with the knowledge that luck alone is the only reason their not in your tattered shoes.
10w0cet,j7np06t,,Mine was largely because of drugs, drugs and having nobody who gave a shit about me. Turns out it is easy to get hooked when you are suicidal anyway.   It made me very cold. Nobody really wanted to help me except my gf (now wife). I used to be way more likely to lend a helping hand. But I remember how people judged me and how nobody wanted to help me, save for a very small handful of rare times where someone would maybe let me take a shower at their house, or a time I remember a friend gave me 40 bucks - I think that was the only time that ever happened.   I pretty much dug myself out with almost no help, I live in a state with no Medicaid expansion. I got on methadone, and I had to pay $14 a day for it even when I couldn't afford food. No money meant no dose. There was no empathy even when I tried to help myself.  I fear becoming homeless again all the time, and the scary thing is if it happens again it's not going to be because of drugs. But I am way less likely to help others now, I don't owe anybody anything (unless the friend who gave me that $40 needed help). All I ever heard while I was struggling was that nobody owed me a damn thing. Fine.   I hate it, I wish I still believed in a world where people would help me if I was in trouble and I wanted to help them too. I still find myself with the urge to help sometimes, but I talk myself out of it. No good deed goes unpunished. There was even a time I fell for someones sob story on a similar subreddit, they claimed they had an abscess and needed medication. It was a scam.   The silver lining of everyone treating me like garbage is that I don't owe nobody shit. If I'm such a piece of garbage junkie, they shouldn't be asking me for anything anyway.

10vusru,j7l6u1a,,years? so youve gone years and havent even tried applying for ebt? im confused
10vusru,j7k8snn,,I've been staying in a farm cabin with only a mini fridge and hot plate + microwave for cooking. (and no running water). I'm far from town with no wheels and on a low budget. With so little fridge space, I've been relegated to eating mostly canned goods. Not the full home-cooked meals I was accustomed to having. Or fresh fruit and veggies. Or even TV dinners. So yes I fantasize about all sorts of dishes I miss.  I'd kill for lasagna. Eggs, pancakes, salads, the list goes on. As for fast foods.. Pizza, cheeseburgers, milk shakes.. I can count the times I've had those treats on one hand in the past 11 years. Mostly because I've lived far outside town with no transportation or delivery service.  But I count my blessings I'm not starving. Years ago while homeless I went about 5 days straight without a single meal. I didn't know food pantries existed. Or churches might feed me. I'll never forget how agonizing hunger is. One night I started drawing pictures of cakes and pies on a writing tablet, and I actually ate the paper afterward.  \*Edit: I complained about not having eggs. I forgot I live on a farm with 20 chickens. Haha. I'm gonna grab me a batch. Don't think I've ever eaten farm fresh eggs.
10vusru,,j7m1muf,Farm fresh eggs are absolutely the best far far superior to store-bought...
10vusru,,j7m67hy,Lol wtf was I thinking. There's 20 egg laying hens in a pen, 10 feet from my farm cabin door and I'm complaining I haven't had eggs for breakfast? DOH! moment there. Ok so i got me a dozen today. They're fresh and won't spoil for couple weeks without refrigeration.
10vusru,,j7mgpt7,Check this out you can look on YouTube and look up preserving eggs without Refrigeration, cannot remember exactly what the video was called but they somehow put eggs in a jar on the counter and they last 6 months, so Refrigeration would be no issue
10vusru,,j7o469b,Google lasagna love and sign up for one!
10vusru,j7keb12,,Invite someone homeless, pull together resources and cook for you from scratch.
10vusru,j7kjqll,,Also, google mug meals or single serving meals/cooking for one. If you have the funds or can ask online, a toaster oven would do for simple baking.  A mini crockpot or hotpot is great too.  With those two small appliances your cooking can take on a whole new life.  Amazon takes EBT and can deliver nonperishable food right to you. With a mini fridge I would take food out of its packaging, chop veggies small and put it in baggies, flatten them down as best you can and stack up.  A lot of space is wasted in the packaging.  You can buy six eggs at a time, rather than a dozen.  Apples, bananas, oranges, grapes, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and others just need a cool place for a few days, not a fridge.  Just buy what you will eat in 3-4 days, eating the foods that go off fastest first, like grapes or bananas.  Plan your meals and buy exactly what you need.  Powdered milk in a shaker cup of water takes little space even in a mini fridge, and can be used for cereal, in coffee or for cooking. See if you have instacart where you live, especially if you have EBT.
10vusru,j7ovhhu,,Now that i am homeless, i eat way better than when I had a place, I never cook so much in my entire life.
10vusru,j7lzwn7,,I used to when I was homeless. Most of what I got was really bad shelter food or fast food when I was on the streets. It gets real old after a while. I literally got stuff from trash bags that was thrown out and still wrapped up in plastic from this one coffee place and sanitized the bags just so I could convince myself to eat it.  It was real FOOD, you know? I could not actually dumpster dive. It was just revolting to me thinking of doing that but otherwise I got food wherever I could.  I used to dream about eating steak and mashed potatoes a lot. I practically lived on chips or breakfast bars some days. I'd go to a local food pantry for a hot meal when I was really broke only to find that whatever they made that day had something toxic in it and I couldn't eat it. Broccoli in particular it was just the bane of my existence some days because a lot of places that serve real food think that it's so nutritious and they mix it into everything. I'm actually so allergic that if it touches other food and I eat it I'm in trouble so I'd just have to leave with a roll or whatever and that would be it that day.  I almost liked being on the street better than being in the shelter because at least the food was edible and I knew where to scounge it. I hardly ever went hungry even money-less on the streets. In the shelter I pretty much starved regularly. I'm really not great at that. Food insecurity is really hard for me because there was a lot of that when I was a kid. If I don't have at least a week's worth of groceries on hand I can feel very anxious.  I have diabetes and fasting is a lot harder for me than it used to be. I find I have to eat at least a protein heavy snack every few hours or I just get sick, like nauseated sick. If I was on the streets or in a shelter now I'd be very hard up because it's been getting harder to keep my blood sugar at all stable and if I ate now like I was eating then it would not be cool.  I spend a good chunk of my income past rent and that on food and that despite the EBT. The probably upcoming loss of a lot of EBT funds is going to hit me hard and the food pantries around me are not going to be much help. I'm going to be eating less and eating a lot of stuff I shouldn't just to eat.  That's life of late. I mean it is what it is, but in some ways being street homeless was better in terms of me eating regularly enough. That's sad when you think about it but that's just how not useful the food pantries have been of late. I really need to keep those EBT funds but it looks like it's "Good luck with that!"  Yesterday one of the women in my building told me very solemnly that she plans on selling her diabetic test strips because she can get extra $$$ monthly doing that. That's real healthy that, sacrificing not checking your blood sugar just to buy more food, but I totally get it. They decreased her EBT from $281 to $23. What else is she going to do but find some way to make some other money? She can't work a job, like me she's too disabled, so obviously she's going to end up selling whatever she can. No more OTC meds either.  That's the reality of what they are doing by cutting the EBT for millions of older, disabled people, for the homeless, for everyone truly low income sans kids. They know that but they don't really care. I guess we're just redundant these days...
10vusru,,j7o4ka6,I get a news alert every month that tx is extending the extra EBT for one last month. This month might really be the last.

10vrceq,,j7jpybj,Also check with the city or county for overnight parking.  Santa Barbara for instance, has a safe parking program.  You‚Äôre allowed to park in county building parking lots overnight, without hassle.  You cannot stay during the day, but it does give you a patrolled, police-free, overnight safe place.  LA County or cities may have something similar?

10vrceq,j7kdngl,,Hi OP, I‚Äôm a formerly homeless college student in LA too. Did you maximize your financial aid revenue? Put that you‚Äôre homeless and they should give you extra help and priority attention. I‚Äôm somewhat confused about you asking for a safe place to study as a student? School? Empty classrooms? Libraries? Not trying to be condescending at all but I feel like that‚Äôs fairly straightforward. You can study at a cafe or a 24 hours dennys or something too. Maybe you can try to get an on campus job or some type of part time gig to save up for a living arrangement. Rooms can be cheap depending on the area, and it always bears sleeping outside. If you‚Äôre suffering from mental health issues, I recommend taking advantage of free counseling resources that are probably offered at your college. I noticed you want to transfer to either Berkeley or UCLA, and both schools have better student resources than CC does. What are you hoping to major in?
10vrceq,,j7kz68t,Sorry I meant during the evenings/nights to pull all nighters. But yes, I‚Äôve let everybody know in the correct departments and I‚Äôm currently waiting for Spring disbursement. I‚Äôm majoring in Political Science if that helps.

10vrceq,,j7kcom2,Uhhhh there are student resources and free shelter for the homeless at ucla. You should be getting free food, free tuition and extra money from fin aid. I just got a check for 7k from UCLA for being an independent student with no taxable income. Have you looked into that? You have to keep calling and filing paperwork and it‚Äôs so worth it. Be your best advocate.They also have CAPS and take mental health shit fairly seriously from personal experience. You can get shelter and food and if worst comes to worst, there‚Äôs options for student loans.
10vrceq,,j7kijsy,the ‚Äúfree shelter‚Äù is always full & you can only get the food vouchers during certain times so if you have class when they‚Äôre handing out the food vouchers, you‚Äôre screwed.
10vrceq,,j7klb9q,They give out vouchers for hotels. And food vouchers given out during certain times? You realize you can just walk out of a lecture and get your voucher and come back if this is even true. The resource team will also give you them and help you explore other options. On Tuesdays they give away leftover food for free if you bring a Tupperware. UCLA is extremely accommodating to students in need.
10vrceq,,j7lemck,the school does hotel vouchers? id love a bed for a night and ive only heard about the food pantry on campus
10vrceq,,j7m4clx,Swipes? Bruin shelter free dinner and breakfast?  Emergency housing? U don‚Äôt go here lol
10vrceq,,j7n8u0s,if my lecture is an hour & i have to walk all the way across campus to get the voucher & then walk back, i‚Äôve already missed half of it. i asked for help with housing when the shelter on campus was full & was never offered a hotel voucher. in fact, i have a plenty of e-mails as proof that i was ghosted on several occasions when asking for help.
10vrceq,,j7nbnma,So I currently work in a legal firm, and on my first day of training my supervisor told me to only give intake forms to people who call, emails are largely ignored. Idk how ucla does it but I‚Äôm assuming calls have priority there too. I first emailed them about several things and nothing happened and then I called and things got rolling. The mymessage system sucks. Call them. Visit them. Most lectures should be recorded and on bruin learn. They can send you swipes to ur bruincard.
10vrceq,,j7le0x3,Free food that cannot be stored inside my vehicle, yeah. Why go to a shelter if I have my car? I do get financial aid but it's not enough to afford rent in the area as well as paying my storage unit, car payments, gasoline, cell phone bill, and etc for the quarter especially being homeless it's something hard to explain.. being homeless is the most expensive thing you can do and uhhhhh i wasnt sharing my experience to get sympathy or anything from anyone was just sharing my comaradie with the OP and offering my opinion
10vrceq,,j7m3u9b,I honestly don‚Äôt believe you go to  ucla lol. You clean toilets on campus? That‚Äôs not a asucla position, you can‚Äôt apply to be a janitor as a student union job. Free swipes are literally so easy to get that non homeless people get them a couple days after applying. Literally food is absolutely free. Outside of swipes which you can get as many as needed, they give out free dining hall food on tuesdays. They help connect you to cal fresh which is pretty guaranteed. And late night buildings that are open late? If you were a student you could stay for 24 hours at powell or something. You seem like you really aren‚Äôt using the resources given as a student or you‚Äôre not actually a bruin lol

10vrceq,j7l68m7,,If there's  Planet fitness in your area,  a membership would definitely be beneficial  - free showers, exercise and massage room options, if you opt for the $20 Black card membership (covers guests, so you and your fiance can utilize 1 membership).

10vp46a,j7iywln,,Sure why not? I mean I don‚Äôt recommend just approaching someone with a bunch of books but definitely donate them to shelters, kitchens etc. that usually have free libraries that people can pick and choose from.
10vp46a,j7iyqeq,,You could see if there are any www.littlefreelibrary.org locations nearby
10vp46a,j7iuu36,,They could be something cool to offer. Yes people already have enough to worry about, and yes there are libraries, but some homeless people still like to read, still like recommendations from other people. Ask the individual, tell them why you want to give them the book, make it personal and kind and not just cleaning out the closet and it could mean a lot to someone. Chances are, it will become trash. But I'm pretty sure that a library will take in books if they are in the right condition, so maybe suggest that, especially if they already go to the library. Free library cases are also a really neat way to get rid of your old books.
10vp46a,j7ivc43,,If you live near a Half Price Books, sell or donate your books there. The company works with community centers, shelters, child care organizations and other groups to make age-appropriate books available to homeless and low-income people.
10vp46a,j7ipgcr,,Not at all, they‚Äôre too much to carry around. And many homeless people frequent libraries already because they‚Äôre free
10vp46a,,j7ksuet,Came here to say this
10vp46a,,j7mf7z4,yup thats my point against too. im already struggling with all the weight i have to carry around, i just stick to the essentials
10vp46a,j7j2asd,,Hell. Yeah.  Though I'm not much of a reader now, I sure was used before I had my 4yo. Between him & my recent homeless (thankfully have a temp. home as of recent). Any time I spend reading now is on here & kids books to him lol.   But I had so many homies that were homeless that read to pass the time. Have heard a lot of ppl say it distracted them from their sometimes uncomfortable/unfavorable living conditions.  They traded books and told each other titles to 'keey an eye out for. Always thought that was cool. I love those little "Community Libraries" - like the ones where ppl leave books on like a take one/ leave one sorta basis. It always makes me SO mad when I walk by and they're destroyed or littered with trash. I usually try to pick up a little if I find one like that.  Side note ‚ÄîI hate how the homeless get blamed for shit like that but every homeless homie of mine who frequented them (and every homeless person I've ever seen at one in general) has always been so respectful!    If your town/city doesn't have those & you have the means at all I would try to start one! All you need is a few bunch & for you, a friend, or the city to be willing to find/build something small and decide on a popular location.   If OP (or anyone for that matter) is interested, my DMs are open for questions and I can further explain and or/resources your way.
10vp46a,j7jbl7n,,When you're suffering from dehydration, it makes it a bit difficult to concentrate for reading. Also, some people can't read. Might need to ask.
10vp46a,j7iqeka,,It's most likely just going to end up as street trash. There is enough to carry all ready with just the essentials. Don't need to be carrying around extra books.
10vp46a,j7jto7j,,Upvoted everyone.  Donate books by all means. Cast you bread upon water and pple will be helped by that!!  I read about something heavy..donated old textbook I loved it. Read studied existential personality theory Soviet asian then another personality theory.  Oh I don't think it's a post worthy topic but Sunday I had a awesome meal: Bush baked beans jalapeno plus carrots to lighten up the sugar content. I sprinkled crunchy 1/4 cup of grape nuts. Soooo good. Add some garlic and onion and warm it. Soo tasty with a good book.  The donated books make it to medical offices, shelters, stores at no charge in Norman Oklahoma. Thank you for loving reading;!!!  üìöüìöüìöüìöüëãüíØ
10vp46a,j7izvxq,, I get those lightweight Crossword, word search and Sudoku books seems the ladies I give to really love them. Dollar Tree has large print sometimes as well. Is there a Little Library nearby? Romance and Humor tend to be good ones, I know men love to read as well, just seems the gals like books in my area. So do I win / win!!
10vp46a,j7j9apl,,I would get the women pepper spray for self defense. They sell radios that are also flash lights and you turn a hand crank to power them the new ones even charge phones very nice to have when homeless.
10vp46a,j7j9l45,,I think that other things would be better. First, money. If not, socks, boxers, menstrual products, a sleeping bag (that can be made as small as possible for carrying reasons). Food that does not require cooking and can last a long time. Stuff like that. I think that this has been already answered.  As a non homless person, i wouldn't like someone buying me a random book, becaus there's no way they know what i like/don't like. Add to that the stress of being homeless.
10vp46a,j7je2ln,,My clients enjoy reading, I bring in books every month
10vp46a,j7k607z,,If it's a very thin book, or they have a vehicle with room to carry stuff around in ‚Äî sure. If they have no vehicle and have to carry everything by themselves, it's generally not a great idea. I had to leave all of my books behind when I became homeless, because books are heavy and bulky, which made it difficult to carry them around.  If they have a cell phone, ebooks and PDFs might be a great thing to give them if they are interested. I have a small library on my phone that I can access even if I'm offline.
10vp46a,j7ksq9m,,Well, last time i was homeless in the winter (Which i basically still am, But at least not in murica) i always carried around a pretty Big book, not only because its entertainment But its WAY better to sit on a book when sitting on benches or concrete when its freezing out, because it makes it so Whatever you‚Äôre sitting on doesn‚Äôt suck the last warmth out of you    (Sorry if my English sucks a bit)
10vp46a,j7lu9ts,,I mean not really honestly. Most of us have smart phones that are used for entertainment. Books are just another possession that you would have to lug around with you and isn't necessary for survival. However clean socks would make almost any person on the streets happy üòä
10vp46a,j7mjqt8,,I think so! I definitely have books on my ‚Äúhomeless helpful list‚Äù that I haven‚Äôt been able to borrow from the library, but they tend to be fairly specific and hard to just find anywhere (I‚Äôm mostly seeking foraging books).   If you have good camp resource/recipe books or anything about foraging and gardens I would save those to donate to a shelter, otherwise the library boxes are an awesome way to recycle things. Maybe start one if you‚Äôre able to! We don‚Äôt have nearly enough around.
10vp46a,j7mwu03,,If they have access to storage, yes.  I love my books.  But after awhile, carrying them around everywhere became a physical burden.
10vp46a,j7o4ra7,,That's very nice what you did and I sure he appreciates it! üíï
10vp46a,j7oh0t9,,If all he does is stay in his shelter with no phone then he probably would appreciate a couple of books I know I would.  When I‚Äôm prison with no Phone or tv, lots of prisoners find themselves reading when they normally wouldn‚Äôt bother. It passes the time and if the book is good you get into it
10vp46a,j7owed9,,Maybe write down a list of the books you're willing to give him, and maybe a little snippet of what it's about. Once he's done with one, he can give it back and get a new one off the list that sounds interesting, and maybe someone else can read the first one?  It can save space/weight if he only has the one at a time too
10vp46a,j7p6sfs,,Reading books is a good activity to help pass time but why donate books? We have the library for that (and local Barnes and Nobles). Books would just add extra weight to carry around, in my opinion.
10vo0go,j7ir6ca,,Yeh find an empty house an send some mail there lol
10vo0go,,j7johae,might as well clean the place up and move in while you're at it....
10vo0go,j7iyk6g,,Some churches will let you, the welfare office will, most homeless shelters, the salvation army where I'm at let's you,
10vo0go,,j7lovtn,Don‚Äôt use a shelter address!  You will be banned from donating.  Shelters are considered communal living where disease is more easily transmitted (namely Hep, AIDs, HIV, other fluid-borne illnesses)..
10vo0go,,j7m4gs8,I suspected at much. The place in question, I have been to before, and more than half of the resident are fresh out of jail or prison. I have two plasma centers near me, and the one, ( I don't want to name any names ) has some kind of documentation that I was at the homeless shelter. That is exactly what they said, communal living, and they cited Hepatitis
10vo0go,,j7jtqvz,Yes. They help. Case mgmt office has a Po box too.
10vo0go,j7jqyoz,,i used my car registration that had my old address & matched my id to donate plasma at csl plasma!!
10vo0go,j7jofha,,does a P.O. Box (Post office box) work in such a predicament?
10vo0go,,j7kzq9w,No it has to be a physical address.
10vo0go,,j7lkbl4,that's such bullshit.    If that's so, your society wants you to be homeless... and suffer.... to make an example out of everyone else who doesn't fall in line.
10vo0go,,j7lkluv,It's the FDA And GHA regs. Not on the centers btw. They are incredibly heavily regulated and under constant scrutiny. I worked at a CSL, I'm not sure all have the GHA regs as well but they do.
10vo0go,,j7lpzkd,I had an AWL license for almost 10 years, but the ALA sent me a FML Q&A, so I'm DOA, can't afford my licensing fees,  now, I'm LID.  I just made that up.  Oh, hello there! Can you please speak in English? Spanish?   ...Thai?!
10vo0go,,j7lqohy,CSL is legit the name of the plasma center. FDA is who regulates food and drug is the US. GHA is German health authority because they buy some of the plasma and the company is at least partially owned by them.   CSL also used to go by ZLB plasma, they changed it around 2010 (?) Maybe 2009 don't remember exactly. Once a year they fly in a bunch of German health authority auditors over to come watch people do their jobs and grade you. It was stressful because if you dont do everything EXACTLY perfect the entire center can get shut down.
10vo0go,,j7ls7gr,Ah, ok. Please forgive my dumb sense of humor.  I haven't a clue about the health care system in Germany.
10vo0go,,j7ltt0e,Oh I did figured I'd just explain so it made sense. There were some other 4 letter acronym type regulatory people as well I just don't remember what lol.   If I remember correctly the address thing was part of how they tracked people to make sure they weren't donating other places/states for their own safety. People used to try and go to ours and Talecris (other place), that and a blacklight dye finger marking system solved much of the issue. I'm sure they probably have a different system than that by now as well.  Frankly not sure how the address helped with that, but the dye made sense.
10vo0go,,j7lvoae,Well... it's all totally different depending on the location...   hey!!!  u/Constant_Guidance_   what country do you live in?
10vo0go,,j7lw62n,From SS card I assumed America, I thought it was usually called something else in different countries?
10vo0go,,j7rgpgy,Welcome to America ! Where the health care system is a crime against humanity ( all in the name of all-mighty capitalism, of course ) , the food is *garbage ,* and sex is everywhere but the place it should be ! ! !
10vo0go,,j7tzgg7,Haha, very well said.
10vo0go,j7lqjy6,,Don‚Äôt use a shelter address!  You will be banned from donating.  Shelters are considered communal living where disease is more easily transmitted (namely Hep, AIDs, HIV, other fluid-borne illnesses).  Source: I work at a homeless shelter & donate plasma.  I‚Äôve been told his many times by staff often.  This may be different in your state.  Even if you aren‚Äôt staying at the shelter, don‚Äôt use the address (either way you won‚Äôt be able to donate).
10vo0go,j7mva8i,,What's your location? Find an empty house and use that address. If you need documents.....have someone in write up a little lease agreement for a bedroom and sign in it real sloppy so as not to be a legible name.
10vo0go,j7no70k,,When I was homeless I was new to the whole STD interrogation thing (never had to prior) . I guess it does make sense just awkward.
10vo0go,j7rfo2k,,Can anybody verify if my N.C. photo I.D. , ( the one with the gold star ) can be used as proof of address ? It has my address, and the internet says they can accept it.  Any shake-out to this rumor ? Anybody with experience ?
10vo0go,j8kv1tl,,A little late but hopeful this will help someone.....in the current high tech world we live in you can set up a virtual mail box, for a monthly or yearly fee, and all of your mail gets sent to the company's office address that you choose and they email you photos of each piece of mail you receive. you can then decide if you want them to forward, scan, schedule a pickup, discard, or shred each individual item and since you will have a physical address you can use it on your id to establish residency or even to register/start a business
10vo0go,j7ledr7,,General delivery. Just use the post office address.

10v7phx,j7hu8b2,, 24 years old and homeless as of 5 months ago. I have been living out of my car and traveling around playing small gigs for money (folk singer) but have just ran out of gas and money leaving me stranded at a roadside park in the middle of nowhere. Been stuck here for 4 days and ran out of food and water last night. Not sure what I‚Äôm going to do about that. But at least I‚Äôve got my car to keep me out of the cold wind. Still pretty cold though

Be very diligent about getting to a populated area, even if it is a smaller town with a gas station  If you are out out of gas, call your car insurance company right away and see what kind of roadside assistance is available. If you do not get a helpful answer, than consider Good Sam's new membership offered. There is auto coverage for $49.95 for a yearly membership.

10v7phx,,j7i448a,Thank you I‚Äôm looking into that now
10v7phx,j7oxtaf,,My time being homeless started after I fucked up and misread the schedule on when I was supposed to work, and noone could get in contact with me because my phone didn't have service. With the company I work for, it's three no-call no-shows before you're terminated.  The guy that had the shift before meessed up and called the district manager, and not the store manager.  For roughly about half of the year and a month I was homeless I lived in one of two shelters, one Salvation Army, and one that doesn't exist in a 'chain' (single location).   The other half I lived outdoors. For a while it was under a bridge near a creek, and another lady slept there too. On Saturdays there would be a church service there, so I had to wake up a bit earlier than normal so I could pack my things and set them aside so chairs could be set out. I'm not what some people may call s Christian, but I kinda miss those services.  After my 'roommate' checked into a shelter, I moved everything of mine to a more public and visible place across the street from the library. That way if a guy came by and wanted to do things and wouldn't take no for an answer, I was closer to a place I could go for help.  Though that was in Texas, and I was breaking one of the anti-homeless laws. I was ok for a few weeks, but one day I was leaving the library to go eat lunch, and three police officers cornered me (well, sorta?) And one asked me if my name was such and such. He said that I needed to move my things or they would be tossed in the trash in what I remember as an annoyed/angry sort of tone, and him nearly touching my back with his chest as he and the two other officers went with me to my 'spot'. I kept my cool, said yes sir/no sir, and cleaned my spot like they said to. I'm not sure if me doing that made a difference, but one of the officers called the Salvation Army on the Arkansas side of town, and offered to take me and my things to the health clinic for a covid test, and I walked the short distance to the SA shelter.  Then maybe around the last week of December,y former boss told my mom to tell me to reapply to the store I worked at, and when the 1st day of 2022 rolled around, I wasn't homeless anymore. Stayed withy aunt for two or three weeks until I could get an apartment of my own- those first three weeks or so I was making bank in overtime.   The time I spent in the not SA shelter, I got a diagnosis of major depression and general anxiety, but without access to transportation most of the time, I couldn't go back for refills on my meds when they.ran out.

10v591s,,j7gb198,no.  You seen the Wire?  Best demo of it in fiction, but it's a real life phenomenon.  If someone is selling literally deadly product, you know it's strong.  So when a product kills some people, it's a selling point for the people with the highest tolerances.  Now they  may misjudge and OD themselves, but they know that.  It's not quite suicide.  It's more just hazardous products, lack of truth in labeling,not having hte information available to titrate correctly, and people taking risks to nurse addictions and misery.

There are several ways that the food stamps office will recover the overpayment. If you are still receiving benefits when you have to pay back food stamps, the amount you receive will usually be reduced by either $10 or 10% per month (whichever is greater). If you are not receiving any food stamps it is $25 a month.

10v591s,,j8blh81,Yeah it's an exchange and they have classes and safe needles and stuff for homeless people but not an infection site and it's against rules to use it there

10v591s,,j7na4cn,People smoke fent on the train, bud and at all the bus stops on Van Buren. You see small pills on the ground here sometimes and you get offered them for $5 constantly.
10v591s,,j7jgd6r,It still is.
10v591s,j7gme65,,I think part of the hike in ods is the switch in popular street stimulant from cocaine to meth.  Ive nearlt killed myself with a mickey while on meth \[drink the whole thing fast sleep deprived on an empty stomach.\]  Gives me the spins like im 14 again.  Im not sure if meth makes people more reckless than coke in general, but the price difference means meth users will be high way more often than coke users.  My point is people arent oding on meth, but oding on fent  accidentally cuz tweaked.  I suspect ADHD may play a role, as my experience is a little speed helps but too much tanks my working memory to the point im a nuiciance to myself, losing all my shit, almost oding on mickeys, ect
10v591s,,j7gxlsy,I got what you're saying. I think it's important to treat (when you can get treatment) different types of neurodivergence alongside the addiction. Because without managing the symptoms of those, you can't address the underlying reasons for someone chasing relief from the symptoms - it's part of the reasons for addiction.
10v591s,,j7gt7gi,Bro you‚Äôre just rambling wtf lol
10v591s,,j7guqk1,I think it is a grammar problem stemming from adhd/asd  my asd side falsely assumes others will have actually read the article while my adhd adds a strong dash of incoherence.
10v591s,,j7ir9se,I have ADHD. Your writing style reminded me of mine. Connected and pulling all sorts of things into a conversation sometimes and people get lost sometimes. I never connected it to my ADHD but maybe it is. Honest question though, did you have a buzz when you wrote that?                        I suspect that Meth use over time causes symptoms like ADHD as Dopamine receptors or production gets destroyed.
10v591s,,j7iqrjx,Seems like ADHD however that may just be part of the new personality from using to much meth for too long. The comment gave some good insight, especially for people not particularly familiar with these drugs. I was a garbage can but Meth I stayed far away from.
10v591s,,j7j23lm,Yeah. ‚ÄúNew personality‚Äù sounds right.   Why do people who are clean off meth always seem like they are still tweaking
10v591s,,j7mf3nx,It literally burns out receptors in the brain. Add to that paranoia and massive sleep deprecation as well as malnutrition and whatever wlse.  They talk about wet brain in bad long term alcoholics, some jokingly referred to as pickling your brain. I believe I have damaged my body from alcohol but brain so got lucky with, especially since its already screwy, lol.  I dont know if there is a term for it but heavy meth use, not even necessarily long-term, seems to do something similar to alcoholic pickling only weirder.
10v591s,,j7iqc7f,Meth will permanently mess up your brain, worse than anything else. I've been to over a dozen long term rehabs and there has never been much Meth around my area but every Methhead in rehab was nearly as crazy 3 months clean as they were on day one.  Lasting paranoia and inability to tell what was real and what wasn't even from the past. This one dude had a scar on his forehead from cutting out the government implant. Two months later he still believed it had really happened. It completely destroys the part of your brain that lets you experience happiness too.  It was so sad.  Straight up I would rather be hooked on fentanyl than Meth and the 4 months I used fentanyl was the worst of my life. 4 years later and I finally got off of MATS. My last Sublocade injection was 100mg on Oct 26th. So far zero withdrawal which is what I read about and why I went on it. I haven't felt like an opiate addict since I switched to the Sub locate which I was on for one year. Zero withdrawal, its like a miracle. Without it I would have never gotten off Suboxone. I started on Methadone and used that for about 8 months. 140mg to zero in 30 days with 3 day gap before Subs. It was not as bad as I expected but not easy.                 TLDR: I was a human garbage can for years except for meth. Don't do meth!
10v591s,,j7nggif,That's your experience and like opinion man. Not the truth. Reality is subjective and the subjects experience is always not nearly factual.
10v591s,j7h1l95,,Blues kill a lot of people who use them. Homeless or not. I mean I don‚Äôt want to see anyone die but it‚Äôs kinda the risk you take right?
10v591s,j7i2eyy,,Fentanyl is killing people everywhere. I live in Kitchener, ON, Canada and we are currently experiencing an unprecedented opioid and homelessness crisis.
10v591s,j7h5i1b,,Alcohol still kills more people than anything
10v591s,,j7irpig,Its because there is so so so so so much more of it being used and not just by heavy drinkers and alcoholics but in general. The fact that its legal is what makes the real difference. People died and went blind a lot during alcohol prohibition. Legalize and regulate drugs and there would be drastically less overdoses as people would know the ingredients and exact dosage they were getting.
10v591s,,j7mi2uw,It is straight up a poisonous toxin. It is also the waste product of yeast so people are drinking the hybrid shit/piss of a microorganism. I hope those who read this enjoy tv their next drink, lol.
10v591s,,j7jgb62,Not in Arizona...  200+ a DAY.
10v591s,,j7mgbo4,Got a source?                That's over 70,000 a year. Last year it was just over 100,000 a year which would work out to 300 a day nationally. Your telling me Arizona makes up 2/3 of overdose deaths asfor the united states total in 2020.  Unless your talking about a spike of few days I find that hard to believe, but I don't think its impossible. I find it hard to believe because that would be disgusting and saddening and wouldn't want to believe it.               Edit: in 2020 the overdose deaths for fentanyl in Arizona were 2550 for the year                  The most recent data reports that the state had 2,723 overdose deaths from April 2021 to April 2022. CDC estimates 150 deaths a day from fentanyl overdoses.

10v591s,,j7mvzlx,I used Sublocade and it was like not even being an addict. After a year, it builds up in your body and you just stop. It self tapers over 4-12 months and no withdrawal or anything. Seriously like I was never an addict. Its not advertised much because I don't think they intended to make a cure but just a new type of suboxone people would take forever. Been since Oct 26, 2022 with no buprenophine and I'm fine.  Before switching to Suboxone and then Sublocade  I was on 140mg day methadone.

There are several ways that the food stamps office will recover the overpayment. If you are still receiving benefits when you have to pay back food stamps, the amount you receive will usually be reduced by either $10 or 10% per month (whichever is greater). If you are not receiving any food stamps it is $25 a month.

10v591s,,j7m1r7l,I spent many warm nights in psych hospitals! Problem is, when you're homeless, the ambulance comes and sometimes they won't take you. You have to say you're suicidal or homicidal.
10v591s,,j7mj6k5,I would just go to sleep in the middle of the road. When the cops stopped they would begin writing a ticket until I tell them I was waiting for traffic (get confused look) but if they want to save themselves from paperwork they can do it Immediately to.... Cop: do what? Me: Run me over! There's been no traffic. Why the fuck else would lay down in the middle of the road? Boom, no ticket and taking a ride. I do get suicidal thought and that was based off of a real incident. I actually fell asleep in the road. A big city yet no traffic suddenly where I chose to be a speed bump.  Im not suicidal right now but am struggling really bad and my health is shit. Bad results of an EKG today too. 42 and I'm not to optimistic of 52. Im more sad than scared.

10uzedd,j7h85vr,,I dont think it makes much difference, Surrey and Kelowna are danger hotspots according to stats, but I dont find surrey scary.  The strangest thing I found is Calgary street people are surprisingly hard, quicker to steal or roll you than Vancouver, but Calgary general public is quite friendly to homeless compared to supposedly liberal Vancouver.  btw I wasnt rolled but seemed to hear of it more in Calgary.  I did lose a couple laptops there that I just turned away from for a second lol.
10uzedd,j7oxyfq,,I follow a homeless guy in...Ontario I think it is on TikTok, and he posts videos reviewing the food he gets from various sources, and the shelters there. If you want, I can try and find out his UN and send it your way?
10uzedd,j87oqm6,,Eh. Not homeless myself, but I've slept a couple nights in the car in Calgary and spent more then one night on occasion sleeping in the University of Calgary and it seems ok I guess. Can't really see where'd you'd go if its winter out though. Train stations are regularly swept through here due to the amount of addicts smoking in them and unless you're clean most places seem to afford enough security to kick you out of them. Also not a lot of nice spots around here from what I've seen, cause a lot of the construction here is newer.     Though I can't say the people here treat the homeless as particularly bad either, mainly because I don't think most people see it as a massive problem in Calgary compared to other major cities. Most of the homelessness is restricted to the C-train lines and therefor your only really walking past them during the part of the day your commuting. Kind of a - not bothering me yet so I'm not going to worry about it yet- kind of mentality, where we're just glad we're not Vancouver yet, and thus don't really bother the homeless, nor try to improve it. Seems we've adopted a motto of "Just be clean shaven" around here and ask you to not be strung out on Fentanyl in public, and so long as you can do that no one will bother you. Lots of volunteers though for whatever reason.
10uw863,j7g8mlf,,My take: people who looked down on us and never dreamed they‚Äôd end up here find themselves homeless, and decided the term was unpalatable to their sensibilities.   So they changed it up.   Now they can feel better. Still homeless though.

Like most of the cheap bags you'll see at places like Walmart that will have the rating shown, usually 40-50‚Å∞ or whatever...that generally the survival rating...NOT comfort rating. By that I mean even if you find a bag that's survival rates at 30‚Å∞ it doesn't mean you'll be comfortable or even completely warm..it just mean it will keep you alive. If you can afford it, I have the Stansport Flannel sleeping bag comfort rated to 0‚Å∞ and that thing cooks me, and I've slept in it down to the lower teens and not felt a thing with just sleeping in my long johns (also another good thing to buy). Paid about $80 on Amazon for it, well worth the money..though it is a tad heavy at 5 pounds.  Good luck out there OP

Mine has nail clippers, man scape buzzer for cutting hair. Some siccors and stuff. Keep your tooth brush in its own thing so it doesn't get dirty. I use one of those sealed coffee mug for my tooth brush and toothpaste. I can carry it anywhere and people won't think much of it.. you may also need a hammer, utility blade, you need to keep your feet dry no matter what so extra socks in a dry bag.

10urlc4,,j7i6rdf,Free sign is a solid idea. Saw it a lot living in a major city. I know, no matter how needy I am, if I see a random jacket or something in the park I tend to assume it belongs to someone and I‚Äôm not going to touch it. And you sometimes get the type of folks who will take things to a lost and found or post in neighborhood groups about finding an item.   I‚Äôd also toss out looking to see if you‚Äôve got a community pantry or fridge type thing around. Or even one of those Little Free Libraries (I used to help care for one that would sometimes get food items and sanitary products) but be mindful they do often have rules and not all will take clothing items but those are heavily utilized by folks in need.
10urlc4,,j7qbdv8,Yeah I do that already.. I have a van that I just have stiff I give away but it‚Äôs not easy finding people .. Plus homeless people don‚Äôt have access to water a lot of time so soap is not huge and people don‚Äôt want to have to carry even more stuff

10urlc4,j7grjj2,,In terms of clothes, it's best to donate them to Homeless services. Especially day centers.  For water, it would be best to either give it to someone whose flying a sign. Or putting it in a Free Food Pantry, if your neighborhood has one.
10urlc4,j7oy8ka,,Maybe there's a church in your area that does homeless...I guess outreach? If there is, you can offer to donate something to help. Church group sets things up, with different things in different boxes (one is bar soap, another is body wash, socks in another). That way the people can pick what they're in need of, and not things that they can't/won't carry with them.
10urlc4,,j7qcpun,The churches aren‚Äôt the best at out reach they acually run off homeless and have spikes on entrance areas
10urlc4,,j7tcum5,I haven't seen anything like that around here, but that doesn't mean other areas don't have them
10urkzj,j7dgxtz,,Get a gym membership, a camp stove, a pot to cook in, and a sleeping bag. Make a bed in the car or just sleep in the drivers seat. Keep your job

10urkzj,j7e5056,,Check out:  r/roomandboard (the mega thread has some helpful links), r/assistance (request advice/support), r/momforaminute - can be a source of advice and resources.  I think someone mentioned r/urbancarliving, there's also r/vandwellers which has some links to mechanics like r/askamechanic I think.  Is it an option to stay with family or friends in the area?  Your girlfriend?  Pay rent, contribute to the household and save up for your own place?
10urkzj,,j7fmwnb,Thank you so much for the links, I wasn't aware of how many reddits there were for support.  I don't have any family or friends that I can stay with, things have been pretty rough for me for the last few years and I've distanced myself from everyone because of it. As for my girlfriend, we've only been dating for a month and she lives with her father and his gf. I haven't asked about staying there and I really don't want to because I don't want to be a burden
10urkzj,j7gjbjw,,Small homes in cass detroit.   No credit needed.  U can afford.  Google it.  Good luck
10urkzj,j7eyvzv,,I would do the stuff recommended here as a Plan B just in case you do end up living in your car. Get some gear together, scope out somewhere you can stay, and see what resources you can find nearby. Get a storage unit if you can.
10urkzj,,j7fmo93,Can you live in a storage unit? Why would I need one? I think I am going to end up staying in my car even just for a few months if it comes down to it. I'm concerned about finding spots to park at during night, there isn't anything in town for me to stay at. There is a Meijer about 15 minutes away though that would probably be safe to stay at
10urkzj,,j7iat5s,A storage unit is for your valuables and stuff you don't want to take up space in your car for example if you need room to sleep.  I would park somewhere with high-density housing and lots of other cars around, then park when it gets dark and leave when it gets light. That should get you started, you work out better methods and relax more as you get in to it.
10urkzj,j7f500x,,Are you unable to stay with your girlfriend?  In addition to the advice already posted here, I would recommend buying a multipack of hothands for emergency heating.
10urkzj,,j7fmioq,I have not asked my girlfriend if I can stay with her, but she knows of my situation and how awful my mom is in general. I don't want to burden her with myself or guilt her into letting me stay with her.  Staying warm is my biggest concern so this is a great idea, thank you
10urkzj,j7fblhu,,Search Michigan special housing program. It is on the Michigan.gov website. They may can give you some help. Also contact the Salvation Army or any shelters. I wish you luck.
10urkzj,j7fdzsa,,Look for a youth shelter that is the best bet for someone your age. So sorry you are going through this.
10urkzj,j7fp0rr,, First give everything a deep overview anything you know you do not need nor want sell it. Outfit your car, I know Michigan is very cold hoping by March it gets warmer for you. Absolute save, save much as possible.   Car: battery, tires, oil change make sure all are in good standing because needing a tire could set you back 200.00   Clean it out while you have time now, blankets, insulation, emergency first aide kit, pads & tampons, get your soaps shampoo face cleaner make up together if you use any of these.   Laundry bag for dirty clothes and towels. EBT apply now so you are not waiting.   Make a plan. If you stay in car you could save money, every dollar needs to be accounted for food, gas, or emergency. Look for free things in your area at night or weekends, also possible to get another job even know to help out yourself finacially?   Do not depend on your partner nor anyone have an exit plan.
10urkzj,,j7fq7y6,Right now I am looking to be promoted to a shift lead at my current job which would give me 14/hr, and I was told I could work as many hours as I want (it's a smaller business so I know for a fact I could work as much overtime as I want. The store manager is very understanding) and I will be promoted to manager which would give me a monthly bonus check and starts at 15/hr.  I've applied for EBT in the past with no luck, I'm not sure if it would work now. I'm on my mother's case, and she already gets EBT for herself and my little brother.  I have a sedan, so it's a small car. I am a bigger person as well, but I know I can manage sleeping in it. I've slept on a broken, busted in couch for three months now, I think my car would be fine.  The only major issue with my car right now is that I have to get my coolant system and engine flushed as the previous owners did not keep up on it and I have some sludge in them. I just got an oil change (that's how we found the sludge) and I got new tires when I got the car a few months back. I know the battery is fine too. I do also need to get a pulley fixed but I don't know how much of a major issue that is, I just got a new serpentine belt because that's what I thought the issue was but my car is back to squeaking again.  My biggest concern right now is where I can park to sleep at, as there is no big grocery stores near me (they're all about 15 mins away). My town has a very small parking lot for public parking I saw, but I don't know the limitations on that. We also have a small town grocery store/plaza. There's a storage unit facility in town too, along with a gym. The gym is expensive though, it's an anytime fitness.   Can I use a space heater in my car? I would get a small one and would only use it for a little bit on those bitter cold nights
10urkzj,,j7gsez4,Space heaters usually require a lot of voltage. So, I don't think it would work in a standard car.  My suggestion would be getting a good sleeping bag. I have one that's rated for about 10 Fahrenheit.
10urkzj,,j7g6ub0,Hmm... I do not know much about space heaters in cars I would check out car life on reddit folk there now damn near everything about car situations. Do not forget to file your taxes! It takes about 3/4 weeks to get Federal back with automatic draft its sooner. I would file independent for a Michigan Bridge Card.   Question: is it possible to work anything out with your Mother? Offering to pay rent? IDK the situation for trying to not become homeless is the first challenge.   Sounds like you are in better shape than many here, so thats a damn good start.
10urkzj,,j7ga3qa,I've already started filing myself, TurboTax says I'm not getting much back this year so idk if that's really gonna help. I just need my one other w2 from my grandma.  I already pay rent to my mother to sleep on her couch. The situation is pretty awful, she's a raging alcoholic and has never liked me. We had a huge blow out a few days ago, it was 12:30am and she came home plastered demanding to listen to music in the living room where I sleep (she has her own room, she just wanted to bother me. She's petty like that) I told her I have to work at 9am tomorrow, she just lost her shit and started screaming and throwing all my stuff around.   There's no way she's going to let me stay there, even if she did I don't think I really should. I've been in a very very dark place again mentally from her.  I am grateful to at least have my car to fall back on, I know I'll survive if I keep pushing. I just don't know anything about what to do
10urkzj,,j7hl6p2, If something changes and you do end up staying sounds like its time for new scenery anyways. Hoping it will resolved until weather gets warmer I would 100% still begin making a exit plan.
10urkzj,j7jj24o,,My storage unit rant:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/qc72qc/comment/hhl19s1/?co](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/qc72qc/comment/hhl19s1/?context=3)[ntext=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/qc72qc/comment/hhl19s1/?context=3)  I see elsewhere in this thread that you are skeptical about a storage unit.

10urkzj,j7j16d3,,[This blog](https://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2005/02/interactive-list-of-best.html?m=1) has a wealth of information, and much of it is specific to being homeless in a car.
10urkzj,j7jpgiq,,This was touching to read, I can imagine how bad you may feel. Let me know if you are interested in getting a remote job, I have a friend who is seeking a Personal Assistant and a Customer service rep, kindly let me know if this can help in any way.
10urkzj,j7xv27q,,Look into live-in nanny positions. If ur a clean cut, presentable young women, you can live for free in a nice home & earn $$. Look on Care.com Nextdoor and other sites to advertise or find eldercare or childcare positions.i know girls who make up to 60k annually & live in safe, beautiful homes and are a valued member of the family.
10ujq5b,j7c99hu,,Of course.   Homelessness is a situation, experience, a hurdle (for some) , a society issue, etc.   Happiness is a state of being, an emotion etc.   Just because one thing is a factor doesn't negate the existence of everything else. Life is and will always be change and not black or white.
10ujq5b,j7cr63z,,I was happier the 10 years I was homeless on the road than I have been in the years since I'm housed up.  In fact my years homeless were the happiest of my life
10ujq5b,j7cb2rw,,Happiness is usually a state of mind, not wealth.  Miserable people tend to be miserable whether rich or poor.
10ujq5b,,j7dkqa4,That is not necessarily so. Depression creeps up on you very slowly and you do not even know you have it. Living every day and thinking it is a normal state of mind.   It is not.
10ujq5b,j7cqrxm,,Yes.  I‚Äôve had some happy moments recently.  Staying in a shelter - I‚Äôve across some genuinely decent people and we‚Äôve had some good times together.
10ujq5b,j7ca03s,,Yes.
10ujq5b,j7cj66d,,Yes. Even impoverished people can find happiness.
10ujq5b,j7cp20v,,I'm homeless and happy. I'm well rested, and the least stressed I've been in years.
10ujq5b,,j7cxkam,Where do you sleep if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? That‚Äôs my only reason for not being stress free is not having the safe spot to sleep
10ujq5b,,j7d7mpq,I avoid homeless camps at all costs. My tent is only 3 feet tall so I can hide in bushes or tall grass. I use google maps on satellite view and zoom in to find a spot with trees and bushes I can hide in.   I'm also willing to go to spots that other people won't. I stayed in an old staging area for road construction in Savanah,  GA. There was a locked gate with bushes on either side where I could just walk around the side of the gates.   Never let anyone see you come in or out. I never take anyone back to camp, and I never tell anyone where I'm camped. If they ask I just lie and vaguely say 'I'm up over that way a long way out,' and point in a direction away from camp.
10ujq5b,,j7e0ted,I was going to reply to the OP that being as comfortable as possible is a big factor for being happy. A premium spot goes a long way towards that.    In South Florida it will be miserably hot at night 9 months of the year. So not only does my spot have to be safe and dry; it has to have electricity. Having a fan makes a world of difference. Keeps you comfortable and keeps the mosquitoes away. The electricity doesn't have to come from an electrical outlet. You can buy a converter from Home Depot. It turns a light socket into an outlet.
10ujq5b,j7d5w10,,I‚Äôve been homeless a while now and I‚Äôve never been happier.    There‚Äôs some huge hurdles and plenty of stressors that crop up, but they are all quite easy to cope with.     No family, no possessions, no commitments means you can act unilaterally to benefit yourself, or anyone else.    No second guessing; no apologies or explanations required.
10ujq5b,j7dl5qj,,Of course. When I was on the street, I was happy a lot of the time. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily happy *that* I was homeless, but being homeless did not preclude me from being happy.
10ujq5b,j7csv70,,Since its possible to live in a mansion and be unhappy, it seems logical that one can be homeless and happy.
10ujq5b,j7d34as,,Perhaps if u are still young yea. Probably not so much wen past like age 45.
10ujq5b,j7da9tt,,Not conducive to happiness in its standard arrangement. Possibly no barrier if you have something you love to occupy your time. Connecting with nature and animals. Thinking of that guy with the [lambscaping service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U54HRmglYEA). Self-sufficiency and something productive to do quite indispensable to maintaining good mental health. And obviously a drug habit and alcoholism is a drain on one's sense of wellbeing. Of course this may be contentious to some and I only offer it based on my personal experience.
10ujq5b,j7daapi,,If it's about the journey not the destination, a long walk can be quite enjoyable. Especially when you don't have to worry about the stuff you own.
10ujq5b,j7e24a4,,Yea. It is. Some of my best memories, hardest laughs, and biggest smiles are from the ten years I was on the street.
10ujq5b,j7e2871,,Yes... I fully intend to become homeless in a couple of years and catch up on some long overdue fishing in the Gulf, hiking in Wyoming, and beachcombing in Oregon   ...that being said, I dunno about being homeless in a city, I imagine that would suckass pretty gawddamn hard, fuck them city slicker, Babylon system, captiol district yuppies and all the gawddamn cops and shit...   fuck that...   I need wide open spaces, sand between my toes, and the drip-drip-drip of rain on my tarp in a old growth forest, with a campfire and fresh trout in my pan, lookin' to hook the next highball up the Willamette to the Judith Gap

10ujq5b,j7ecygb,,Happiness is a state of mind and yes it is but you have to learn to embrace the positive little things that happen for example if I managed to eat that day that makes me happy, I managed to put fuel in my car that made me happy, little things that cause happiness for me was knowing that I was progressing towards getting a home.   Every time I apply for a job that made me happy.
10ujq5b,j7efj4s,,For some yes but not for me, I hate waking up in the morning. It‚Äôs a lonely existence and it‚Äôs draining away my youth
10ujq5b,j7ez0lv,,Yes, but if disaster strikes then it's hell.
10ujq5b,j7frfry,,Buddha did it. Lao Tsu did it. Many have done it.
10ujq5b,j7fwi84,,Yes, it is
10ujq5b,j7gc0wg,,Yes. People can be happy and miserable at every financial level. Of course things hit harder when you're homeless but I find keeping a cheery disposition is crucial to survival.
10ujq5b,j7gy0pk,,Yes.
10ujq5b,j7tuhlr,,Yes. It is impossible for any person or situation to be all bad, all of the time.
10ucl28,j7c6hpe,,Formerly homeless here. A couple of things:  1) Whatever you offer, DO NOT force your clients to sit through religious services. I was raised Southern Baptist (now a Unitarian), and I don't remember anywhere in the Bible where it said to feed the homeless only if they attend chapel.  2) No one at the shelter I was in was qualified to teach job skills. They also seemed to not realize that in addition to having a neat application or solid resume, residents needed to present themselves well. They needed to practice interviewing. They needed hair cuts, professional-looking clothes appropriate to the job, well-done (not overdone) makeup and nails. They needed to know how to research companies to find the best fit. There's a lot more to getting a decent job that submitting an online application, but staff at many shelters don't seem to know that.
10ucl28,,j7dpz9y,This may seem like a "duh," especially in San Antonio, but please have several employees in your program who speak Spanish. I'm in Dallas, and the shelter I was in had no one who spoke Spanish, which is nuts.
10ucl28,,j7etnp7,Wow, yeah that is crazy considering how many of us there are with Spanish roots!
10ucl28,,j7cucz6,Thank you. This is very helpful.
10ucl28,j7d6jyq,,I‚Äôd be happy to answer questions in text format.   My bandwidth is spotty at best.  Even at the shelter.   I‚Äôll be there in 2 hours if you want to send me some questions  that I can answer at my leisure.   Shelter is crazy til lights out.  ü§™

10u9fnp,j7am40h,,Note : only recommend if you are desperately hungry and not visiting the same hotel everyday every week.  Try not to walk out with food either on the radar.  I‚Äôm recommending a normal serving.  Like not grocery shopping.  Walk in. Be low key. Try to blend.
10u9fnp,j7amlrf,,The construction crew advice is great. You are less suspicious if your clothes are a little rugged and have a bag. Also, a yellow vest is easy to found, don't take space and can make you invisible in a lot of aera.
10u9fnp,,j7amwnh,I‚Äôve had homeless come to my hotel.  I don‚Äôt mind giving out some food under the radar.  Most night audit people don‚Äôt like people.  So we‚Äôve are kind of outcasts ourselves. Homeless people can also be friends.  I gave one lady an art kit because she gave awesome conversation.  We like to people on a small level as long as you aren‚Äôt creepy or shady as fk.    This also works if you are homeless in a car.  Stay in the parking lot and just leave before management shows up.  Just don‚Äôt give night audit any shit and there‚Äôs a network of Allies to make
10u9fnp,,j7ao4wt,Also let me add :  it‚Äôs 6 am it‚Äôs the END of night audits day.  We don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone lol let alone engage with customers at the end of our day.

10u9fnp,j7b3okg,,Was sitting in a hotel one morning at a job I used to have two guys sit down and cross from me in the breakfast area wearing the safety vests. They are eating waffles omelettes everything available and we begin to talk, I noticed they are literally eating like they haven't eaten in a week.   About an hour later I had to go to a job site and they were walking down the road with all of their stuff stopped at the red light they looked over at me and gave me the thumbs up.

10u9fnp,j7oyk48,,Where I work, there's a little hot box with the sort of food you'd expect at a gas station, and at 8pm every night, what's left is supposed to be thrown away according to corporate policy.  But my store manager says as long as you don't cook too much with the intention of taking it, you're allowed to take the leftovers home. There's people that come in sometimes that are a bit down on their luck, and know that if I'm working the 2-10 shift, I'll put some of the food in a bag for them (depending on how much is left, I may take a few things for myself)
10u8wr8,j7ayryb,,While it is honorable to help your friends and disabled people, you were never in a position to do so. You did anyway, and now you're here. It sucks, but sometimes you have to realize what you're limits are and stay within them. I understand throwing a hail-mary to avoid homelessness, but it didn't work.   There are no real rules to how life is supposed to be. And since we are all too lazy to organize and take our lives back from the psychopaths that run the world, here we are. This is just another stage in your life, albeit not a great one.  Adapt. That's all you can do.
10u8wr8,j7b8fwq,,I wish you luck! I have been in a similar situation with roommates.

10u8wr8,j7bfqlg,,So you have a 2k apartment with how many bedrooms?
10u8wr8,,j7cfrpd,2 bed 2 bath. Although honestly the second bedroom is where my friend sleeps and it is not much bigger than a closet.
10u8wr8,,j7cj047,I mean, one way to troubleshoot is take an inventory of your assets and see what your options are.   -Can you sell your car to buy some time? -Since your friend is not paying rent, can your friend move out so you can rent that bedroom for 750 to 1000? They could go to a shelter? Or move in with Friends/family? It‚Äôs unfair for you to be their primary caretaker with your current situation.  -If you can‚Äôt move your friend out of the second bedroom, maybe move them into the living room and try to rent the 2nd bedroom. The 2nd bedroom will fetch a lower price because you don‚Äôt have common space with your friend in the living area, and you also will lose common space but it‚Äôs better than losing your own housing potentially.  Although I‚Äôm not sure this is possible before you lose your place on Tuesday, you might want to be proactive and discuss a payment plan with your landlord on Monday. You really don‚Äôt want an eviction on your record, it will be extremely difficult to rent another place for many years to come.   You might even consider moving into your car and renting out your own bedroom to keep an eviction off your record. Discuss sublease options with your landlord.  If you do end up getting evicted, you‚Äôre going to want to hold onto your car. So I‚Äôd focus on paying your car bills if an eviction is inevitable to make sure your car doesn‚Äôt get repossessed. Look into subreddits on car living or van life. If the payments are high, look into selling your car and buying something that is cheaper.   Hope this helps.
10u8wr8,,j7cjpnk,It is helpful though to say the least I have already thought of all of these things before. I'm already on a payment plan for missing Decembers rent and i don't believe they will just let me keep tacking on the bill. Craigslist is for murders not doin that, and to find someone in 2 days is unlikely anyway.
10u8wr8,,j7ck78k,I would say the more drastic measures of subleasing your own bedroom or kicking your friend out need to be taken then unfortunately or you‚Äôll have an eviction on your record.
10u8wr8,,j7mqxgg,I‚Äôve found and posted numerous fine housing options on CL. Check the sublet section.
10u8wr8,j7ip725,,Contact your local county's housing department right away during daylight hours. You need to get in contact with a social worker. Most county services can probably refer you to emergency eviction prevention that helps for one or two months. Try calling United Way's 2-1-1 number or their [211.org](https://211.org) website. The service should be able to direct you to localized services, both public and private with rental assistance.  You may find help with emergency rent assistance, depending on your locality, from listings at [https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental\_assistance\_near\_you.html](https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/html/rental_assistance_near_you.html).
10u7kem,j7alkzm,,I'm not considered employable until I get housing. So I'm on disability and a 2 to 8 year wait list for housing.
10u7kem,,j7bt5dp,So, this is the biggest one for me.   I gave a guy a dollar one day outside a sandwich shop and another customer called me out and told me not to do it. This guy said the homeless man should work for his money.   I pointed at the homeless man and said, "if you were a hiring manager would you hire him?" Customer quickly agreed the dude was definitely unemployable in his current condition. Guy was pretty rough, looked like he had been on the street a year.   I really think most people who look at the homeless and think, "why don't they work?" really have not just thought critically about the situation.
10u7kem,,j7cl6xp,yep, i tell people, the food and clothes are nice and all but can you give me a job?
10u7kem,,j7cpwul,Sorry, those are only for housed people. /s  I feel you. The truth is it's easier to look down on us and they need reasons that feel valid to them to do so, and therefore you *have* to be too lazy to work. If you weren't too lazy they might be forced to acknowledge the system is broken, but we can't have that.
10u7kem,,j7c1jtn,Exactly. I actually did work for several years while homeless,  but the amount of effort and cooperation needed to not appear homeless was overwhelming.  At first I had a district manager who gave me a key to come into work early. That allowed me to freshen up in the mornings and comfortably eat a hot breakfast before everyone else got to work. I was model employee.  But then management changed and some very stable genius type of guy with zero empathy for anyone without a golf club membership created chaos. He ultimately refused to honor my medical accommodations for work and that allowed me to qualify for welfare (Social Security Disability) after he fired me.
10u7kem,,j7drf8d,[deleted]
10u7kem,,j7dryfa,Don't want to. My original employers were very kind people who built their business from the ground up. They hired an outside specialist to help with expansion and he just didn't want to deal with me.
10u7kem,j7cu1mb,,Because I'm disabled, and I would need medical care that I can't seem to obtain in order to get to the point I could consistently do any kind of job.
10u7kem,j7daf2b,,I have a job; 2 in fact. I've had shelter for 6 months now, but I worked the entire time I was homeless. It's odd people still assume we don't work even though the housing market is bonkers, and you can still not have enough money to pay rent.   I think it fits the narrative they tell themselves as they lay down in their discontented bed, next to their indifferent spouse, waiting for another day at their miserable job.
10u7kem,,j7elclq,I agree

10u7kem,,j7ceh9u,I don't think they are doing it to be mean, some people ruin it for others by using the bathrooms as a shooting gallery or a place to have sex.  That's when the locks go on the bathroom doors and the signs go up saying customers only.
10u7kem,,j7d4zc9,Oh I know it.  It‚Äôs my biggest issue with homelessness.  I wake up at the shelter at 630am.  Always 3 guys shooting in that bathroom.   We all go down to a breakfast place.   I can usually get a pee in there.  Then it‚Äôs off to the coffee shop that has barred us all from the bathrooms.    Library also guards the bathroom.   More than 30 seconds and the guard is unlocking the door so everyone can see the throne.   It‚Äôs much less stressful to just shit outside the coffee shop.   They can deal with the hygiene issue.   Not my fault.   I‚Äôm not an addict.    I spend almost $300 a month there.   Well, I used to.   Now they only get my poo
10u7kem,,j7cqqg1,Stash your bag somewhere and go in
10u7kem,,j7d49z8,I look very distinct. They‚Äôd turn me away.  I‚Äôm just shitting outside in their dumpster corral now.  Went *smoothly* today.
10u7kem,,j7d4gf3,Shit.
10u7kem,,j7d5b72,Quite.
10u7kem,j7aeae5,,Say you have a trust fund
10u7kem,,j7agazr,"I invested in crypto back in the days"
10u7kem,j7dx951,,I am not homeless but honestly you are living the life you want to live, unless you aren't \*shrug\* Maybe you have a hard time getting a job, maybe people want to know your situation I don't know. Some people are honest with their questions and some people are trying to be judgmental. If you have trouble getting a job there needs to be a network that can help you, I wanted to work on something like that but I am having trouble finding people who want to help me with a network like that. Anyone interested in working towards this goal? I have a house and looking for a partner in my mission on helping people out eventually, but it will take time.
10u7kem,j7ehdbq,,If I didn‚Äôt have a job before being homeless, I doubt I would now. Even if you can secure a job, sleep deprivation will  be enough to keep you unemployed. Not too mention, everyone you work with will know your homeless. And probably will treat you like dirt!
10u7kem,j7b05ed,,I tell them the truth. I do work sometimes, if it suits me, or I need to. But I'm done working to make other people rich while I scrape by.
10u7kem,,j7ce35x,How will you support yourself when you are older?
10u7kem,,j7cnbvj,Probably social security, which isn't much. Maybe the world will end - doubtful. Honestly I don't really care. Hopefully some social program will get me through between the time I can't work and death. Who knows? I might die on these streets.   I do have a tendency to fall into what I need when I need it. I've turned down more opportunity than most people ever see. It seems to be a byproduct of unshackling my self from all the fear and usual bullshit people chain themselves to just because someone told them they had to.
10u7kem,,j7gkpek,That‚Äôs really sad to hear
10u7kem,j7bsoqr,,This very much depends on the person asking.   Match their tone. If they seem sympathetic and sincere tell the truth; if they seem judgemental then give a sarcastic answer.   Or just say, "rude."
10u7kem,j7e1ppa,,It is a legitimate question. One of the homeless service centers here has a van from the daily pay labor pool show up every morning. On Saturday and Sundays the area has green markets with vendors that always could use some help. At the end of the month you can post up at Ryder or Uhaul and have work in less than an hour.  I would rather work a couple days of the week than:  1. Wait 3 hours to take a timed 20 minute shower. A Planet Fitness membership allows you to take a shower whenever you want for as long as you want.  2. Wait an hour in line for a meal. With a bit of money and restaurant apps, you can eat well.
10u7kem,j7fdfi7,,I guess the best reply would be something like: "Well read up on the entire issue of homelessness and you'll have a close enough idea."
10u7kem,j7d0fe9,,"How do you work"  Not an easy question. Many don't have a car. I do, but it needs many repairs, so stuck. Thought about selling it or trade it for a used camper. Tired of paying my SS check out on rent, utilities and groceries.  Getting hard to find work online to do. I did some of it in the past.  I have a house for now. They go up on this rent again, I will be out in the streets. I call it, "Going Rambo," when you do homeless.  I have my early SS check of 1300 a month to deal with this mess. That money follows me anywhere I want to go. I want to go back home to Cherokee NC, Gatlinburg- Pigeon Forge area.  I go back, find part-time work there with SS, I will get back on my feet alone.  I wonder anyone else like to join me on that journey? That is the place people borrow, beg and steal for little vacations in the Smokies.  Plenty of jobs there but the issue. a home is the problem.
10u5t0f,j7a75k9,,Also depending if you're a queer person or not and if you happen to be up to you 24 then the lesbian and gay Center in West Hollywood will probably help you. That's it definitely was not around when I turned into an adult or at the very least that type of assistance wasn't available yet.
10u5t0f,j7a6r7m,,Also the above is kind of me trying to answer the question while also complaining a tiny amount the tiniest amount of complaining.lol
10u5t0f,j7eapwn,,It's nice that they are beautifying the city, maybe they aren't thinking of the homeless population or actively discouraging it. I guess y'all could always try to find another headquarters to group up at. I don't know, like I've been trying to work on a project to help but I know sometimes being homeless is a culture of it's own too. It's sad that the city is changing for you, it's hard to say who is right here because for one being homeless causes some filth on the streets and garbage and then also sometimes those places are the most comfortable spots to be in. The benches were usually there for pedestrians and older people who have trouble getting around, they weren't intended to be slept on. I wish instead of changing things to be discouraging they would actually work to help you out. I am trying to see what I can do but it's really hard for a lot of people right now, and I don't have a lot of resources but I've offered my home to a few people that never made it here because they decided to do something else.
10u3ieg,j7aryd4,,That is awesome to know will be sharing this. I have used www.petsofthehomeless.com which has free vet care, free crates, and free food donation spots. For food go on website and put city or zip code and donation sites pop up. For crates and vet care you have to call them. They are in Nevada and help anywhere in U.S. and parts of Canada. They are open 9-3pm but remember time difference when you call. I used to call 1-3pm my time EST to talk to anyone. They paid for my cat to have an operation to remove a tumor from his ear. They also have lots of resources. Hope your site and mine help lots of people. Thank you for sharing this resource.
10u3ieg,j7ctsyx,,This is an excellent referral to a resource. I will incorporate that into this forum's comprehensive guide in a upcoming update. Thank you for posting it.
10tvpfj,j79emef,,I been homeless since september  And i wish i was dead.   Last time i was homeless it was 2 years  In 2016 . . .  I wanted to jump of a high bridge But then God anssered my prayers and i was able to find a cheap rental and things got better  Once i started making money.  But now i hit rock bottom again and  Im living in my vehicle fighting deppression  And crazy thoughts.     Life is Hell for me.   So i tottally understand.   DM ME.
10tvpfj,j79eumq,,I have not but I readily would take the hot showers and food and a bed over being outside.
10tvpfj,j79v4no,,I tried multiple times when I was homeless but the hospital wouldn't take me
10tvpfj,j7b80io,,> my friends seem unable to understand anything im going through and my suicidal urges and depression have deteriorated my few remaining relationships.  Are you getting treatment right now? If you're suffering suicidal urges (making you a danger to yourself) you should go to the hospital. It's a good way to start treatment if you're not getting that.  > is that a remotely ok idea or will i end up abused even more and more suicidal?  You've been hospitalized before so you know the answer to this. Two of my family members were hospitalized for mental illness and neither of them suffered abuse.
10tvpfj,j795ga9,,Not voluntarily, no. I would walk around with an abrus flower behind my ear. I think the proximity to the threat helped me get through it. That, and finding enjoyment in giving the city hell for the shit they put us through.
10tvpfj,j7q2jl3,,I have several times. I just tell the er intake nurse that I feel like I'm going to hurt myself tonight or others. They usually move you into a secure room quickly. From there I've been in hospitals for 3 days before I was discharged to being in one for a month before I was "ready" to leave.
10ttbyx,j78ndiw,,In the confessions of a North Korean defector, he stated that he was happier in North Korea because he knew all of his neighbors, rather than the daily grind of chasing after the vanity like they did in the South. Of course, they were also less likely to say things freely around one another for fear of getting reported.  Neighborhoods typically aren't designed around bench tables for people to come out and share bread. Well, unless you're homeless. According to the end part of [Luke 10], the servers at a restaurant that sit down to listen to their guests have the better part, rather than those who try to look busy getting more water.  Communities like this exist today. In Israel, they are called a kibbutz. Your labor is to the benefit of everyone, and what you own is held in common. What exists in America with tent cities attempts to start down this path, where neighbors know one another and learn to trust and watch their things when they leave. Unfortunately, they fail to gain traction and unity for a variety of reasons. Either NIMBY destruction of camps, or a lack of land, resources, and knowledge.
10ttbyx,j7i0pl6,,Agree in parts
10tqc62,j789xvr,,They don't know where to put them.   A few men's shelters I stayed at occasionally had a trans. Mtf and it was never easy for the employees
10tqc62,j7a7jny,,I'm sorry for your experience. I think it's hard on shelters to accommodate this when they barely have enough space separating men and women. It works out very difficult for trans people :-(
10tqc62,j78e24d,,It's a safety thing. We actually had a couple of trans women in the women's shelter I was in and it didn't go well. The shelter is a place of abuse for a lot of women to begin with. Being trans makes that 100x worse because a lot of the women there don't see trans women as legitimately female and they will bully them, refuse to share a dorm or bathroom with them. It shouldn't be that way but it unfortunately it is.
10tqc62,,j7cg3l5,Everyone talks about the idea of women bullying transwomen in the shelters but nobody talks about transwomen bullying women in the shelters because it doesn‚Äôt want to cross their mind that this happens. Between late November last year and January that‚Äôs exactly what happened in my shelter room with two different people. Not to mention hogging the bathroom for hours that has to be shared by 10 people in the room to ‚Äútuck their penis‚Äù. It begs the question of why someone with a penis should be given more rights in a women‚Äôs shelter. Not to mention threatening to beat people up and mace people twice in the same day right in front of the administration. Not to mention the racism by the second one, 3 weeks ago, toward an Asian room member who was called an ugly Chinese bitch everyday (but if she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not really a woman‚Äù that‚Äôs discrimination huh) all because she told them not to smoke in the bathroom which is against the laws of the city. Despite them literally threatening to get a friend to come to the shelter and beat her up or kill her the next day. I recorded that on video and what did the front office do? Nothing but coddle. But people draw the line when an elderly, disabled woman accidentally says ‚Äúhe‚Äù.   There are other transwomen here who have no issues with anybody because they‚Äôre kind, not violent and malicious toward people.
10tqc62,,j78yjbf,What about transmen? I know even though I‚Äôve  been on hrt they wouldn‚Äôt put me in with  the males because I didn‚Äôt have bottom surgery. And they wouldn‚Äôt let me in the women‚Äôs shelter and be on hrt because it is a control substance. I would have to be called by my legal name  and female pronouns. Or they wouldn‚Äôt let me in. So I found another place. But boy was it hard to get a place.
10tqc62,,j78yxd3,Same thing. Trans people are more at risk of violence and rejection, period. They will go by the genitals you have and put you in a shelter accordingly. Some places are more progressive and have special shelters for LGBTQ people but that's still not the norm unfortunately.
10tqc62,,j7900kl,But they rejected me even if I accepted just to have a place to stay. It‚Äôs either no hrt and stay or if I take hrt can‚Äôt stay. And the shelter would be according to my birth sex. Yet they denied me anyways because I took testosterone.
10tqc62,,j791qid,Your looking more and more like the opposite gender but not exactly being the one you were born can lead to some serious bullying and potential violence. It's cruel if you ask me but they think they are doing it to protect you. Trans people are the subject of a lot of violence in and out of shelters but it can be bad in them.   We had two trans male to female people and one who was transitioning to male in my women's shelter which was for people with mental issues, addiction issues, and physical disability. All 3 of them went through absolute hell because the women in the shelter did not accept them and bullied them, even beat on them trying to get them out of the shelter. It was a constant fight especially when it came to sharing bathrooms.   In a perfect world you would be able to be wherever you felt the most comfortable but we don't live in a perfect world and though their way is wrong headed it's just how it is in a lot of places for now.   I was amazed that they even allowed the folks with male genitals in at all honestly. But either way it did not go well and all of these Trans people ended up really enduring a lot of abuse all round. Being homeless sucks in general but being LGBTQ and homeless is practically hell on Earth.   Sorry...  ü§óü§óü§ó
10tqc62,,j794raq,And what makes it worse is my voice confuses people.  I do look like a regular guy. But when I was on the phone calling for a place. They thought I was joking. So I had to repeat myself so they understand that i really we female at birth. Passing and having a deep bass baritone voice is good and all, but when it comes to other things not so great. But thank you for understanding
10tqc62,j7ozu3s,,The last month I was homeless, I was in a Salvation Army shelter, and with my now ex (a trans guy). Since he is still legally female, he was on the ladies side of the shelter. I'm not sure if they could have put him on the men's side if he was legally male- maybe?  The people that knew he was trans didn't seem to give any fucks, and he never got any hate that I know of. But that's just in my area, it could be different in another place.
10tqc62,,j7rlpfm,Ok good to know.
10tqc62,j7cecf1,,Where I work we accept trans clients, they‚Äôre allowed to choose which shelter they feel most comfortable in.  We current have two MTF guests and they‚Äôre doing really well, we surprisingly don‚Äôt have really any issues with this (given the blatant homophobia and misogyny a lot of our guests have, both men and women).  A lot of the ladies are very concerned for their comfort and safety.  This is against the norm though - this is not the case for most shelters.  I hate to have to do it, but I generally suggest to clients might want to go to the shelter that they ‚Äúpass‚Äù better in.  Which is a horrible term and I make it clear it‚Äôs not coming from a place of my transphobia, but just trying to keep them safe in a rocky environment.  Again, we‚Äôve had no issues which is great but it‚Äôs obviously always a concern.
10tqc62,j796eum,,Are you talking about folks with a tallywacker pretending to be girls??? Let them sleep outside, please.

10tqc62,,j79k44v,Can you name more
10tqc62,,j79kjn1,I think this is best left to my religious and spiritual adviser Maybelle "Sugarfoot" Tishmallow. Would you care to zoom meet with her? I don't debate with folks who have the penis ( no offence)
10tqc62,,j79kpmt,I just asked questions, and you didn‚Äôt give any answers. You could‚Äôve just said you don‚Äôt want to answer ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù
10tqc62,,j79l9qa,Are you ready accept Sugarfoot as your spiritual mentor?? You sound like ur in pain
10tqc62,,j79y7r1,Why was my comment deleted? I just said my opinion. You don‚Äôt have to agree. But I respect your opinion.
10tqc62,j79ni4m,,Because nobody is forced to believe in ur interpretation of reality. Not every 6 yr old that believes he‚Äôs Batman is allowed to join the Justice League.
10tqc62,,j7eezs8,That was cruel. You are transphobic POS.
10tqc62,,j79yrlj,So you don‚Äôt see them as men? That‚Äôs fine you have a Right to your religious belief. Transmen  can‚Äôt go in the mens shelters. They have to Go to the women‚Äôs.  Because most don‚Äôt have surgery. Transmen we‚Äôre AFAB‚Ä¶Meaning born female but have a male identity. Even if they can‚Äôt be adress as men. Why can‚Äôt they just  be in a private room and still be on hrt?
10tqc62,,j79z5i1,Nobody said anything about religion. Its a biological fact. Ur a biological female. No amount of drugs or lies can ‚Äúturn‚Äù u into the opposite sex. If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm a monkeys uncle.
10tqc62,,j79zx7k,Exactly I‚Äôm a biological female who is with a male identity. I know I will never be able to change my chromosomes. But just so you know.. that‚Äôs not what transitioning is about. It‚Äôs about feeling comfortable in the body you feel that fits most. And it‚Äôs not a trauma thing either. It‚Äôs just feels right. And i pre fur that life. I take hrt to help my dysphoria. Now mentally I see myself as a man.
10tqc62,,j7a0a8l,Mental illness; If u can‚Äôt get into a men‚Äôs shelter bc ur a bio female is just what it is. Nothing u can do but either go to the women‚Äôs or sleep outside.
10tqc62,,j7a0vif,I‚Äôm not homeless now but was. This post was my experience as a trans person on how hard it was to find a place. And I also mentioned the woman‚Äôs shelter wouldn‚Äôt let me take hrt. But that‚Äôs because of it being a control substance. Even if prescribed by a doctor. It‚Äôs fine  though because at least I have a place  now.
10tqc62,,j7a4g5c,Does your mommy know you're using her smartphone?
10tqc62,,j7a51nr,U must have no counter argument so u immediately run to insults
10tqc62,j78kt0a,,If the shelter is denying you hrt, it's a rehab program not a shelter.  So many of these places are set up as an arm of local government to create good worker slaves.
10tqc62,,j790cvh,I guess it was a rehab? But I‚Äôm not an alcoholic. And I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs
10tp2ss,j780xwq,,I don't know how most of those shelter work, but it is always more difficult for a woman to stay in a regular shelter full of mens, even if they are rooms/aera for women. This is not like if mens can't go in a regular shelter, it make sense to segregate. If you have shelter for 45+ yo, or drug addicts, etc, it should also make sense. Womens are more at risk on the streets and if you have childrens, you should feel safer for them if you are surrounded by womens.
10tp2ss,,j79ae5n,Very true. Women on the street are at very high risk. And in the shelters it is not much better. They need to be separate.
10tp2ss,,j786fdz,there are literally no shelters with only 'regular men' anyways. that is literally the point op is making.
10tp2ss,,j7a023o,there are tons of mens only shelters and men only transition houses out there. there might be less of them than womens shelters but there still are men only shelters.
10tp2ss,,j7czmq3,There aren't even less of them than women's shelters.
10tp2ss,,j7czjpt,Yes, there are.   My uncle lived in one for years in a city that had no shelter for women. We talked frequently about how they just assumed there were no homeless women, but they were technically correct. All the homeless women from that town went to the next one over for services.
10tp2ss,,j78dq50,But why regular men want to go in those shelters? You have to be desperate.
10tp2ss,,j79ocie,Of course they are desperate if they need a safe place to stay
10tp2ss,,j78mvo2,They're homeless. they have nowhere else to go. the only shelter options they have is sleeping 50-men to a room. No safety, no privacy, no decency. Too close proximity and too many people in one room means more outbursts and arguments and lice and bed bugs and theft. 50 people to a room??? Even DOG SHELTERS wouldn't put 50 dogs in the same room. this is disgusting.  Homeless men are treated inhumanely in comparison to everyone else who experiences homelessness. Like criminals or animals of sorts. JUST because they were born the wrong gender.  This is NOT equality. This is discrimination based on gender.
10tp2ss,,j7ahp5d,Discrimination is not to blame for this, it is simply the lack of wealth the government puts in
10tp2ss,,j8hw0nw,there are more women than men on food assistance programs.  so what did we do? did we tell 50 women to share ONE pack of ramen noodles? Like a bunch of sadists?  or did we simply increase funding to add more food? WE SIMPLY INCREASED FUNDING BECAUSE NO HUMAN DESERVES TO SUFFER.  You know what? Maybe you're right... maybe your sadistic idea is better.. let's make 50 women fight over a pack of ramen, while every man gets his own pack... it's not discrimination, right?  smdh.
10tp2ss,,j7a8ptb,I get that, bet even sleeping in an underground parking, a building hall, anything is better and safer.
10tp2ss,,j7cyv6x,Yes but they would have euthanized the dogs if there wasn't enough room. Thankfully they haven't started trying to euthanize us... Yet.
10tp2ss,,j7bseyc,Don't you see, though? How you are lumping all men with criminals? EVEN THE MEN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF CRIME!!!  This is wrong, my friend. Wrong. Please listen to what you are saying. Replace "men" with any other group.... white, black, women, jews, budhists, muslims, blind people, deaf people.... any other group that did not choose how they were born... and you will see how horrible what you said sounds.  Segregation is never the answer. If there are bad people, they need to be kept out. But keeping ALL MEN OUT, BASED ON GENDER, even those who were victims of abuse, is the worst kind of cruelty and discrimination.
10tp2ss,,j7cz74b,If a man has his children he should be allowed  into a family shelter. Single adults should not be in family shelters with children.
10tp2ss,,j7e4n0a,Men with children are allowed in family shelters. Usually the only requirement is having kids, they don't all allow single women as OP suggests.
10tp2ss,j78qm5j,,It's dangerous for women and children to be at men's shelters.   I went to day services at the men's shelter and it looked like Mad Max.   Some places have really nice facilities for the homeless, but most are just warehouses for broken people.
10tp2ss,,j78tkbh,the type of shelters designed for single men with 50+ to a room are conducive to crime. They're not safe for anyone. The proof is that millions of single men feel safer sleeping outside all around the world every night.
10tp2ss,,j78uche,I'm one of them. Much safer to sleep outside than in a shelter.
10tp2ss,,j78uswz,I lasted a month in a shelter at 18 and noped the fuck out. I would have rather froze to death or hit by a car rather than stay in those places. True hives of scum and villainy
10tp2ss,,j7a8ihb,why you say they that? violence? rape? theft? at the shelters?
10tp2ss,,j7b7v8l,In the United States at least, yes, there are a lot of assaults, theft, conflicts, bed bugs, lice, communicable diseases, mental illness, and drug addiction in the shelters. Plus, from what I understand a lot of them have a curfew, so if you work a job that keeps you out late, you can't sleep there.
10tp2ss,,j7evtys,The curfew bit makes me the most upset. Especially in places where it gets down to freezing at night and the factories are only hiring for second shift, 3-11 pm.   It's one thing to have a curfew for the unemployed, but how do you not accommodate employed people?   My uncle had trouble with this for awhile before he was able to get an apartment.
10tp2ss,,j7brpqa,As exactly the other response said. Assault, lice, uncontrolled mental illness, random theft and more general dangers
10tp2ss,,j7coqly,This is good to know because I'm in the process of starting a pallet home type of shelter in Moreno Valley
10tp2ss,,j7ct872,I am going to take a wild guess that you went to a men's shelter.
10tp2ss,,j78wktz,I second this. A lot of it is tailored for communal living.  Which usually isn't a good idea. Because you get caught up in other people's drama.
10tp2ss,,j7aiuuj,Will another homeless person discover you sleeping outside?  In San Francisco it might be hard to find a place to sleep peacefully.
10tp2ss,,j7ajdd1,I'm sleeping on someone's back porch/deck now in a North Carolina immigrant slum, so that's a small comfort. Still in a tent though.  But I was a bushwhacker before this. Searched public records for abandoned lots. Used a machete and briar busters to access places that people haven't set foot in for decades.
10tp2ss,,j7ajtjx,In a city with a low homeless population it would be easy to find a places that nobody goes to. But in a high homeless place the homeless looking for good places will explore so it might be hard to find a place where nobody will discover you sleeping.  I am glad you have a friend letting you stay on their porch.
10tp2ss,,j7akh89,There's a big difference between the homeless population and the squatter population.  My city has half a million people in it but I learned from the squatters. They can get into places most homeless people wouldn't think of.
10tp2ss,,j7cs76c,I looked at your profile because your story sounded strangely familiar to mine.  Sure enough.. another aspie. smh... you do realize this is the reason you are struggling with housing, right?  You did not do anything wrong. You are not a bad person. You did not fail. You are not a Pariah. You are not antisocial. The majority of us end up in that situation. Statistics demand that you are exactly where you are in life. Once again, discrimination.  what's your thought about my post in general?
10tp2ss,,j7ctin5,I'm still curious if you've actually firsthand experienced a homeless shelter.
10tp2ss,,j7czse8,>They can get into places most homeless people wouldn't think of.                     Could you go into this some more please?
10tp2ss,,j7dofn2,Yeah, it's really simple. The right gear and know-how can get you into places most homeless people wouldn't bother with.   First thing is a machete to cut through a wall of bushes. Most people walk past the same thick bushes for years never ever thinking to turn and walk into them. Just pull out your machete and starting whacking through bush no one has touched in decades. Kukhuris are the most portable machetes I know of.   Need the right gear to get thru the bush.  Homeless people are wearing casual pants and t-shirts. Squatters are wearing leather or thick duck overalls and coveralls made out of heavier materials. I liked wearing hunting overalls from Walmart. That allows squatters to move through briar patches that'll tangle most homeless people. And cops.   Cops hate going into the bush. I sat and watched them struggle with the stuff searching for people. They hate it.  Leg gaiters are funny things. I put them on with waterproof Mickey Mouse boots and waterproof hunting overalls and they somehow create an air pocket that allows me to stay dry while wading in creeks. I don't how it works but it does.  So most homeless people would be stopped by a creek or pool of water. But you can just stomp through it with leg gaiters and briar busters to access places homeless people don't want to deal with.
10tp2ss,,j7czliw,>Searched public records for abandoned lots              I would have never thought to do this. Genius.   How do you go about doing this, generally speaking as States probably vary.
10tp2ss,,j7dmk6e,I came across a really big list of individuals who were late on their property taxes. State governments don't mind publishing that information when you owe them money.  Then a lot of counties are using GIS (Graphical Information Systems) to track properties and utilities.   So I search for the people who owe the most money on the GIS.   A lot of people were dead. There we're businesses that went out of business or bankrupt. A lot of properties were junk lots, like in a flood plain or landlocked with no easement for access. The legal battle for landlocked properties makes people and inheritors just abandon them.  So I go through the delinquent tax properties and keep a list of whatever might be useful. Then eventually check them out in person or refer the property to someone who needs to disappear.
10tp2ss,,j7aimrk,Men are not safe from other men. We should give homeless people including men safer places to sleep than 50 to a room shelters.  Sleeping with 50 men in my room is probably safer than sleeping with 4 men in my room. I would rather sleep in a ‚Äúyouth hostel‚Äù with 8 middle aged men that came there for the hiking trails then sleep in a room with 8 homeless 2 of whom are nuts and all of whom are stressed out by homelessness.
10tp2ss,,j799jto,‚Äúit‚Äôs dangerous for women and children to be at men‚Äôs shelters‚Äù  COMPLETE and utter sexist bullshit
10tp2ss,,j79ass1,I don't know what to tell you. Maybe you should write a poem about it and try to work thru those feelings. We're in survival mode over here.
10tp2ss,,j7a2z90,It is Extremely sexist.  They are grouping all men with the 0.2% that are rapists and murderers. And they are justifying it in their delusional minds that this is somehow NOT discrimination.  It's a disgusting display of hypocrisy.
10tp2ss,j7876ia,,From what I have seen there are more shelters for men most places than for women, and family shelters are even rarer and hard to get in to.
10tp2ss,,j79t9p8,Lol, where do you stay that there's an abundance of men's shelters?
10tp2ss,,j79w04z,Not an abundance, just more than the others.
10tp2ss,,j7d03jt,I think that's because there are more services available to get housing for single parents with children.
10tp2ss,j7a799a,,I think the way Homeless shelters are modeled and run overall needs to be reformed and updated. I think there would be less need to segregate if the conditions were better within the shelter. Like more space for more rooms and bigger buildings with additional floors that maybe could be could be segregated that way. Everyone should have a safe, clean place to go. While there does need to be shelters specifically for women and children  just because of higher risk and those who are fleeing domestic abuse situations. The focus doesn't always need to be on that and I can see how that ends up happening. Moving forward when creating new shelters the focus should be on providing clean, safe spaces for all who need it and their pets.      There is a great new shelter that just opened up here in my county they accept anyone regardless of gender and pets! It's run by a Anti-poverty Fellow at a local university who has been an amazing advocate for the homeless over the years. She treats people with respect and dignity and understands there is more to helping people then just providing a space to sleep or eat. Which is why the shelter is also going to have a floor that provides wrap around services to help people with whatever they need whether it be health/mental health services, helping people get benefits and/or job programs etc... she also partnered up with some of the businesses in the community to come in and provide free services like haircuts from a local barber. She's pretty much removed any barrier she legally could to allow as many people possible to have access.      Which brings me to another major issue. The barriers to even accessing shelter for anyone are ridiculous and far too difficult.  Here in my county all of the shelters are gatekept by the non profit organization the county made responsible for handling our CoC. No one can access anything without going through them first and they have a habit of regularly turning people away. You have to basically fight to get any help and that's when you DO qualify for help. Anyone on drugs (even marijuana) or who has a criminal record ( no matter how minor or old the offense) automatically doesn't.  Unfortunately the need for shelter is great here so all the shelters remain full on a regular basis. When this happens they will pay for you to stay in a motel but only for a limited amount of time, 2 weeks. Then they will literally say fuck you you're SOL. It happened when I was homeless not only did I have to fight to even get any help for a month after being turned away the first time. They paid for a motel for two weeks ( I was homeless with my disabled mother and dog for 4 months). Even when cried on the phone with them having a panic attack telling them that we would die on the street, nothing. The way the homeless are perceived in this country is a disgrace systemically. Which is why the government services are usually terrible and ineffective.
10tp2ss,j78b5rd,,I was in a shelter for women and kids a couple of years ago. The organization that ran that shelter also had a shelter for men. It was bigger, nicer and better maintained, and the services and food were much better than what the women got. And, yeah, the residents were "regular men."  It may seem like there is less shelter for homeless men because y'all make up about make up 75% of the homeless population. Some groups put it as high as 84%. In many communities, there are 2-3 times more beds for men than women and kids. Depends on where you are. But the problem is, there are too many of you and not enough beds.  (FYI, I found all of this info through nonprofits, so I didn't make it up and it didn't come from the government.)
10tp2ss,,j78xp64,>But the problem is, there are too many of you and not enough beds.  This is what we call a logical falacy argument.  A lot more women receive food stamps and benefits than men do.  Should we just cut women's benefits in half to meet the same as mens resources, and say "Well... the problem is there are just too many of you and not enough food in the program." ??  No. WE MAKE SURE THEY EAT AND GET WHAT THEY NEED. BECAUSE THEY ARE HUMAN.  These special interest groups are apologist bigots, using false arguments to explain why they discriminate against single men.  History will expose and shame those people's bias one day. It will shame them real good. There are A LOT MORE men living on the streets, and men dying on the streets, and they are PURPOSELY discriminating against this whole group. It's absolutely hypocritical and unacceptable. Either help ALL YOUR LOCAL HOMELESS PEOPLE EQuaLLY, or Don't help ANY of them at all. Gender discrimination is unacceptable.  Shame on them.
10tp2ss,,j79mvlh,>logical falacy argument  Actually, no, that's not what you call a logical fallacy argument.  Yes, women get more food stamps and benefits than men because women more often have children, so they're not just feeding themselves. No one has cut the number of shelter beds for men. It's just that demand exceeds supply in some places. But it's the same for women. When I was in a shelter in Dallas, three women came up from Corpus Christi on a bus because there weren't enough rooms in shelters in that area. (FYI, they were all single Black women.)   I know nothing anyone says will convince you that you're not being discriminated against, so this is the last bit of time I'll waste on you. All I can suggest is for you to find the closest meeting of whatever misogynistic group is in your area and see if you can find someone who's willing to let you sleep on their couch and complain about women.
10tp2ss,,j79sc3c,Wage gap too, lawllll
10tp2ss,,j7a43k2,That's a good point. Hadn't thought about that. But, yeah, women make 84% of what men make. The gap is bigger in low-skill jobs.
10tp2ss,,j7axu0e,Just wanted to add that regardless of gender all our work is valid work.  Also, devils advocate that women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs shelters are solely biased and preferential- that‚Äôs only telling of the surrounding cons that outweigh the pros if one argues gender bias and not abuses that are inherently reciprocated and presently existing

10tp2ss,,j7a2kaq,homelessness is not any better in china or russia.  We can build skyscrapers in 10 months. We can easily build decent homeless shelters for men. This has nothing to do with any type of political system. It comes down to altruism and a community doing the right thing.
10tp2ss,,j7a3aol,The homelessness problem won't be solved until we have large scale political reform. Governments are protecting the interests of wealthy landowners instead of the common man. It's all politics
10tp2ss,,j7akhkv,Do you really know how homelessness is in Russia or China?  Homelessness might be better in Russia or China.  One of the things I saw in India was homeless people being allowed to form communities of hovel dwellers who were allowed to build their own hovels. Being part of a community of homeless people  gives some of the protection that comes from being part of a community and more dignity than the American homeless get; But I think it is easier for the American homeless to get food than it is for Indian homeless to get food.

Your past experiences is no excuse for acting like a bigot to people who had nothing to do with it and never hurt anybody.

10tp2ss,,j7c177s,[ Removed by Reddit ]
10tp2ss,,j7d16se,Most men are creeps is not true, your bias here is showing, if you experienced a lot of trauma that's understandable but a belief that most men are creeps speaks about the people you are around not men in general.                   The OP however is a gigantic ass. The only thing I will say is that as long as single fathers with children are at the shelter I have no pro men with it.  Shelters that cater to domestic violence victims and are publicly funded should have to assist male domestic violence victims as well but obviously keep the sexes separate.
10tp2ss,,j7eyq4w,Again‚Ä¶I work at a shelter.  You have no idea how many of the men, most of them, are absolute creeps.  Am I saying it means they shouldn‚Äôt have shelter, food, etc.?  No.  But the amount of times they‚Äôve gotten handsy, told female staff they‚Äôd rape them, etc.  One woman I work with got slugged in the face by a man who repeatedly told her how and when he‚Äôd rape her.  Most homeless women have been sexually assaulted.  56% of homeless women have been raped in comparison to 14% of men.  You cannot fault women who have been raped and abused by men being afraid of them and not want to be near them.  Did I say men shouldn‚Äôt have resources?  No, absolutely not.  Housing is a human right.  But you can‚Äôt say that women should just deal with it.  If I were suddenly homeless I would rather be on the street than surrounded with men I don‚Äôt know.

10tp2ss,,j7awehf,There are literally grants for college for non-white people. None of which have a white equivalent.
10tp2ss,,j7awj4r,What does college have to do with homeless shelters?  Whether it is smart or fair or not there is a defendable rational for giving minorities privileges at college (Especially blacks and native Americans). There would not be a defendable reason for giving minorities favoritism at homeless shelters so I doubt that minorities are getting privileges at homeless shelters.   Individual bigot shelter managers might dispense favors for their own race at a particular shelter but I bet that overall there is not discrimination against whites at shelters. Protecting women from men is something different.

You have to understand that they have no way of knowing who is a registered sex offender who can‚Äôt *legally* be around *children* and who isn‚Äôt when they enter the shelter. They‚Äôre already sending male-to-female transgender (who haven‚Äôt transitioned) to women‚Äôs shelters‚Ä¶ despite the fact that they literally physically threaten us‚Ä¶ cause no one cares about our safety either and it‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù to call them what they are: men with male anatomy posing as female so they don‚Äôt have to go to men‚Äôs shelters. You can call it discrimination but they‚Äôd rather shut single men out than potentially have serious rape and molestion allegations.
10tp2ss,,j79dnnm,Why do they insist on I'd if not to check the sex offender registry?
10tp2ss,,j7d2bei,The shelter near me actually checked the sex offender list but also required people to go to the local police and get a letter before you could stay saying you were not wanted and whether you were a sex offender or history of violence and any active restraining orders. This is waived for walk ins only on extremely cold nights but they stay on main floor near front desk. No one is denied because of their record it just helps staff manage things and watch higher risk guest's.

10tp2ss,j7biwsp,,Okay but wouldn't the solution be more men's shelters? Unfortunately if you have enough men in one place the odds are that at least one of them is not safe for women to be around. Should women and children have nowhere safe to go? And you can't exclude the unsafe men if they've never been caught and put on record, so that's just giving each of them one chance to assault someone.

10tp2ss,,j7a8hd7,That's also how it's done in my city. The women's shelter is at a secret location and women get picked up to be taken there.   The men's shelter has a day services building next to it for men, women and families. Anyone can walk in off the street for showers, laundry, medical care, internet and free coffee. Or just take advantage of the heat/air conoitioning.    There's a cafeteria in the back of the day services building. The men's shelter uses it on the weekdays but they have massive feasts on the weekends for everyone. Lot of good food served by various businesses. Sometimes a corporation or charity comes to the weekend feasts to hand out grab bags.  Downside:  The day services facility is always overcrowded. Long lines for showers, laundry or medical care. You gotta get there first thing in the morning to even make it on the wait list. Then you wait for hours with no guarantee of services.  It's normally predominantly men with about 3 or 4 women on the week days. But you'll see dozen's of women there on the weekend for the feast. There are family rooms but I've seen more famlies in the surrounding wooded areas than at the center. I've never seen the family rooms used.  I noticed a lot of guys were using the free internet to view adult content on their phones.
10tp2ss,,j79pnwp,In Florida, homeless men with custody of their children are not treated differently than women, and they are treated way better than women without children.   I have a male friend who is in and out of prison, and because he had kids he can't afford and has custody of them (along with his gf, who's a good mother, not a deadbeat - she's the one busting her ass working while he's always locked up), he gets medicaid, EBT, all that shit. Florida, like Texas, has no medicaid expansion.   So assuming a man has custody of his kids, even if he is not a single father, he is treated better than women without children in Florida and I'm sure in other states without Medicaid expansion as well, because having dependents matters.
10tp2ss,,j7a5qrm,I do not disagree, as I have seen a couple of single dads w kids, and they get sheltered pretty quick.  Howeverm as to the OPs post, single men do have it worse.

I gotta live out of a vehicle for the forseable future, but worse comes to worst, no way I'd stay in a shelter that allowed men.
10tnwkp,j77wu2t,,I‚Äôm gonna be real with you. The temperature outside is gonna kill me a lot quicker than the air quality.
10tnwkp,j77uvim,,Those are rookie numbers

10tnwkp,,j79eca9,LMAOO JUST BREATHE
10tfzv0,j76nm9g,,How did you get through the night in just that?  That low of a temperature would kill anyone else.
10tfzv0,,j79s0c3,I've only gone down to the teens. For that kinda weather (below freezing), I dig a deep hole and turn it into a fire pit.    The pit burns so hot that it looks like plasma. I've already gathered all the dead wood in the area. Cleaned it up nice and done the folks a favor. Burn it all to stay warm.
10tfzv0,,j78cc6t,This person most likely has a generator and a space heater.
10tfzv0,,j78vp9o,Being in the woods, I would say he made a fire to keep warm.
10tfzv0,,j791cts,Possible they did but that didn't keep them warm in the sleeping bag. Perhaps, if they were already warm, and this tent is somehow 1,000% windproof. Most tents aren't though..   Anyways the fire has to go out at night. But with a gen and a space heater you can keep that running at your liesure if you get too too cold.   My concern is winds and really just moving air. That air is -25, and when it exchanges with the air around you it's going to steal all your heat and replace it with -25¬∞ air.   Zippers are not literally wind proof (at least not the one on my sleeping bag) so yeah all in all I'm tryna get some details on how this person is addressing each individual issue that comes with being outdoor at these temps.   People mountain climbing will wear layers, AND do blankets plus sleeping bags and usually they have a rocket stove like situation, maybe pocket warmers etc. Etc.   The most important things are the feet and crotch, and the ears. But also, the more you resort to covering these up and not somehow airing them out the more disease and bacteria you can accumulate.   We're not all built the same either so.. yeah there's just a lot I want to know about OP and what they're doing
10tfzv0,j76lzys,,Brrr brrr brrr!  In my neck of the woods it's -28C, has been since last night.  -47C with windchill.  I am very very glad I don't have to be outside right now, and thankful to have some great cold weather gear if I did have to go out.
10tfzv0,j76ymta,,You are a trooper and an inspiration.  I hate shelters but winter scares me.
10tfzv0,,j79rguc,You have got to wear layers! I start with a t-shirt as a "base" and put on two hoodies and two pairs of sweat pants. That gets me down to 25F easily with a ski mask, but I like wearing a baklava better because it keeps the wind from going down my front! If I put on one more hoodie and one more pair of sweatpants, I am quite sure I could easily make it down to 10F. I could just literally find a dry place and fall asleep as long as I had something to put under my butt, lol.
10tfzv0,j77bvwg,,Congratulations on making it through, but you shouldn‚Äôt gamble with your life like that. All it takes is for your body temperature to take a nose dive, and your SOL. If you can try to find warm shelter if it gets into the negatives again.

10tfzv0,,j78ckf8,Need to know this.   I've had completely unlivable nights here just with the 35¬∞ wind chill and rain (sleeping bag only no tent). Wind in Frisco is relentless..  I'd like to know what this person is doing to get sleep in negative temperatures.
10tfzv0,,j78j6gj,could be multiple good  bags or one really good one.    In fact if you look there seems to be the shape of a smaller sleeping bag rather than legs.
10tfzv0,,j78jp6i,Word. I can't imagine what doing this consistently ends up smelling like.. ugh
10tfzv0,,j78xxj0,LOL a part of homelessness rarely talked about. my bag is good until -3 celcius but when its warm i sweat like a mother fucker. shit smells rancid.
10tfzv0,,j78y5nx,God help us. Even tea tree oil can't quite get you back from a few weeks of that   Yeah. Foot stuff is the worst. Also posture problems from sleeping in cramped setups.
10tfzv0,,j78yx56,it slightly helps to turn the bag inside out and let it air out when youre not using it. my back has gotten used to sleeping rough/cramped/on surfaces not meant for sleeping....... for now. i imagine a few years of that will do a real number on me medically eventually, but i doubt i will be alive to find out until then haha
10tfzv0,,j78zxus,I hope you are man. I spent my childhood sleeping wrong with shoes on, and then a couple months on/off sleeping outside at 14. The pain is not manageable for me today. My life has been at the point of, either do Yoga or die lost in the med system for about 7 years now. And I still have major issues especially with the bar in my chest which hurts like hell. Life's a real worthwhile thing when you're in good health.. usually   I hate hospitals, I don't want to go near them. I need the freedom to step outside, because if not I might get claustrophobic and agitated with all the robotic behavior around me. And then you end up in a psych ward and it is all downhill from there
10tfzv0,,j7905m7,ive been a known figure in my local psych ward. i am actually pretty fit and in shape, and i do care about my body and health. sadly i cannot do much more for it right now, but i hope i dont get ruined forever. cheers and thank you for sharing, it makes me feel less alone  edit: used to be a junkie not giving a shit about anything, im clean as fuck now and in best shape ive ever been, entirely ironically. just the going around all day carrying my shit (like ~30kg of crap) has made me ripped lol
10tfzv0,,j790ik5,Take care man best of luck to you ‚úäüëäüôè
10tfzv0,,j790e67,Well I understand the point of the psych ward enough to stay out of it. That is I have the emotional management to qualify me leaving about as soon as I show up to the ER  It still sucks though because there's no real help being offered. Either sink/swim or, get fucked in the system.
10tfzv0,,j79r8eh,It's not gonna get the funk off but you could buy a cheap spray bottle and fill it with rubbing alcohol. It'll at least kill the germs.
10tfzv0,,j79t1fd,I have no idea how bad I smell. Gotten so used to it.
10tfzv0,,j79svre,I'm on the other side of the country in North Carolina. It's 28¬∞ now. I'm in a tent, in a sleeping bag with a blanket... kinda hibernating until the temperature gets up to about 50¬∞.  I have a propane heater and a UCO candle lantern, but I'm just hibernating in the sleeping bag to save fuel. It'll be 50¬¥ in about 12 hours. Any day above freezing is a reason to party naked.
10tfzv0,,j79t3sp,Well I don't know if you're getting 15 mph, 40¬∞f winds with those 50¬∞ days. But when it's 50 here, sunny with *no wind* I can definitely take my jacket off and relax

10tcio9,j76mnum,,I feel ya OP and wish I could offer helpful advice. Last time I lived out of a car was 2003-2005.  Only good place to park where cops didn't eventually find me was in the woods, and an abandoned county park on a lake shore. It's risky, can be dangerous, but that's what I did. Drove around semi-rural areas looking for old abandoned roads, dirt roads leading into uninhabited wooded areas that seemed pretty quiet and safe. And I had relative privacy there. I could get of my car to change clothes or sponge bathe. Or take a piss etc.  Also to cook with propane camping stove. And drink the beer I kept in a cooler in my trunk. Only place you do that without getting busted is in the woods.  As for job apps, I listed my former address and nobody checked. Eventually I found a job through Dept. of Labor, and after working several months I finally confessed to my boss I was living out of my car. And I asked if he'd permit me to park on his company property. Thankfully he agreed. The property was fenced in with a locking gate, so I was fairly safe at night. But not entirely. Shit happened there too, lol, but that's a story for another time.  Anyway if you haven't already visited D.O.L.. give them a shot. Maybe list your former address, or a friend or family member's addy on the job app. And you wouldn't necessarily need a phone to be hired. You can return to their office daily, use their computer system and talk with staff.  I wish you the best OP. I know how hard this is for you emotionally. It's scary AF. Pretty humiliating and depressing too. And very lonely feeling like an outcast. But you can escape this shitty situation. Stay strong my friend.
10tcio9,j76c25r,,Best place to park is a 24 hour fitness parking lot. Especially if you‚Äôre paying to use their shower they do not give a single shit. I was there for 2 months with my sister until her blood flow issues forced us to get motels for our safety.  Long term survival tips: Get food stamps and hopefully cash aid. Go to food banks in addition to that. Get vitamin gummies and drink a fuck ton of water to stay healthy. Do delivery jobs to make extra money to survive. Sign up for DoorDash and UberEats. Donate plasma for extra money. Look up odd jobs on Craigslist for money. Craigslist also has rooms for rent. Transition to a sales job where there‚Äôs less to no cap on what you make (solar, insurance industry, etc.) if possible. Or whichever industry you can do some type of independent contracting to avoid a set wage limit. If you don‚Äôt have one already eventually get a storage unit for your important belongings If you need a laptop for work you can finance one through Best Buy. Mine‚Äôs 30 a month. Look up Volunteers Of America for the best resources near you. We were calling 211 almost everyday until we found stable resources through VOA. Good luck!
10tcio9,j762ghg,,I feel like the hardest part of all of this is really just coming to terms with your situation. Literally months ago I had no idea what was in store for me and now here am I struggling to keep my self above water. All my memories of a happier time were mere months ago.
10tcio9,,j762u2g,Same. I find myself day dreaming about fun conversations with my friends only to realise I'm alone in my car and that's not option for me right now. I mean it is but I don't want to put the burden of them knowing I'm struggling like this on them.
10tcio9,,j76kbnb,Two of the biggest mistakes I've learned that people make when confronted with homelessness are 1) being too embarrassed to ask for help and feeling like you're somehow a burden on others, and 2) choosing to be homeless because of ‚Ññ1 and thinking it'll be very much a temporary situation. There's a reason why all the old religions talk about pride being a bad thing.  If you have friends and/or family around, cast aside your pride, come clean, and ask for help. That's what friends and family are for, just don't abuse it.  Shit, even if it's just using their address on job applications and using the shower and WiFi every other day that's a huge advantage towards getting back on your feet. Let *them* decide how much help they're willing to give, and take it. Pay it back later. If they offer a couch or a room, take it, and put effort into cooking, cleaning, and making minor repairs if you know how which will show them appreciation and that you aren't trying to get a free ride.  Good luck out there.
10tcio9,,j76ukf4,Excellent advice.  Pride is the roadblock to getting help.
10tcio9,,j76gdqy,Best advice I can give u to get out of that situation is to try to find a local church that u feel comfortable going to, and go there every week get to know the people because u really need a support network. Don‚Äôt tell anyone initially that u live in your car. Church people are just more likely to want to help u get connected with possible place but the key is to gain trust of the decent pple in the community. Not immediately, u won‚Äôt be helped but once pple get to know u and see u are not a problem person who is choosing to live in car, but bc of circumstances.
10tcio9,,j7795po,I have a full house with someone on the couch but if my friend told me they were sleeping in the car I'd give them a month or two on my recliner to get a job and a place to stay.   I've let people take showers and I've fed a whole lot of people. I used to say, "bring me what you have and we will make dinner."  Sometimes we had interesting combinations but everyone always ate.  Hell my husband put in a shed in the back yard, insulated it, put in a sink and an air conditioner, ran an electrical line to it with two electrical outlets and that's another bedroom now. With the way things are we do what we have to do for family.   Life is hard right now. Everyone is hurting. It's going to get worse before it gets better. You don't know unless you ask.
10tcio9,,j76ua3a,Think about what you just said, friends. If they are indeed friends, they will be glad to help, if not, do you really want flakes. Think of ones that would be willing to help and call them.  They may say no, but if you don‚Äôt ask, you won‚Äôt know. All of them can be in your situation too; it‚Äôs not like they are immune. True friends- don‚Äôt see you as a burden.
10tcio9,,j76rj8n,Coming to terms for sure, but also the emotional toll as time drags on, wears ya down to the bone. Last time took me 2 full years to finally break free. There were days I almost lost hope. Days I seriously considered driving my car into a lake.
10tcio9,j774rd9,,> I often go without a good night's sleep because I'm always worried about being caught.  I called it the 3AM Knock.  I dreaded it.  That fear did, however, drive me to do two things.  First, it made me dig as deeply as I could into exactly where people \*are\* allowed to park overnight... and how I could exploit that.  Two... it eventually made me drive to where I am now.  If you are still worried about being discovered... start looking at the Park N Ride system in your state/county/area.  If the metro area where you are isn't that big, you may have to expand your range to find active Park N Ride lots.  In most states these facilities are the responsibility of the state Department of Transportation... which means that they are monitored/patrolled by the State Police, as opposed to the local cops in the cities/towns where the parking lots are actually located.  State Police have a slightly different... view... on minor crimes.  Usually.  At any rate, there are specific rules for that state's Parn N Ride system, and there are also rules that are specific to each parking lot, and they have to be posted AT that parking lot.  Let me put some concrete down here.  From September 2017 until September 2018, I lived in a Park N Ride lot, on the line between Lacey and Olympia, in Washington state.  The lot at Exit 109.  The rules of the lot were simple.  No vehicle could be left unattended for more than 48 hours.  The lot wasn't responsible for belongings left in vehicles, or vehicles left in the lot.  According to two of the State Troopers who would patrol the lot every Sunday, living in a vehicle legally constituted attending to a vehicle.  So I was actually living in my vehicle, in a lot where I had State Police \*Protection\*, if not tacit approval of the fact that I was living in that lot.  And I wasn't alone, either.  Others lived in their vehicles, in that lot.  Now, it was kind of a Perfect Storm, of sorts.  The Park N Ride lot I was in, and the others where people could live indefinitely, were all close to a highway.  The fact that the lots allowed overnight parking, was to provide travelers with a safe alternative to falling asleep at the wheel, on a highway system without rest stops.  This being Washington state, there are generally a lot of vacationers driving their RVs and Trailers up and down the western corridor between Oregon and Seattle.  So, there was already a system in place, and it had been for decades, to provide safe spots to pull off and sleep for the night before moving on.  Around Seattle, and the 5 cities basically touching Seattle, there is no sleeping in a vehicle of any kind allowed, except in specifically designated areas (this was until 2018).  Not the Walmart... all the Parn N Ride lots have specific restrictions against sleeping in a vehicle, etc.  Head south, and pre-2018, you could have slept in a PnR lot in Tacoma, 20 minutes away.  Now, with that [state Supreme Court ruling in 2018](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/judge-rules-seattle-homeless-mans-truck-is-a-home/), designating a Washington registered vehicle to be a person's home under the state's Homesteading Act, there are RVs, Trailers, Trucks, and cars parked all over the place in Olympia, Lacey, Aberdeen, etc. with people living in them, without fear of that 3AM knock.  So.  Start looking.  Some places won't have much, if any organized overnight parking.  You may have to shift your range 50-100 miles or so.  There are always loopholes somewhere though.  Where around you, are people expected to sleep off a long drive?  Where can truckers go when they have to stop driving?  I'm not saying that you should park between rigs... but, there may be a smaller vehicle lot nearby.  Is there a local Park N Ride system attached to the transit system in your area?  Bus transfer stops, train stations, etc.  Parking garages without specific restrictions against sleeping in vehicles can be nice and protected against the weather.  Find the highways, and find the rest stops.  Look for the PnR lots near highways.  Some beach parking lots absolve themselves of all legal responsibilities after a certain time.  Look for industrial areas that have third shifts.  You may be able to blend in with street parking in those areas, where your vehicle looks like just another worker's vehicle parked for their shift.  Remember.  Any place that allows for organized overnight parking like that... PnR lots, Airports, Bus Stations, Train Stations, etc... they not only have rules for their lots, but they HAVE to post them as per federal and state guidelines.  So if the sign at the lot does NOT specifically restrict you from sleeping in a vehicle... you can sleep in the vehicle.  If the sign ONLY says "No Overnight Parking"... you cannot get in trouble for sleeping in the vehicle during the day.

10tcio9,j76j6jk,,A car makes it easier to roam a bit.  Find 8-10 good places to park and change each night. One night in a truck-stop (good for showers) Walmart, move on to hospital near ER, then your gym (showers again), a couple other places, and start over.  By making a loop you do not cover much ground saving on gas, you have a locked vehicle for added safety and staying dry, you can have a bit more stuff with you, and you are not in one place long enough to stand out. If you do get hassled move to your next spot.

10t7dbd,j75sn3k,,Generally my first step is to get clients on Medicaid.  Apply at the local DHS office, at least in my state homeless applicants are fast tracked and get benefits almost immediately (also for food stamps).  Medicaid covers a lot of meds and types of visits/doctors, at least in the cases I‚Äôve seen.  There are usually low-cost providers in most major cities that could be resources.

10t7dbd,j7bvinv,,Community mental health.   Large cities often have mental health facilities specifically for people on Medicare/medicaid. They will have social workers who can help apply for disability or medical and they will have psychiatrists and psychologists on staff.   Some places are better than others, ymmv.

Also, some of the older hikers might ask you if you can carry thier pack for awhile and maybe give you a 20.00.

There will always be tough times ahead no matter our situation; but it is temporary. Trust and believe in whatever god's are out there that this will pass. I've been there. I was stabbed, almost lost an arm, was almost paralyzed from a car accident, wife passed away, so much more, and I'm now in a much better place in life where I'm ok enough to breathe a little sigh of relief.. I don't say this in any way to invalidate your struggle, I say it because I have been there where I, too, wish I had the courage to end it all. I'm so glad I didn't. Look forward to better things. Have hope. And always keep fighting.

10sy4nm,j75gr05,,While you're looking for work, you might benefit from finding some volunteer work to do. It won't help your money problems, but feeling productive can help your depression from overwhelming you. It will also put you in contact with more people, which might help you find a job.  I'm mentally ill, too. My depression and anxiety can make something as simple as making a phone call extremely difficult. So finding a way out of my situation usually seems impossible. I've isolated myself from friends and family, in part because of shame, but mostly because I don't want to make anyone feel like they have to take me in.  What country are you in? Maybe there are resources available that you haven't thought of.

Behind that, there's a sense of reckless abandon and apathy folks get from rough living that tends to shy predators away.  A seasoned manipulator (or coven of vampires) can smell that shit from decades away and will avoid you in lieu of a more convenient victim.   If you are ready and willing to fight and loose limbs for what you believe in, and you're absolutely bat-shit crazy, and you hate everything and everyone and you just want to die, people tend to leave you alone.

10snukj,,j7j1zll,Haha yeah, fun conversation.  Like for example, a friend of mine was getting mugged in St. Louis.  As they approached him, he just started laughing maniacally, starting rolling around on the ground, twisting and contorting his body, frothing at the mouth.  His would-be muggers said "Oh, shit! fuck this", and... gave him some space.  Or another friend who noticed she was being followed (on foot) late at night by some guy who likely had some bad intentions.... so, she starts talking to herself (and getting into a heated argument... with herself), pretending to be schizophrenic or having multiple personalities, and her would-be assailant suddenly changed course.

I also sleep next to a large stake I sharpened into a spear. Keeping a distance from people is optimal. I live near so many junkies and meth heads. Some try to take an aggressive tone.

10snukj,j74lpbc,,Honestly? Cigarettes. I know it sounds crazy, but in my experience most people would rather smoke a cigarette than get in a fight. So if someone is getting crazy around me, I just ask if they‚Äôd like a cigarette.   Additionally I stay out of the bullshit and drama. I have a reputation for being fair and helpful and generally get along with everyone. I lived around a lot of different types of people and honestly never had any issues.
10snukj,,j75fhy0,I do the same. Just this afternoon, I was at the Dunkin Donuts by the bus station and managed to diffuse a potentially violent confrontation. The folks who work there let us chill as long as we behave, so it's a hangout for the indigent.   There's a local character who probably has some kind of psychosis; the first time I saw him, I thought he was arguing with someone on the phone using a Bluetooth earpiece, but he wasn't wearing one. He can be a little unsettling, but he's harmless. Most people know who he is and let him be.   A meth head thought he was yelling at her. She was ready to throw down. I stepped in, gave her a pair of disposable hand warmers, showed her my cigarettes and asked her to come outside and smoke with me. I had to talk to her for a few minutes, which was uncomfortable, but it kept her from blowing up our spot.
10snukj,j737tcf,,Many answers will land you in jail.                      If you drink alcohol do not get a gun. Under the influence with a gun is a bad charge. So is an illegal gun. If your completely sober then a gun is an option. Long gun may be easier but very hard to carry and/or hide.
10snukj,,j74q4ne,If I had a gun when I was drinking, I wouldn't be here today typing this entry in reddit.
10snukj,,j75dczc,I hear you. I've made the decision to end my life and come up with a plan at least half a dozen times. What saved me was the time it took to actually follow through. By the time I got to the location I'd chosen and/or got together the necessary accoutrements, the drive to follow through had faded.   I'm not against people owning guns, but I know that if I get one, it's only a matter of time before I use it on myself.
10snukj,,j74fzfl,I prefer to think of it as the homeless shelter. Or I sometimes laughingly refer to County as the safety net. Oh and an arrest is actually a rescue. Then again I'm sardonic as they come.
10snukj,j737esz,,Bear spray and a club not a knife unless your trained in knife fighting your both likely to get stabbed and someone end up in prison for murder.  I used to have a hard and heavy wood cane and weighted the end with some lead. Its perfect because a cane is a medical device so you can take it anywhere and can't be denied. Its heavy and can work as a club or a hook to grab and twist, pull, or trip. As A mobility aid people will not be absolutely sure your disabled depending on age but it will put the thought in people minds. In my state assaulting an elderly OR disabled person gets a minimum mandatory 5 years and they don't mess around. A guy in my home town without a record of violence or robbery pushed a guy with a cane and stole his money and bottle of liquor. The theft charges were dropped for just a plea on the assault but because of the disability was a mandatory 5 years. He spent all 5 years locked up and then like 3 more on parole I think.  Some people see a cane as a weak person and easy target, most know better. My advice is tell your Dr you have Bali ance issues and get it documented and a cheap cane through them, then your covered even more.
10snukj,,j74qshe,For a while, I thought about getting one of those canes whose handle pulled out into a knife. Didn't Patrick McNee in The Avengers have something like that? Maybe James Bond?
10snukj,,j785gjv,That would be a bad charge in many places. And you will forever be stopped and harassed when using a cane after that and if you medically needed it that would be a nightmare going forward.
10snukj,j739w6c,,I have a machete, a hatchet, a longer knife, and several pocket knives ‚Äî however, I don't really use any of these as a form of defense. Rather, I usually keep them stuffed away in my cart where they aren't easily accessible so that people, particularly cops, don't get alarmed that I have them.  Instead, for defense, I primarily rely on a trekking pole. It's not the best weapon, but it has reach, and it can pack a punch if you poke somebody with it. I also have my dog, who serves as an alarm and a form of intimidation, both of which deter most people who want to start shit.
10snukj,,j74r16t,You're right. Prolly the best deterrent is a pitbull. I know it would DEFINITELY keep me the fuck away.

10snukj,j74h174,,Go to Home Depot and get a broom stick. This is now your walking stick and staff. Get one made out of hardwood. It can be used to get distance between you and an attacker, and can be used to strike someone. It‚Äôs better then a knife because it allows you to keep your distance.
10snukj,j74q0ib,,Know your area.  If you‚Äôve set up camp, perhaps select and locate objects for intended purposes:  Example for tent set up‚Ä¶tent door is twelve ‚ÄòO clock position.

10snukj,,j7877qx,Good way to get killed, especially if you get it on someone else nearby.  I don't know if you have any diseases but to protect myself will assume you do. Things will bet ugly.                        Now me personally, I wouldn't give someone reason to fight me or throw piss at me but god help you if you throw it at someone else and it gets on me.  Outside of direct violence/robbery this may be the only guaranteed way to provoke me to violence. And whomever threw piss on me would be very miserable until they relocated and if I got hurt defending myself from the loss thrower I would absolutely file a report, and while I wouldn't press charges I would get a restraining order forcing them to relocate.                       Think about your actions and who else they may effect. A "weapon" that can indiscriminately harm others (innocents)  besides the person threatening you is a bigger danger to you than just the person your facing.  Make sure you only hit your target.                        I did once casually unzip my pants and start pissing on a guy in my face yelling at me. Mid-hollering he stops and gets a funny look on his face and then looks down to see my pants unzipped and I'm pissing on his legs. As he pushed me away I then got one good hit in before he beat the shit out of me. I scored my points and he never fucked with me again. I had offered him a sip off my pint because I knew he was getting either sick and he chugged the whole thing. I had one sip only and was facing withdrawal myself now. I knew I was most likely going to lose this fight so I did what I had to. Many times you can "out crazy" someone but occasionally they really are fucked up and BAD people and that blows up in your face.

I distracted him with $80 from my shirt pocket and got out of the taxi and ran.    Why did he not stab me like he stabbed 6 other taxi drivers?

10snduz,,j73e182,I was paid up on every month by no later than the given deadline no matter what matter of payment I made. It wasn't until I missed January that my balance was the month+ whatever else. I made that payment, and a portion of February, and as of 02/01, the rent for February was paid entirely.   I no longer am behind on anything to my knowledge.
10snduz,,j73lg6w,Furthermore, in all the months I was paying as I was, I never had to pay a late fee or any other applicable fees, so I really wasn't behind on my payments. Nothing of what I was sent relayed any sentiment of eviction or the process thereof.   But to the best of my knowledge, as long as I paid what I needed to before 02/20, then whatever this is, is supposed to stop
10snduz,j72kscr,,No one on here can tell. You need to talk to your leasing office and show them the receipt you paid
10snduz,j74693o,,The purpose for this conference may be because your landlord may want to discuss the matter of how you have been paying your monthly rent.  I know you are paid up to date now, but the landlord might not be okay with how you were paying it and they might want to have this meeting to talk with you about this..
10snduz,,j77fhi9,Yeah, they tend to want a payment first of month and not have to take payments. If you have been allowed to make payments, damn you lucky. I have rented with the agreement if all cash is not in hand by 5pm on the 5th, begin packing
10snduz,,j77hcj2,Exactly üíØ... and I have personally never known a landlord that didn't charge late fees.  From my experience, it's due by the 5th and payable no later than 5:00pm..if not paid then late fees will be added.  So if he has gotten by all those months without paying the late fees, this very well could be the reason for this conference.
10snduz,j74jfpv,,DO you have 100% proof you have paid? There could be late fee's and legal fee's they are trying to collect. You must speak face to face with manager / owner of property.

Someone here tries to be kind and helpful and selfless, .... let's try to reciprocate.  Anyway... OP, you got the right intentions.  Folks living on the street can react in a lot of adverse ways when you put things in a religious connotation.  Also, #4 on your list "adversities" might rub some people the wrong way... so...

Also, you can provide honey and things that keep well to mix with the peanut butter and add caloric value. Look into what backpackers take on trips on the Appalachian trail for some good ideas.

10s7jf0,,j72cg04,ditch the tent & get a military surplus bivy sack + tarp A-frame over you. Paracord tied between 2 trees, tarp draped over it with the corners staked in the ground forming an A-frame shelter.   Technically the military bivy will work just fine by itself in moderate rainfall, you just can't fit your pack inside. But it will keep you and your sleeping bag bone dry inside of it in a torrential downpour overnight
10s7jf0,j71584h,,I personally went for a camping hammock, overtarp and underquilt/top quilt combo. Onetigris type brand which is affordable. Or Chinese hiking brands that do down gear but not super expensive. A camping pillow is a good idea. The tarp can be fix in different ways to protect against rain and I used tieoffs to run the water down instead of in, even used some silicon grease I found at work to make sure the water flowed where I wanted it to.   I slept on a roundabout that is a wooded area island surrounded by roads. I had a spot I chose to cross the road when I could safely see that no cars were coming. This was a couple of miles outside of town center. I used earplugs to help me sleep because of the cars at night but I was relatively safe with all the trees around me.   I used a shovel to dig a bathroom hole. Wetwipes were essential for wiping my face hands and body down, and I took my trash/waste to work with me every morning.   I used a bicycle to travel and kept tubes and puncture repear kits on hand as well as a pump. I made sure I had a couple of refill water bottles always. I used a powerbank for my phone charging and made sure both were charged before leaving work.   I kept a wet bag type thing for surfing... Used that to store my clean clothes and another one for dirty clothes. Mostly underwear because I wore my work uniform daily. I used a launderette/laundromat weekly to wash my clothes and sometimes went to the gym to shower when necessary. I wore thermal under garments made of wool which I bought discount at go outdoors shop. Which helped keep me warm.  I ate nuts, sandwiches and things I could buy fresh from the store. I brushed my teeth every day keeping everything in a backpack.  I left my hammock set up every day where it was as I wasn't worried about it being found. But I did also leave a note inside explaining I was homeless and please don't destroy my stuff.  I did this for five months and had a kick ass beard at the end. I learned a lot about knots, myself, reliance and also a bit about the ignorance of others. Nobody knew what I was going through and I managed to keep the entire thing secret.  I called it "tactical homelessness", I read books about stoicism and managed to get out of debt, eventually it became a game... How much money could I save. How minimalist could I be. I felt invincible.

10s7jf0,j764vkh,,I decided that being able to have a hot meal (that wasn't prepared in a dirty microwave at a gas station) was necessary to stave off despair. I made canned soup a staple in my diet. It's cheap and nutritious, and it's easy to prepare.   I bought a cheap mess kit with a cooking pot big enough to hold a can of soup. I made an [alcohol stove](https://youtu.be/Mg91VsButWE) and bought some 91% isopropyl alcohol (a.k.a. rubbing alcohol) to fuel it. I used cotton gauze (which I was able to get for free) instead of fiberglass inside the stove, and it worked well enough, although I have to replace it periodically.   I used an empty Progresso can (they're wider than typical soup cans) to make a wind shield for the stove. It also holds the pot over the stove while cooking. I removed the bottom and used the awl on my Swiss army knife to make a bunch of holes in the sides of the can spaced about two centimeters apart, widening them with the fish scaler (first time I ever used the fish scaler) until they were about as big around as a pencil. I kept another empty Progresso can (this one unmodified) for snuffing out the stove.

Waterlogged trees snapped like match sticks and crashed down all around. Luckily none fell on my car, but a 2 foot thick oak did fall and block the only trail out of that wood patch. I couldn't get back to the road.  Fortunately I was working for a pallet maker not far away. In the morning I grabbed a handsaw from the company shop and cut my way out. Probably should have asked for a chainsaw though. Phew! that was one hella workout.  Got plenty more stories like that on tap, but I'd need to write a novel.  North Georgia weather, Jeez Louise.

Put on a scarf because it was still pretty cold. Then walked to a shelter that had an old fire place.  Gathered a few sticks and made a fire. Used it to thaw my water bottles.

10s2twt,j707vl7,,I've not stayed at a shelter, but from what I hear, both the shelters and (something I do have experience with) any kind of drug treatment program, they tend to treat people like they're children, and are quick to punish you for the slightest mistake.   I too understand the need for curfew and doing things correctly but we're all human and mistakes happen, it's trying enough being in this situation without having everyone from shelter employees to bus drivers to clerks at the store constantly treating you like something they'd find on the bottom of their shoe.  It's fucked up, sad thing is, I know homeless people other than us, and I know how a lot of them are, so I kinda understand the zero tolerance stuff, but damnit it sucks when you're not the problem but get treated like you are!
10s2twt,j70rn0p,,I just sent a fake media request for information.  We'll see if they get back.

10s2twt,j6z4fqi,,Unthinkable
10s2twt,j72cj6p,,I so hope things improve you for you. im sorry you are seeing and going thru this. you were mistreated because the shelters in some places for night, open at 4pm and lock at night by 9pm 10pm, some places its 11pm to 6am locked doors. im not sure who youd want to complain to. there is the injustice league but they alreayd received these sorts of outcome complaints about treatment there. the rules are never clear and often mis-enforced.   hey op, sufficient classic9217 did they tell you youd lose your space or bed if you left? here, pple can leave to get dinner nearby or buy snacks nearby, return and still have their place or bed. often over capacity too.  also OKC area mental health wards are "trying to help" but really its a holding pattern. cycle this group of homeless/at risk adults in, then cycle them out after a few weeks of food and a bed. some have found their stays annoying because its young pple as staff (new at work its not their fault, they see a nail, they grab a hammer) trying out their degrees in giving labels to homelesss pple. at this point, whats a label matter? for example, these poor kids told a 60 year old wife and granmother paranoid schizo. she said to them then relayed it to me later. I loved this, it was something Id say too, "Ive raised 5 boys and had one prick husband for 45+years. you are children here at work, now whens lunch?" and walked away from her own care plan meeting. she didnt even reply about the label. she went on to say her own spouse had called her plenty of names more name didnt matter to her at 60. yep. after a while all that matters is existing in life and hopefuly housed.     I went to several wards for exhaustion, clothes, meals, a bed and sure I am going to rest, recoup and chill. for that its antisocial behavior. lololol. hilarious. I am running a contest elsewhere to mock how many labels a homeless person can net like this. its hilarious. beacuse if we are being labeled with more illnesses and more meds are thrown at us, then pay us for all these "labels and disagnoses, clusters of shit, ok cool, whens dinner?" LOLOLO. meds get stolen or its complicated to have a care plan of any kind like self care if you become homeless. there's way to become organized, sure. its just a bathroom, kitchen usually have a medicine cabinet but when there is a backpack, a bike or truck, a laundry bag, a bag where the food (minus refrigeration lemme add) is kept.   one time last year my friend wanted me out of their parents house. which i expected but didnt think they lie to old pple about me but good for them. i dont care. too old to care. but still here to do data. lol. I was there for a few days because I got injured moving as I was evicted and went to the ER from pain and dehydration/wound needed help - temporary help, temporary stay. as in a week or less. it was like 11 days, was there too long. so I bought a few dollars of cold food I missed a great deal and they didnt like me buying 3 cold items, milk, OJ and yogurt. the "MF fren" made up a story to parents and they told me to leave, kept my food. talk about nutrition and they are church going prisses unaware that god loves/hates his creation. hes not a nice god none of these faiths are ever nice or kind just hate, rejection, head games over glory and power. well the white power trips Ive encountered are enough for me. its better to stay in the cold, layered that have more encounters like that.
10s2twt,j7294gl,,thats common. she was probably thrown out to make an example to others to get in line regardless of disability or be kicked out. the punishment culture/prison system thinking exists in so many places today. exists in many industries and settings, lotta children with power trips to enforce. I wouldnt expect good treatment in a shelter. shelters in OKC, Norman OK are regular fight zones and little else. scarcity, lack, dirty. the pple who manage it are teh kind of pple that dont make you feel safe to fall asleep at night.   'todays funny' about meds is that meds are given but who can take them while homeless? whats the point, at times a person has to go hyper aware of day to day events. whatever problems once existed fade away, homelessness changes a person often for the worse.   yes perhaps Christian Taliban or the rule autists act up. if one jot or tittle is left undone you are written up, scolded, shamed, then placed into a holding pattern of for example, landlord writing negative rental reviews 7 months after eviction. or the way rules are enforced sans discretion. and I mean no discretion. one time the place that evicted me was in the process of evicting two other pple and moved on to writing me up for dumb shit like walking outside at one a.m. to my car. another lady was written up for sitting outside her apartment balcony with her bra strap exposed slightly on a long house dress. she showed me the exact dress and said both mgers have the cameras on their phones to monitor the poroperty. I asked, for what, we pay rent here, whats to watch? who are these pple? I thought yep im next. i was written up for comings, gonigs then evicted. shelters gave me a hard time over minor stuff as well. Fixed rules without discretion or flexibility is regrettable. To copeüòÇ I call it all artistic irritation no matter how egregious and obnoxious or "how can this happen" the said event was. accept it. forget them, then make a plan or next step for somewhere to be. the lady in the wheelchair has the option to a ER trip to tell them about the shelter. ER docs might have a bed for her. ER docs have told me that they often keep the homeless for  afew days because of their malnourishment, dehydration and lack of shower/food. then case mgmt is called and case mgmt tries to help. hopefully she went to the ER afterwards because the ER docs would also send her back or to another place with the words or attitude of fight with them. Which if homeless a person isn't wanting or looking for a fight. The poor wheelchair lady need a bed there, they have to re-admit or accept you back. ER is a ER not a shelter. But places try hard to help even if they give you food.  I call the extreme rule keeping short temperedness and hatred. not rule issuers or pple trying to operate in a role of a shelter staff volunteer or worker. Or just petty. It's how pressured pple are at work to enforce all these rules, they fear losing their job no matter how sad or depressing the job is.   and if you did complain you will receive less help or be remembered as a trouble maker not a person that experienced unfairness. Pple don't care you encounter unfairness there's no real recourse just acceptance, then move past the event and let it go.   If you go towards housing applications and towards renting you WILL FIND HOUSING.   Keep the hope, ignore the bad times, yes they hurt to experience and witness.

10s0ctg,,j796ofk,If nothing else, our resiliency is certainly being sharpened.  Countless people across the world are being forced out of comfort, out of high living standards, and out of their homes and apartments due to the engineered economic inflation and unnatural cost of living.  Sadly, more and more are joining the ranks of we, the unhoused.  In a sense, we are ahead of that curve.  And there are always others out there suffering more than we are.  Not that this downplays our own tribulations, but I find it healthy to keep sight of this perspective.  I understand all too well your doubts about not being able to function in 'normal people land.'  I assure you, you will be able to, if and when you arrive at a better station in life.  You're capable of more than you know.  Think about what you value, and what you need to be truly content and enjoy life.  For me (32m), I've been a minimalist my entire adult life, and this chapter has definitely hardened that mentality a bit more.  I enjoy gardening, growing my own food & cannabis, the change of the seasons, watching animals, cooking healthy meals, and having a small set of high quality clothing and basic living gear.  Being a voice of encouragement and hope for others has always been the greatest part of my (past) world travels.  One benefit to our dire situation is that it really cuts away distractions, and things that we don't need.  "Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things" - Shawshank Redemption  "And now these three remain - faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love" - 1 Corinthians 13:13  "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning" - Psalm 30:5  Some of us just have to endure longer nights than others  üíö
10s0ctg,,j798hc2,thank you a lot for this, it really touched me and i am doing very bad mentally. it came exactly the time it was needed, as silly as that sounds.   i do feel "ahead of that curve" in that way. i often think "well, now i know what to do if x happens". and ive definitely hardened in many ways, but also been mentally a trainwreck in other ways. i am 22f.   i was actually right now contemplating the good things in my life that i am grateful for: 1) i am not a junkie anymore. been clean af. using pot medicinally to deal with PTSD nightmares though, but i havent had drugs in over 2 years and not a drop of alcohol since july. i am proud of having gotten here, especially during being homeless. survived an oxy+xan overdose in 2020.   2) my best friend and his literally life saving support. he is busy right now but he knows exactly who he is and how i feel about it.   3) finally no longer experiencing domestic violence and extremely weird batshit cult(y) shit all the time. even at the expense of homelessness, i would make that choice over and over.   4) disability benefits making me able to not starve and little by little having "geared up" because of it.   5) despite it being hellish, i have had some quite beautiful and deeply touching experiences that i otherwise wouldnt have.    i know there are people that have it worse, and that does keep me in check, but also makes me really depressed for these people and i feel almost hopeless sometimes because i cant help them. but i still try to do good when i can because the world needs fewer jerks. we have probably seen some shit that others cannot even dream about. i still wish i wasnt forced to "toughen up" and could have a normal life for a girl my age instead, but ive been.... waaaaay off that wagon for many many many years. still i am here though and have to survive somehow.   i am very not religious because of trauma, but being very familiar with the New Testament (studied it in greek + latin), 1 Corithians 13 is an absolutely beautiful passage that speaks to me. truly beautiful words.   thank you for the random act of niceness and excuse my ramblings

I'm glad to read about these positive changes in your life, and the things you have survived.  I consider cannabis to be a healing herb, and definitely not a drug in the sense that most people mean.  It sounds like you're well onto the path of improvement.  We're being refined through the fire of this world, and growing as individuals despite the way it feels like we're merely existing.  Your best friend sounds like an absolute blessing.  I reached out to my youngest childhood friend, but he wasn't able to offer me a spot, mostly because of his uptight wife.  It is what it is.  At the risk of sounding patronizing, 22 is still so young, and most people at that age in modern nations barely have a clue who they really are, what they need or even want.  You're going through an education that no college can offer.  And yes, I had to stop attending church in my teens and delve into Scripture for myself before I ever woke up spiritually.  Song of Songs is a favorite, the most beautiful love poem ever written, in my view.  Ecclesiastes is fascinating, and the Psalms are so raw and honest.  Proverbs for wisdom and grounding.  Anyway, stay warm, love.  We never know what the future may bring  üíö
10s0ctg,,j79c5vu,that line about song of songs i couldve written myself. it is my favourite thing in the entire canon. thanks for the niceness again. good luck and i wish you the best.   1 Corinthians 16:13 " be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous, be strong.

10s0ctg,j704bz3,,I‚Äôve been out of stable housing for over a year, so I feel you. I‚Äôm lucky as fuck to have a car, but the thought of being able to have somewhere safe I can sleep alone at night without having to worry about people knocking on the windows or having to wake up and move at a certain time sounds wonderful

10ryovh,j6yni62,,If you're in a neighborhood where you're cool with the Bodega people, you can use their shit. Like order and buy a cold sandwich, have them make it hot after
10ryovh,j6yjnd7,,If you have a college near you (including community colleges), there's usually microwaves and toaster ovens stashed around various lounge and study areas and definitely in the dining halls.  There's also plenty of outlets, comfy places to sit, open wifi, and even showers. When I was living on the street instead of in my car, I would only stay in towns that had a community college. If you stake it out, you can also often find a spot to sleep inside overnight.
10ryovh,,j6z93az,Community colleges, huh? I'll remember that when I'm back out on the street.
10ryovh,,j70uwwn,Yeah if you're in Seattle, UW campus is a good place to chill and eat and you most likely won't be bothered
10ryovh,,j7102uy,And no security cards to deal with? Seriously?   I may go back to Seattle!
10ryovh,,j710jrh,I'm not a student and I've gotten food at the court and have chilled at the library/random buildings on campus. Not sure if the computers are usable by the public though
10ryovh,,j7120v8,Check the institution's library website for information about a visitor pass
10ryovh,,j715oa1,I like how your comment sounds like an automated message from UW üò≠ lol but yes do this!!
10ryovh,,j72dbja,Lol Ty I was sleepy, so extra laconic!
10ryovh,,j74hg78,Did you mean cards or guards btw
10ryovh,,j7adx9k,Lol. I mean cards. And IDs. And all that stuff.
10ryovh,,j701tow,Which ones specifically? The community college I went to didn‚Äôt have showers.
10ryovh,,j72z2j1,Most of them I'm familiar with have a locker room and showers as part of their athletics/phys ed/kinesiology/whatever program. Some smaller ones (and especially satellite campuses) probably don't, but larger established community colleges do.
10ryovh,,j729kyx,Yes! I've been in college for 2 years now and I'm still finding new lounges and reading nooks I didn't know about. The student union building has basically a full kitchen for students to use
10ryovh,j6ygkvo,,Agreed!  The only one that I've come across with a public microwave is Whole Foods.
10ryovh,,j6yikf1,I think some 7-11s have them.
10ryovh,j6ym6vy,,If you're in Texas, HEB and Central Market stores have them.
10ryovh,j702pks,,Truck stops. Only problem is they're not really in urban areas
10ryovh,j7109ml,,Sometimes Sprouts stores have them.  I like simple organic beans. Or the pinto chili mix. For like a $1 or $1.29 you have a good healthy protein source. Full for hours. Gets all the old stuff out of you too lol  For cheap staples like this, Whole Foods 365 brand is the same price usually, and someone else wrote they have microwaves, too!  Fancy people stores can be cheaper than stores that exploit poor people, I‚Äôll tell you that. Depends on what you get, though.
10ryovh,j6z8wpy,,Convenience stores and hotel lobbies

10ryovh,j72i9je,,I've seen these in grocery stores. Also, Amazon stores in NYC have them at the front of the store and because they don't really have staff to bother you if you walk in and do your own thing.
10ryovh,j731k1r,,There‚Äôs oftentimes ones in the grocery store and some gas stations. In the grocery store, it‚Äôs near the pre-made food section, close to the back wall. They‚Äôre usually within the counter itself, so, low to the ground. Hard to see. I tend to ask the employee behind the counter. If it‚Äôs a gas station it‚Äôs the same idea, typically low to the ground. Only gas stations that are nice and have pizza, hot dogs, fruit, etc will have a microwave. Definitely upped my spirits during the cold Colorado winter.   Another tip: Believe it or not, food stamps cover some premade foods if they aren‚Äôt hot. I don‚Äôt know how, but try it on the cold salmon or chicken. Then microwave it, ta-da.
10ryovh,j74auh6,,Maybe try a gas station that sells hot dogs, might have to buy something cheap or ask nicely?
10ryovh,j75qgp3,,7/11 for sure has public microwaves. I work at one now, after around 8 months of being homeless. Not sure about the other locations, might depend on whether it's corporate or franchise, but ours is busy enough that we don't really notice or care if someone pops in to use it, even if you didn't buy something from the store. It's sitting out in the open.   There's also a table in the back you can sit at and eat, or wait for the bus/get warm. Some of my douchier coworkers don't like the loitering, but I always let people stay and warm up, wait for their rides/bus/charge their phones or whatever. We also have pizzas you can buy with EBT, but can cook in the store for you if you ask. Hope that helps
10ryovh,j708pz8,,My meemaw has an extra microwave, if anyone needs one. She's moving in with her bff, Maybelle "Sugarfoot" Tishmallow, who already has a deluxe microwave oven.

10rs9pa,,j77dqhh,I thought I read somewhere that can be worse because of the condensation it‚Äôs better to get something like a balaclava and have your face exposed because the moisture can freeze. I‚Äôve never slept outside in that weather so I can‚Äôt say. But I‚Äôm glad you were able to stay warm and it worked for you.

10rs9pa,j72nskx,,Find the nearest Fire Department.  Seriously.  Fire Departments hold toy drives for kids at XMas, and clothing/coat drives when local churches don't.  Most Fire Departments have an ambulance inside as well.  The Department itself will have a stock of emergency Red Cross-type blankets that they carry on the trucks, for people who are wet and cold at accident or fire scenes.  Big goats come with the job itself, and if it is cold enough, you could end up with an old fireman's coat to keep you warm.  Or maybe you'll get to pick through a few left-over coats from their last drive.  And... the ambulance will not only have extra blankets, but likely thermal blankets and instant hot packs as well.  You could be invited in for heat and coffee... and end up with some probationary fireman being sent to the store to buy you a sleeping bag and coat.

10rnrs1,j70jv6o,,Yeah, I've just spent about 3 months watching homeless documentaries (but no movies). I have watched many of them probably a dozen times and they are still both very sad/tragic but also interesting. I usually just bring up YT and type in "homeless documentary" and end up with a whole list of them.  One I enjoyed the most was about a lady who moved out to SD with her two kids while her husband worked in Kentucky. Another one was a PBS documentary. There are quite a few of them out there.
10rnrs1,j70s9tj,,There is a film called Rosie about an Irish family with children who become homeless. It is very realistic and shows how easily it can happen.

10rn5ee,j6wm5qd,,about $120 a day doing yardwork in the colorado area in the summer--and in the colder months hit up a couple of temp agencies in downtown denver usually just sweeping construction sites - i am able to save up a good chunk doing this--showering at the rec center and camping outside but it is a rough life. Due to mental health illness and addiction I cannot have roommates and to rent a single apartment in my area is about $1500 a month--just can't conceive of spending $1500 a month on housing so....I just keep on living outside cuz i like it here. I could move to texas and get a place but I like colorado and it's the sacrifice I make. I'm too ugly to find a girlfriend to split rent with also--that can be an option for many in my boat around here.
10rn5ee,,j6wppzo,mental health issues aside, you sound a lot more grounded and sane than most folks I've ever met.    I used to do the same kind of work for years, for the same kind of pay in Texas:  Landscaping, tree trimming, light construction and re-modeling work.  Yeah about $120 for a full day.  I love that kind of work, it's good exercise and sometimes it's really rewarding to see the end result of the labor.  If I was back in The States, I'd probably be doing a lot the same as you.  Fuck paying rent, I'd rather live for free at my own campsite by a river or lake.   &#x200B;  >I'm too ugly to find a girlfriend to split rent with also  I'll bet the ladies in my neighborhood would find you to be charming,.... and that rugged sense of independence you have would certainly go a long way.  For reference (as I mentioned in another post) I look and smell like a caveman and somehow still stumble into romantic predicaments all too often!  I hope that's a bit encouraging.

Like you say, you'll end up tripping over it walking down the sidewalk.  In 'the state of Jefferson' the locals would sometimes kick us down like a half a pound of weed when we were spanging and jamming outside their favorite organic natural food store.  Fucking heros!  We weren't even looking for any weed.  It just happens to be everywhere.  Like, literally oozing out of the fucking dumpsters if you catch the right time.

The banks and big corporations have been quietly setting up a monopoly on the housing market for the past 20 fucking years.   ... and now these days you gotta submit to a rectal exam and pay a $200 fee just to look at a fucking box that they might let you rent if you let them take half your paycheck.

10rn5ee,,j7cgxhx,Banks and corporations do not have "a monopoly on the housing market."
10rn5ee,,j7e7bxc,While it may not TECHNICALLY be a monopoly yet, that's the goal, and they're mostly responsible for all of the housing market problems.

10rn5ee,,j7j8o7q,lol, are you? Do you have any understanding of the workings of finance and home building over the last ten to twenty years? Do you have any idea what companies Blackrock and Vanguard don't play in the home building market? Or what role they didn't play in the financial crisis of 08 and how that led here?  Have you watched a bunch of videos on reddit and youtube claiming those companies are the devil without citing anything relevant?   The truth is long, complex and boring. There are many parties that played a part, some got rich, others went bust, and none were/are the architects. You want someone to blame? You can pin it on anyone and let dozens of others go free. You want to fix it? Vote for better politicians who actually know their policy(which you never will because that's people in the finance industry who know how to fix it, not loud mouthed tweet stars who tell you what you want to hear).
10rn5ee,,j7jb5af,Are you under the impression that the massive problems in modern western civilization are just circumstantial, or the result of mismanagement, or can be pinned on its everyday citizens?  You can't see that everything that is happening right now in your culture is ABSOLUTELY by design because you were indoctrinated from a young age to have faith in a system which uses you up and throws you out like an old piece of fruit.  The entire financial situation the west is in is NO ACCIDENT.  The entire cultural disease of widespread division in these countries was carefully crafted, and most of you folks fell for it.  There's no fixing anything at this point.  I'm just gonna sit here on the other side of the world and watch your entire way of life burn to the ground and say "Amen"

But since you decided you know me and shoot me a bunch of insults, I'll just add that I have a really great community of family and friends, a beautiful house in the countryside, and a career I do hate but that has offered me an early retirement I plan on using watching birds and camping(specifically those because I also hate our society, I just try to deal with it functionally as apposed to being an insane terminally online troll).  but thanks for finally exposing **your blanket hatred of other people**, thin skin and idiocy in plain sight.

Also, how intimidating is your average homeless? Can they bully a fly spot, one of the 3 good ones in the area? Are they 50 percent heavyweight, 50 percent lightweight?  The average experience is hypothetical. The person doesn't exist. Keep on speculating or defending or bad mouthing a non-entity. Go for it. Waist your time.

10rinoh,,j6w9etn,Yeah it feels like you have to pay just to get slavery.
10rinoh,,j6x381m,It's not slavery. You're not forced to do it. Workaway is a volunteer program. It's for people who can and want to help small businesses and nonprofits. It wasn't designed to be an employment program.
10rinoh,,j6x4ow0,Let's be honest, I've did 2 of them and one was straight up slavery. YMMV but it was awful.
10rib4u,j6w9ig8,,Why would the free market build anything but market rate housing if they were not forced to build affordable housing? Capital doesn't do things out of the goodness of it's heart.  San Francisco already has 8 bunk beds and a toilet apartments and they are still barely affordable. It's like a homeless shelter full of 20 year old computer programmers, so... worse smell.  Charities build Tuff Shed communities and give you 40 $7,000 buildings that somehow cost 2 million dollars in a town with 5000 homeless people. That's what capitalism does for homelessness when the government outsources the jobs it should be doing.
10rib4u,,j6wtcho,In places with lax laws around building or where the government looks the other way, very poor people are able to have housing. For example the Philippines where families will build bamboo shacks underneath Bridges, Mexico where families will build corrugated metal shacks on the outskirts of industrial towns. Haiti and South Africa where people who struggle to afford rice nonetheless have an enclosed cob walled space to call home.  In general if not destroyed by authorities through violence, most people are capable of constructing a dwelling for themselves. As cities have gotten a bit more liberal towards the homeless recently for instance, we are seeing individuals put up tents on the sidewalks. You've even got the rare story of someone who uses plywood or wood pallets to construct a more sturdy cabin. Imagine what they could do if they had the legal right to a 8-ft x 8 ft space.  I agree with those who say that homelessness is a government created problem
10rib4u,,j6zv19f,There was a community of very poor homeless people living in shacks that they had built themselves at the Albany California dump. The homeless lived their for years but then the government destroyed their homes.  Get a parking lot. Build a toilet, a sink and a shower. Then give the lot to somebody or a charity willing to put up with legal liability because when one homeless person kills another homeless person the family members of the dead homeless person will sue whoever owns the parking lot even though these family members of the dead homeless person would do nothing to help their homeless family member and had not even seen their homeless family members in years. Nice people might help the homeless more if helping the homeless did not have legal liability.  But you now have a parking lot with the legal liability situation under control and a toilet a shower and a sink so invite the homeless to build homes and the homeless will build homes.
10rib4u,,j6wdhi2,The free market would build whatever can make money building. The greatest pent up demand is for small houses. From a construction sense with the pent up demand small houses are more profitable.  But if you must pay a lot for the right to build you want to maximize you profit on your zoning / building permit by building a large house. A problem thinking about this is separating the value of the land from the value of the zoning and the building permit.
10rib4u,,j6wzt2m,I'm a free market capitalist, ready to buy a huge pot of land and build a community of shipping containers to rent out for extremely cheap, i would make alot of profit and dwellers get cheap rent. But unfortunately red tape gets in the way. I don't want to build luxury apartments because it's too much and i would have to charge people way too much rent. It beats the purpose of my visionary goals.
10rib4u,,j6xndl1,What red tape is there?  Are you talking about the need for these tiny homes to meet fire code standards or are you referring to the need to be linked to infrastructure such as electric grid, sewer system, roads (public transit)?
10rib4u,,j6zj8pf,Tiny homes on tiny lots are just plain banned by zoning in most of the land of the USA.
10rib4u,,j722nwt,Infastructure, set backs, parking, insulation, i could probably go on.  People in Mexico have corrugated metal shacks with no utilties and in the process have better housing than millions of homeless Americans.   So every reason why a person can't put up a metal shack with a lock where they can then begin to build a life, that's the red tape.
10rib4u,,j6xpjbq,Being stationed overseas, we lived in shipping containers, obviously modified to meed American standards to us. No restroom but had electricity and even wifi you can connect to(have to pay for a subscription though). Also a AC unit in there. I'm sure there's alot willing to pay for a bare bone basic shipping container room. For a few hundred dollars.
10rib4u,,j6zizqn,I bought a piece of land that thanks to a new California state law I will be allowed to build 8 tiny homes on.
10rib4u,,j70flx7,[deleted]
10rib4u,,j70fp7x,500 square feet.  I am allowed to build bigger houses but because I did not pay that much for the land I think the greatest need and highest profit will be for small houses.  I plan to make them all handicapped accessible. I want them each to have a 70 tiny square foot 2nd bedroom in case a caregiver needs sleep over.
10rib4u,,j6zthuk,A free market would only build market rate housing but some businesses would fill the market niche of supplying market rate  extremely affordable tiny hoses if the government allowed that.  Subsidized housing is strange. The government does not allow new affordable housing which makes the cost of existing housing that was once affordable rise. Then the government which caused the shortage of affordable housing complains that the market is not building affordable housing and so the government subsidizing housing for a few lucky people.  If you have homes for 100 people but you have 110 that need homes but you only allow the builders to build 1 home what is the market value  of the permission to build 1 home.? What kind of home should you build to maximize the return on the asset that the permission to build one home is?  If you have 100 homes and 110 people that need homes and you subsidize the one of the 10 homeless people to rent one of the 100 homes what have you done? So one of the 10 homeless can use that subsidy to our bid 100 of the 100 houses people for a home. You have increased the supply of renter money demanding homes but you have not increased the supply of homes. So the homeless person with the subsidy displaces one of the houses people and this displaced person is now homeless so the subsidy does not decrease homelessness but only pushes up the rents.  The subsidy should attract new home builders by driving up rents but the rents were already plenty high enough to attract home builders but the government has created a scarcity of buildable lots and the government won‚Äôt allow affordable homes to be built on the few buildable lots. If the builders pay too much for the buildable kit then the builder can not afford to build an affordable home.
10rib4u,,j734l19,> 20 year old computer programmers, so... worse smell.  LOL...
10rib4u,,j75t6qf,The housing market in San Francisco might be capitalism but it certainly is not free market capitalism.
10rib4u,j6vsnlk,,Local governments oppose affordable housing. In 1895 immigrants lived in tenement housing that local governments would not allow to be built today. Local government wants tax base; as few people as possible living in houses that are as expensive as possible.  The collective effects of local building regulation is the biggest reason for homelessness (bugger than drug addiction, alcoholism and mental illness combined).  Homelessness is a government created problem.
10rib4u,,j6vtx6z,Yeah, damn the government for implementing sanitation regulations and building codes that require houses to be able to withstand storms and provide indoor plumbing.
10rib4u,,j6vu4c6,Let them build small apartments. Sanitation regulation is fine but if people can not afford 400 square foot apartments then build 150 square foot apartments that are illegal based on being too small in most of the USA.  Most people would prefer tiny apartments to sharing a bedroom.

10rib4u,,j6xpule,[deleted]
10rib4u,,j6zhn9q,aka the projects
10rib4u,,j6ziig1,If you legalize affordable housing everywhere it will not create ghettos because the poor will be scattered everywhere.  People in San Franciscans as liberal as they are do not want poor people living next door to their million dollar closets that they sleep in but having a poor person living  next door with a toilet of their own is better than having a poor person living in the sidewalk in front of your home and pooping on your doorstep .  I hear that the wealthy in Rio de Janeiro have a solution to poor people  living near their homes. They just pay off duty police to shoot and kill poor people living too close to them. But the liberal San Franciscans are not ready to start killing the poor yet.  Dispersed ghettos are not ghettos. America did not legalize snob snob Zoning until Euclid vs Ambler in 1926.  America chose to send industrial jobs out of America. That did not just happen to America, it was a choice. America chose to import cheap labor that was a choice. America chose to help landlords get rich at the expense of the poor and chose to segregate the poor drone the wealthy so the wealthy would not have to live in the same towns as poor people; that was a choice.  The ghettos we have would not be as bad if we allowed the poor to live everywhere. Builders can make good money building homes  that poor people can afford if the government changed the rules to allow a free market.  I have never been wealthy enough to not be traumatized by the price of my rent.  I a white person from a upper middle class family have usually chosen to live borderline ghettos with moderately high crime and few white people because I got a discount for putting up with fairly high crime neighborhoods  without many white people. I never lived in hard core ghettos but I lived in places that middle class white people are scared of. I am glad that so many middle class whites where racists scare of crime because them being scared racists saved me a lot of money on rent. Ghetto helped me but even I am scared of the hard core ghettos and stuck to borderline ghetto.
10rib4u,,j6zetem,What if every city and town and rural zoning district passes laws that require Landlords to not rent to below median income people and requiring that home owners don‚Äôt sell their homes to below median income people. Then half of Americans would become homeless by law.  Why should the old urban core cities be forced to deal with the problems of poverty while the suburbs get to exclude poor people?  It is illegal to discriminate against gender, race and the disabled  people and to some degree in some places LGBTQ but it is perfectly legal to discriminate against poor people.   Poor people are not protected from discrimination and you are allowed to pass laws that discriminate against poor people.  A zoning law requiring a minimum lot size to build a home or a minimum home size or single family detached homes is legal discrimination against poor people.   Even if only 90% of Cities and towns and and rural counties decide to discriminate against poor people there are too many poor people for the remaining towns that don‚Äôt discriminate against the poor to meet the housing demand of the poor.  When America discriminates against housing for the poor and the lower middle class America is changing supply and demand.  Squeezing the supply of affordable homes for the lower middle class means that the lower middle class rent all the homes that the poor could afford the poor are left with few homes to chose from and the very poor have nothing that they can afford and so become homeless.  There were very homeless around when I was young  and it wasn‚Äôt  because of a lack of mental illness and addiction. When I was young a young married couple  of two 23 year olds with a baby could buy a starter home with even though the guy worked 50 hours a week as a cashier for 7-11 and the wife worked 20 hours a week at 7-11 and took care of her baby. Now they can not afford that starter home and they are living in the appartment that the low functioning very poor would have lived in had the functional young couple not displaced them. And the displaced low functioning  poor people can no longer afford a roof over their head.  San Francisco metro area is surrounded by open space that is for recreation and just to keep housing off of the hills because while we are suck I a traffic jam on our 1 hour commutes we prefer staring at empty hills rather than hills filled with starter homes.  The government created open space  in the San Francisco metropolitan area probably is be bigger than the the built on land if you include the cattle grazing land that it is illegal to build homes on. Then we have immigration. Why are we importing cheap labor if our own people  can barely afford their homes because of a government created scarcity of housing?  Don‚Äôt blame the free market. We don‚Äôt have a free market.  We have investors hoarding buildable lots waiting for the government created artificial scarcity of buildable lots to drive up the prices of the buildable lots. Only when the empty lot price becomes a half million dollars for  a 1/6th  acre patch of dirt will the land speculator sell his land to the home builder. When the home builder pays 1/2 million dollars for a piece of dirt apron which he is only allowed to build 1 single family detached home he can not build a starter home.   I have own a 40 acre parcel covered with Redwoods in Mendocino county a 2 1/2 hour drive from San Francisco. Mendocino county has a 600 acre minimum lot size for new subdivisions.  Because of an overkill  fire law that was a result of the Oakland hills fire I would have to pay $100,000 in road work for my drive mile long driveway to upgrade it to allow 2 fire trucks to pass each other every 100 feet of fairly high quality gravel road..   I must sell that money to somebody that can afford to legally build.   I have another 1 acre property within a built up part of Crescent City 6 hours from San Francisco. A new pro affordable housing California state law will allow me to build 8 houses on that lot on which only a single family home used to be allowed.  The new California law will not solve the California housing crisis but it will help.  I  might be too sick, too close to death to even get a single home built for myself but it is my intention to build 8 tiny homes in my one acre parcel and try create a community for disabled people sharing 1 caregiver.  Crescent city only needs homes and has homeless because not everybody pushed out of the San Francisco area chooses to move to Idaho. I figure some people will choose Crescent City when they are forced out of the San Francisco area.
10rib4u,,j6vvpnk,It's the same government that insists on a tradition of traumatizing human beings with congregate shelters.  People need private, safe homes in order to heal.
10rib4u,j6w9bx5,,Yeah we have those in Norman Oklahoma. Smally home area encampments.

10rib4u,j6xu7ep,,Sorry but in the eyes of the tyrants, it does not make sense because it doesn't make dollars. I live in a one man tent at the moment, one day I was coming back from daily errands and looked down at my little setup thinking "the space I'm using at the moment is 6Lx4Wx4H... Why not make a portable pod for homeless people that size?" You know what stopped me? [this](https://youtu.be/0zkrH6yquWM) also there was a guy named Elvis supplying sound solutions for California what happen to him? [this...](https://youtu.be/n6h7fL22WCE) all because the people that a financially stable didn't want to see the tiny homes on the streets... in the same spots where the person had a tent... which makes no sense to me ...but in the city's defense they returned the houses (not the belongings though which is stupid) and made a couple tiny home "villages" but the damage was already done. There are so many ideas you can find around the internet that would put a dent in homelessness, crime, and costs for repair and maintenance around areas where poverty is congregated, but where are they fully implemented? And before someone brings up Finland, they don't have a national drug and psychological problem that north america does. Sure they like to party a bit from time to time but I'm pretty sure it's nothing like here. The housing first initiative would work, but who's going to pay for it in the long run (is what the governments think...)
10rib4u,,j74hi9y,During the Great Depression homeless Americans were often allowed to build shacks on land that they did not own.   These tent cities turned into shack cities were called Hoovervilles.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooverville  When there are enough homeless and the homeless are not being blamed for their own homelessness people start tolerating and caring about the homeless.

But no you had to smash all my tent posts and shred my tent with your claws to get my melon.  Bears; what are you going to do with them?
10rib4u,,j722c42,Are we still on the same topic?
10rib4u,,j6zpwq9,I lived in a Residential hotel once also known a a SRO, Single room occupancy similar to a boarding home or a tenement.  I had my own toilet but the shower was done the hall. My  building was grandfathered in but it was no longer legal o build buildings like that.    I did census work in some big residential hotel SROs in downtown Oakland. A cheap SRO can keep a person from becoming homeless. SROs were once very common but around 1970 just when towns were starting to ban affordable housing and when America seemed to be in the verge of overcoming poverty America was tearing down the SRO‚Äôs as being unweeded and underused because even our poor were starting to be too wealthy to want tiny affordable housing. 1970 was the peak of American prosperity if measured in how much housing and food and cars will your paycheck but but if measured in the quality of computer games and hand held computing and internet then we live in the wealthiest time now. But I can‚Äôt eat phone apps or sleep in phone apps.  Most Americans had a great great grand parent immigrant that lived in a room with it‚Äôs own lock but had a shared bathroom down the hall. That would be affordable housing for the homeless but it is illegal  now in most towns to build and rent housing like that.  Rather than allow the building of housing like that towns want to have their police harass the homeless into moving to the next town.
10rib4u,,j7228ac,Cool man
10rib4u,,j6zqowk,Homeless have some money. Even if the homeless  earn money by begging they can pay some rent and would pay some rent if the rent was cheap enough. The homeless would like a place where they can sleep safely and undisturbed preferably with a toilet and a sink and a shelf and a lock on their door. In a free market minimal housing would cost very little.   But we don‚Äôt have a free market.

10rib4u,,j70gpjk,I think your friend is probably right. The politics would probably kill it. In a small town where all the homeless grew up in the town and people know them I thought no it might be more possible.  People would rather pretend that the homeless don‚Äôt exist.

10rfwn2,j6ydbfb,,Depends on where you go. The west is riddled with tweakers, bur way more cool people. You would make more money panhandling out east, but it can get lonely. The west can become a black hole if you aren't careful. The east has way less public land, and people aren't as open minded.   Housing would be easier to get in the northeast, but it's cold right now. The northeast is the easiest/quickest spot to get housing. If you want to have fun with cool people fo out west, if you want to get housing go the new england.
10rfwn2,,j6z8nux,I have only been out on the west coast once (about 35 years ago) and yeah, I definitely ran into some pretty cool and amazing people. People out there do seem to be pretty open. Got invited to stay with random strangers or invited into thier house for a drink. Lots of experiences like that. In the East, which is where I've spent most of my life, things like that would rarely happen because a lot of people are suspicious, afraid and more likely to call the cops on you than to invite you in for a beer. I can't really speak for NE because most of my time was spent from KY on down to FL. FL was really cool but I hear now that it's pretty anti-homeless.
10rfwn2,,j74bjq3,Yes, if you stay out of the big cities it will be great! Florida is notoriously bad for travelers or being homeless. The climate is nice in the winter but that's about it.

10rfwn2,j6vk3rq,,Oh very berry I wish you'd post about your situation and let people help you stay housed. You said you're not in housing lists because you don't want to be homeless where you are, but with housing you wouldn't be homeless. And you can get on lists not in your area too.
10rfwn2,,j6vln23,Fair enough and I appreciate your reply!. I am currently housed and have been living here for a long time but due some recent events (which has given me severe cPTSD) I have been hanging precariously on the edge of homelesness.  I'm not quite "there" yet or ready/comfortable about getting on a list just now and honestly, don't even know where I would go if I were to need to move. For now, I guess I'm just trying to get educated and posting makes me feel less alone and since I was homeless myself for many years, this feels like a safe space for me at the moment.  The state I am living in is supposed to be terrible for the homeless so I probably wouldn't stay in this state. I'm torn between going back up north or heading out to the west coast if I ever actually did end up homeless again.
10rfwn2,,j6zdiuj,I would literally get on any open list and evaluate the area when my turn came up but I mean, where the housing is would seem the best place to be to me. What is your source of income, disability?
10rey5w,j6vkkqd,,I don‚Äôt think this will help tonight, but get a nalgene or similar from a thrift store. Gas stations or McDonald‚Äôs will have hot water you can fill it with. You need insulation. Cardboard works well for the ground. A lot of stores throw out cardboard boxes every day. A lot of thrift stores have sleeping bags and blankets. Those will insulate you from the elements and if you do the water bottle, keep that warmth towards you.  For tonight, it‚Äôs going to really suck. Ask McDonald‚Äôs if they have any cardboard, and if you can get enough for 3+ layers between you and the ground. The pines will help block the wind as long as it isn‚Äôt too muddy for you to stay dry with the cardboard.   Idk how much snow there is, but if you can use a snow drift to block the wind do it
10rey5w,,j6vsw89,Forgot to mention this, but set alarms for every couple hours and get up and get warm (jumping jacks if you have to) if you wake up cold.
10rey5w,j6vkuq3,,Bus station. Hospital lobby/waiting room.
10rey5w,j6vpsri,,I second the idea of a psych hospital but not the same way as the above poster
10rey5w,j6xyr7k,,Ok... Things to get...  1. Enough cardboard to make a four layer bed 2 enough cardboard to make blankets (2 layers) if you don't have 3. An empty beer or beverage can 4. A condom (bare with me...) 5 as many garbage bags as you can.  First you want to locate a spot where the wind and weather will be minimized. It's a good idea to frequently check the spot throughout the day to get a feel of what people and wildlife will be in the area later.  Once you find the spot and have a fair idea of the atmosphere, you can either store your cardboard close to the spot or carry it around all day. It's totally up to you. If you are going to store the cardboard make sure you cover the majority with a garbage bag or something to reduce the amount of water or moisture the cardboard collects.  Once it is time to sleep or you are ready to "relax for the night", grab your cardboard making 4 layers or as many as possible under you remembering that the most important area you want heat to reflect back to you is your torso and abdomen.   If you don't have a blanket, that's where the extra cardboard comes in (if you have enough which you should, cardboard is free and in trash/recycling bins) there are two ways to go about covering yourself or using cardboard as a blanket.  1 cut the cardboard at the seam making it as long as possible and drape it over you. Not the best idea if it's windy.  2 if the box is wide enough for you to fit your abdomen in lay as many boxes OPEN as you need to cover your body. Like a tunnel on top of the cardboard layers that will reflect your body heat. Crawl into your cardboard tunnel, and flatten the boxes so that most of your body is enclosed. Get back to me on this part if you need further instructions. I'm still figuring out how to word these instructions...  3 For heat just in case you feel the need throughout the day or night, that's where the beverage/beer can and condom come into play. I'm not going to go into instructions on this because there's already a video I posted on YouTube and in this Sub... But you can check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/M6_i8HpoJ8E)  Hope that helps, don't give up, and the better side of you is on the other side of the hill.
10rey5w,j6vgoul,,any resources? cardboard /trash bags for shelter or something to burn? makeshift hot water bottles will keep you hours.  keep something between you and the ground at all times.
10rey5w,j6vgkq6,,minimum two layers of cardboard on the ground. you lose most heat through the ground, regardless of temperature. next one is wind direction, block the wind. head covering, most heat escapes through the head. Never sleep in a plastic bag. Ever. Never ever sleep in a plastic bag. Even your legs. You may not be able to use them the next day. Never ever sleep in a plastic bag. Do not defend your possessions. Do not lose your ID. If you get targeted, they go for your ID. Without your ID they can target you for weeks or months. Your life and your ID are important, not any possession.  Its really quite nice I prefer sleeping outside. I have used the same 0 degree sleeping bag for 20 years.
10rey5w,j6vmg0h,,Waffle House or other 24 hour restaurant
10rey5w,j6wa3m7,,I had a bed at the shelter. I left at 3:30 am because the tweakers kept stomping past my  bed to go out and get high every five minutes.  Coffee shops are all closed because the tweakers fuck up the bathrooms.  I went through the hospital shit list yesterday so I can‚Äôt reuse that. I‚Äôm stuck outside until the library opens at nine.  I‚Äôm not hating on the users. I‚Äôm a former addict myself, but I didn‚Äôt act like an asshole to get high. There‚Äôs no excuse for that so I had to either punch the fucking faces or get out so I left.
10rey5w,j74blri,,Do you have boxes? If I was in your situation i'd find some pallets for a base and some boxes, lay the boxes down on the pallet. Perhaps find some bubble wrap because air is insulating and a garbage bag and fill it with grass and things for more insulation. You can build up a little shelter under some trees and add extra boxes. It will do you till you can find some better materials. Air = insulation. I'll do some more research for you if I can.  How is your panhandling going, have you tried that? Maybe you could get a sleeping bag? Surely someone can spare enough money to get you one. There are some cheap options too.  https://www.walmart.com/ip/Coleman-15-F-Rectangular-Sleeping-Bag/750284800?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&&adid=22222222227275235595&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=375554972082&wl4=pla-630947516878&wl5=9006653&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=750284800&veh=sem&gclid=CjwKCAiA\_vKeBhAdEiwAFb\_nrRpw1Hb\_wf2Lvs\_CnYdbYoUcQD3UM3HNT44-NUPYSOr28p3iQTcNbxoCwxwQAvD\_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

You are free of their implications as soon as you get your shit together.  What you're going to do is apply to different universities and grants until one of them bites. You will start a career, work part time if you have to, or sleep at shelters if you have to, but you WILL finish and get that degree.  Once you do, aint going to be but a matter of a few years experience, and you'll be making upper-middle class wages with your own house and cars by the time you turn 30. You'll have your own (mentally sane) partner and even some kids maybe. white picket fence, a dog, and a cat.  Don't let ANY diversions stop you. You're going to be okay, bud. Fuck the past, now it's your time to make life.
10rc2gg,,j6v3djw,I'm on my way to earning 2 degrees to transfer while also becoming a nurse. Manager from another job stole me from where I was making $15 bc apparently i have great customer service and now I make 16.25. The Lord loves me. I want to look after my family first, i wont adandon them. Get a nice big house where I can have a giant desk with books and computers and paints and get my momma one of those beds that have controls. My dad a new wheelchair, my brother a new baseball bat, my uncle his own room bc hes my everything. I've always wanted to become a mom, I don't like cats, would love a fence of any kind. It's just a matter of time. Thank you

10rc2gg,,j6vexz4,You've got this.  I lost a lot of my youth to homelessness as well. I dropped out of high school after a single week because I was homeless and couldn't manage everything on my own. I was 18 when I finally got into stable housing. I had ups and downs and had a couch serf once or twice after that, but eventually, I found my footing, and I haven't been without a home in a very long time. I'm 35 now. College was really my turn-around. That was when I got shit really figured out. I spent a few extra years at Community College, finding my path and getting free grants to help pay my bills, then I found steady work, finished my BA, went on to get and MA while teaching undergrad college students, and now I have a good career, a super cool son, and a wonderful fiance, with whom I'm moving into a beautiful single-family house next month!   I tell you all this because I've been where you are now. I've felt the same longing, sadness, and struggle. And I can see the path ahead of you is bright. You've fucking got this. You might still be wading through the sludge right now, but it's not much further until the best of times.   Keep up with your studies. Be gentle with yourself. And know that you will overcome all of this for a better future.
10rc2gg,j6v6xqy,,Hey sweetheart, idk how helpful this will be but I‚Äôm really proud of you for sticking to your goals and working towards something bigger. When I was 18 I was also in a really shitty situation but now I‚Äôm 22 and I‚Äôm on my way to finishing my degree, I have my own apartment and things I couldn‚Äôt dream of before. Things change really abruptly sometimes for the better. One day you have nothing and all of a sudden you have a car. An apartment. A degree. A better paying job. A lover. All these things will find you in due time. If you‚Äôre exhausted, rest. But don‚Äôt lose sight of the bigger picture
10rc2gg,j6veapq,, Advise, break the cycle of poverty and generational curses.   Stay in school get your Degree, but also live for you! I know you want to take care of everyone but you need to have some fun yourself. Not sure if you are in High School or College but take the steps to get a license if you do not have one, and then a car for yourself even a good used one and find people and places to enjoy yourself.    I take it you contribute to the family account? Then stand your ground with your Mother you are legal and there is no reason not to see friends.
10rc2gg,j6vejqv,,Have you asked anyone at your school for help?
10rc2gg,j6x0l9t,,PLEASE dont lose hope. You are sooooo young and you have your whole life ahead of you.   First of all I would leave that living situation, Ask coworkers if you can stay with them for a couple months until you find another place. Reach out on craigslist or university college sites or boards for a roommate.   You realize your living situation is toxic so you can leave ANYTIME. you are 18. Apply for grants.....talk to a counsellor at the school that is what they are for....keep working and earning income....you are on the right track. Dont let your family bring you down.
10rc2gg,,j6yao6b,I'm not leaving my family. I appreciate it but it's just not in my cards. I support them, i love them. The motel we stay at is in a pretty bad place so i understand why i cant always go out, but it just feels too excessive sometimes. my dad is an amputee and my mothers health isn't the best. They support me and my school. It's toxic bc we're so tired of this place, not of each other. But I appreciate you. I wish i didnt work so i can nust focus on school. I do fully plan on going to a bigger college and have talked to different counselors ^^ just did yesterday. Deadline for scholarships ended for me but I already secured letters of recs from admin for when i transfer. My eyes just hurt sometimes. I would get a job at my school but I feel bad quitting on my manager, but I'm thinking about it. My current job pays better though. I just have to make another decision:)

10rc2gg,,j6y84ni,You don't know how their actual family is outside of this post, and it's kinda ridiculous to pretend otherwise.  Of course there are toxic families. My family was broken at a young age. I'm the oldest of four. If I were to have fun off on my own, I would've left my mom, still working through her traumas from my pops, would've had to handle everything on her own. Was life wonderful time? No. Not really for any of us. But I got a job under the table, and helped raise my siblings.  Everyone has their own journey, and you can't just ignore the nuances.
10rc2gg,,j6yai0y,And neither do you I‚Äôm posting based on the OP post, not your opinion
10rc2gg,,j6yb8g8,And I'm only playing devil's advocate. Nobody should just straight up tell people they don't know, who are obviously in a vulnerable, high-stress situation, to run away. That's insane. So I'm pointing out the other side.   Also, judging by "quince", they are Hispanic. Are you Hispanic? Do you have any genuine knowledge on the cultural differences you might have?

10rc2gg,j6wji1s,,I‚Äôm so sorry. I spent 5 years of my life as a pre-teen to teen living in a single motel room with my parents and a sibling. I slept on a couch that slanted so I had to do 180¬∞ flips several times per night to get even pressure.  Open a savings account under your name without your family‚Äôs knowledge. Keep the password to yourself and the security questions answers different from what they mean. Save, save, and keep saving.  At the same time, really focus on school. Sorry, has to be studies that others find too difficult and so employers demand it and will pay more for it. Really research the field and job prospects.  Hopefully, you can get financial aid, hopefully scholarships, and good job offers. Get out and stay out, so you don‚Äôt get pulled back down by requests or demands for your time and money at will suck you dry.
10rc2gg,j6xr2et,,The lower down on the socioeconomic ladder, the harder you have to push to make progress, cheap food can be nutritious, you just have to sacrifice taste and convenience, everything becomes easier  once you start seeing real progress. never lose the drive and pieces literally fall into place, don't get caught up in drugs or alcohol or you will be in a deeper hole, this life is composed of a lot of false bottoms, don't get caught thinking things couldn't get worse. You are capable of more than you could ever imagine if you truly believe in yourself and accept that things suck but not forever. My mental health kept me from finishing college, I had so much potential and wasted it cause I was too caught up overthinking about what bad things could happen.

10qiy3k,j6rqq5z,,Not sure where you got this idea, but relax. Breathe. It's all good. I've lived in crappy shelters in two states and they didn't care what my id said. Same with food stamps. As long as you don't have an open assistance case in another state, you can get ebt where you currently reside.  Also your local shelters/social worker may be able to help you get a local id fyi, and there's no "one year" residency requirement.
10qiy3k,,j6tcwvg,Thank you!. Where is this if you don't mind me asking?.
10qiy3k,j6qcdgr,,seems to me that folks here have mentioned that NYC doesn't do that.  unsure about NY though
10qiy3k,,j6qcvp6,Well, at least thats good to know but I wonder about the other states/cities. I think some food banks and such have a policy of "no questions asked" and basically take the position that "who cares who you are. You are a human being and hungry so we will feed you". Not sure about other states or services though.
10qiy3k,j6qgzwp,,Not sure about services, but most of the shelters here in Dallas take anyone with an ID. Doesn't have to be from Texas. I doubt most shelters do background checks. That would be too expensive.  Food banks here don't require ID, but a lot of them only serve limited areas (usually certain ZIP codes) so you need proof that you live in that area.   I don't think there's a residency requirement for food stamps since it's a federal program (although states contribute). I think there's a waiting period if you're not a US citizen, but as long as you are, you should be good. You can only get food stamps in the state in which you are living, though.
10qiy3k,j6s4noz,,I haven‚Äôt had that experience in Northern Virginia, I got accepted into one despite not being in the state for over a year.  I‚Äôve lived there previously but moved and had to come back for a short whole before I went into the shelter.

10qgckj,j6qyx4m,,Alright. I'm a Waffle House Cook. So here's how it is. First of all, if you think you're fooling us with lies and sob stories you're foolin' yourself. We've seen it all, and we can detect bullshit at 300 yards. That being said, on a cold night, where space is available, we ain't gonna say shit so long as you're not causing trouble. Most of us will probably offer you drinks, and maybe some food. Don't use that as an excuse to try and take advantage of us. We'll see through that too. But, again, as long as you aren't being an asshole, we probably won't be either. Of course, I can't actually speak for every Waffle House in existence, but as a general rule, a peaceable escape from the elements in a Waffle House is far from your worst choice. Use your sense, read the room, be polite, and don't annoy your server. (Seriously, Do Not...you have been watching YouTube lately?) Treat us with respect, and most of the time we will reciprocate. You can get out of this. It's hard, (and I Do know,) but brighter days are ahead. You can get through. Just "keep swimming!"
10qgckj,,j6riax3,Thank you for your service. I've weathered more than a few bad nights in a waffle house. I've also been hooked up by the staff before a lot. Even times when I'm in there eating with the full intention of paying for my meal. I've gone to pay and they told me it was all taken care of. I still treasure my waffle house princess pin a server gave me one time. My white whale is one of those dope golden waffles though.

10qgckj,j6q29xn,,Little white lies aren't a bad idea. Car broke down, waiting on a ride. I was genuinely waiting on a ride once and asked a hotel clerk for permission to hang. Hotel lobbies usually have coffee. This one had cookies too :-)
10qgckj,,j6q2w0p,This is an area with high crime/drug use so the homeless are discriminated against everywhere. I could tell we were recognized immediately, no one has ever asked if we would like a menu.

Just new to this, need to calm down.
10qgckj,,j6sy4sg,I realize that this might sound very specific... but try to find a 24 hour non-chain coffee shop.. or coffee/donut shop.  You had good luck at this Waffle House... but the chain itself has rules, and at some point, someone working there is going to want to enforce them.  It is one of the problems seeking shelter at any kind of retail chain organization.  At some point, they can and will fall back to using some variation of the phrase "I'm sorry, it's just our Policy." on you... because in doing so, they can pass the responsibility on to someone above them.  With finding a non-chain shop, you are dealing with the policies of an owner... potentially an owner-manager.  One person can bend their rules easier than an organization can bend their rules.  The situation you are in can be appealed to an actual person where the buck stops.  They can \*see\* you aren't trouble, and maybe they can even help, or trade light work for product.  They are far more likely to wave off "insurance concerns" than some large corporation operating a few thousand locations around the country.  Probability.  Probability, versus possibility.  Like.. playing the odds.  You have better odds at getting sympathetic treatment from an individual than you are from an organization.  Thus... seeking shelter at odd hours with a high degree of probability that they would be sympathetic to your situation, means looking for independent businesses as opposed to chains.  It is also more probable that one could trade sweeping or taking out trash, for coffee, at an independent coffee shop versus any kind of chain shop or restaurant.  This is a Google template search for "[local 24 hour coffee shop](https://www.google.com/search?q=local+24+hour+coffee+shop)" and when you follow it, it will show the 24 hour coffee shops near you.  Check out any and all of the independent ones.  You could even rotate between a few, so as not to spend two nights in a row at the same one.  Also... with 24 hour coffee/donuts... as cheezy as it sounds... the police become an asset as opposed to a threat.  If you are there, and the people in charge have no issues with you being there, when the cops show up for coffee, they are actually looking out for you as just another patron, instead of just looking for you as something to be removed.  And of course, just about all of them have free WiFi, just like their corporate cousins.  You also have a higher probability of being able to just get hot water, because you brought your own tea bags/hot chocolate packets.  Less corporate means less pressure on profit per hour, per table.  At least, a higher probability of less focus on those things at an independent coffee shop.  At least, this gives you a goal and direction for nights, while you figure out what to do.  I'd hit libraries during the day.
10qgckj,,j6s753m,Not paranoid.  Backpacks are a dead giveaway.  No shame in it. Most people that are exposed to us on a daily basis treat us respectfully.  As long as we respect their spaces, of course.  Sometimes you may have to clean up someone else‚Äôs mess just to keep the peace. Especially bathrooms.
10qgckj,j6qo2xs,,I have also been having an existential crisis since 2020
10qgckj,j6qnsqx,,Get food stamps asap.  With that, you qualify for Obama phone.  Free phone and plan. Look for garage sales and free stuff on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist to stay warm. Dont waste money like that $20.  Go to Walmart and the dollar tree.  Especially the dollar tree. Microwave cheap romin at the gas stations.   Find a shelter if your state has one. Try calling 211 or 311 for resources.
10qgckj,,j6r32tu,This^ also Worth finding a planet fitness too and joining. Access to lockers, showers, and a safe place.
10qgckj,,j6s8c17,Some truck stop gas stations and rest areas have plugs and showers (rare in florida) but free. 24 hour gym is better if you have the money.  Google the gym name and deals.  I found a reddit deal with a code like 6 months ago to join planet fitness fir only $1 including all fees and first month. Get a costco pay card.  It's better than a membership (never expires let you in anytime to use it).  Buy the cheap $1.50 hot dogs comes with drink.  Pizza as well.  The pay and you can put money on it and when it runs out you just use regular payment.  So just act like oh I didn't know it ran out kinda thing then get groceries.  They won't ask for it for the food.  Idea has some cheap hot food as well.  Taco bell has the cheapest best fast food.  Ranch burrito which is a good size is $2-$2.50 depending on the region.  Ask for a water cup (free) then fill it with soda.  At Costco or taco bell fill a giant container with soda for later with ice (free).  Circle k has sip and save. 7$ for one month of one drink per day included.  Coffee, cold brew, iced tea, soda, iceys etc.  Get any size cup.  Extra large of course.  Use any cup for any drink. I got two memberships.  2 drinks a day.  Panerai bread has similar thing with different drinks 11$ish bucks a month first month free on app!  Great place to sit and charge your devices.

10qgckj,,j6td2fl,That‚Äôs pretty recent in history. Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have stopped. Especially given how much the person they claim to emulate would never have stopped it, would have praised keeping it up in the first place etc.   Naturally having someone there trained is also best but‚Ä¶ it seems churches are more a vanity thing now. A lot of people go just to be able to say they did or be seen doing it.
10qgckj,,j6tz3ed,I agree. I went there as a teen seeking temporary shelter and guidance during a very dark time and found the doors locked.  It really messed me up. Stopped attending mass completely, actually.
10qgckj,,j6tzjx7,Yeah. It‚Äôs very‚Ä¶ ‚Äòeven god will not help me‚Äô and some go to ‚Äòthere is no god‚Äô etc.   I was abused by church people in the first place so for me I went another path besides those, went the path of my mother before she died but without the forced conversion holding her kids over her head stuff.   I could never be Christian but the actual things they are supposed to do are actually respectable as opposed to what actually goes down.

Or - look for a church & ask permission to sleep a few nights out of the week in the parking lot. Maybe you could offer to sweep the area/pick up litter in exchange for parking?

10qeete,j6qlbny,,Google "Boondocking"; basically places that you can legally camp or otherwise stay for free for a limited amount of time (like 7-14 days a month usually). The one's local to me are adajcent to rest stops where you can park. You can just sleep in the truck or pitch the tent or whatever. You'll probably have to sign in or similar with security, and don't try to overstay your welcome. However, if you've got two boondock spots within driving distance of one another that give you 2 weeks each you can just bounce back and forth between them since you have wheels.

That led me to reject staying in a dorm shelter.  You'll also likely find that the only options for shelter are "sober-living," as if alcohol was only made for the rich. That leaves them no other place to go except to suffer their addictions on the street, accompanied with people pretending to be your friend offering drugs.

10q2vod,j6rxjsd,,SSI, Snap, ebt all work with no actual address. Was homeless in Madison County AL free years ago, I know it's not a state requirement. Also, there are multiple organizations and shelters that have staff whose sole job is assisting with paperwork for benefits id's and such at no cost to the individual. If you're being fed the no one will help line cut the person telling you this out of the equation and look into resources.     So, seperate from that a few things you will want to look in to. 1 gym or campground membership. These places have shower/restroom facilities you can use, are cheap, just don't stay there all day every day. 2 libraries are your friend, as a resource for info/net access, a place with free water via fountains, and a place to escape the elements. Nothing worse than being stuck outside in freezing or wet weather. Or stuck in 95 degree humid swamp in the summer. 3 if staying local locate your nearest food banks, soup kitchens, and cheaper grocery stores like food value, aldis, dollar general/tree. 4 Keep toothbrush tooth paste and dry socks available. Like honestly you're better off skipping a meal than not having dry socks and clean teeth. Infected feet or infection in the mouth are both extremely painful and pretty much require a hospital visit. It's not worth the risk.
10q2vod,j6og2th,,Get a back scratcher from dollar general.  This is the only thing no one will mention.  Its $1.25.   You will need it.

10q2vod,,j6qf58c,They do not
10q2vod,j6nibaq,,Zillow. Find a bank in your county, walk in. Explain how much your check is, tell them they can have it all, you only need 2 acres somewhere in Alabama to list as your address so you do not lose the check. Do not accept a rental, or anything fancy. Take a run down rotten hoarder property, anything to maintain an Alabama address. Tell them you can handle all the normal people needs like toilets and utilities some other way. All you need from them is a place to put in a garden and have a physical and legal address. Most banks have too many houses and they prefer monthly payments. Do not get big ideas, get the worst, cheapest one, so you can pay it off the fastest. Tell them you have all the other details worked out without them and you di not feel comfortable with a long term mortgage. Visit about 6 dozen banks.

10q2vod,,j6va9mh,I once had a wild idea to ask churches and charities if i could park in their lots over night, sometimes. When i became homeless i ended up in my car in a place where homelessness doesn't exist. Shitboxes houses that i would never buy sell for $1 million +/-. I asked one charity if they are affiliated with any churches in the area. They are not. After walking and driving around the area i've realized the wealthier population is much worse than where i came from. They don't give time of day and snow in winter. Now i feel extremely uncomfortable asking churches for anything.   Anyone who's near participating religious organizations that openly advertise and offer services are lucky. Not where i am. Homelessness is criminalized and non-existent here. Even post offices refuse to provide mail service for homeless, told me they don't participate, don't know what it is, no one ever asked.
10q2vod,j6v8g9n,,I'm already homeless but don't get SSI because the idea is to deny until my problem resolves itself or i become exhausted and disappear.  I don't think you need an address for SSI payments. It goes into your bank account. My local bank needs an address for me to create an account. I gave my old address because i haven't updated any of my documents and have no new address or proof of any address. I won't be able to pay $24 to the state to update my license every 4 years. I'm not worried about updating and not going to waste money on this nonsense especially if i have no address and no support for at least decent safe housing. I want a tiny space with a private bathroom and shower but i want it in a trailer or container or a tiny home, not in a high risk population area.  Doesn't SSI allow you to apply for a housing voucher? I'm in nj. The system here labels and criminalizes all homeless. It forced everyone into dangerous shelters. I refused. Whoever refuses to go to a shelter is not really homeless. My idiot disability lawyer told me in the beginning i'd be able to get housing when i get SSI but social services told me housing is not guaranteed even for disabled. In other words i'm on my own regardless of my circumstances. There's no support. I'm unable to get usps mail service for homeless. All locations refuse because they don't participate. No homeless population here. I told agencies including soc services and soc security not to send me any mail because i have no address. They continue to send mail to my old address. They can't have the address blank.
10q2vod,,j7muz5o,I was told that if I didn't have an address where I paid rent that the amount was reduced. I know that's true for the temporary cash assistance until your ask is approved but I didn't verify if true for the actual SSI. My cash assistance with a place is $233 a month. I pay $7O rent and electric was 50ish but rates almost doubles so probably $100. I get $63 a month. I use MMJ and that's out now. My doctor just prescribed me Marinol which is synthetic THC in a pill to hopefully help since the marijuana works so well. Otherwise I have to go up on gabapentin  a nd up on my Klonopin. Its already hard to be coherent on my Gabapentin. Im going to be half unconscious drool drooling.
10q2vod,,j7ndz2m,Gabapentin and a few others are pills of choice for pill pushers. Pharma must be giving them good incentives to push gabapentin and others. I've been offered it but i refuse. I'd rather be in pain. Not terrible now but eventually it'll progress.

10przqa,,j6n582v,Yeah lol as soon as you say how it is and that the males are absolutely exploited in child support cases you'll get downvoted. No one gives a fk about males in this world.
10przqa,,j6macwa,That's really sad... I know kids need support, but the system that is in place in most states is really fucked up and doesn't factor that the parent paying support also has to survive.
10przqa,,j6mao3e,I had 2 jobs, they were taking $298 each CHECK from each job. One paid weekly and the other bi-weekly. $1788 a month is what was going to child support.
10przqa,,j6ni5dr,She probably spent $88 of that on actual child‚Äôs needs.   ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10przqa,,j6mc1dn,Jesus... which state and how many kids? That's insane.
10przqa,,j6mc6le,2 kids. Utah. I had custody, too which was the more frustrating part. it was back child support.
10przqa,,j6mc9h4,Wow... I'm sorry dude. Are things better now?
10przqa,,j6mcdin,Still owe money unfortunately lol. But dealing with it as best I can. Not much else you can do when you owe the government money. But I did finally purchase a condo and things are looking up.
10przqa,,j6mcfz4,Yeah... once they have you on the hook you are screwed. Modern day slavery.
10przqa,j6msn6a,,Yes. Happened to me. Paying child support  caused me to lose my apartment.  No one gives a damn about men in this situation. We have to suffer in silence.In the end, the kids don't give a damn either about me.
10przqa,,j6mzs0m,That's why you don't have kids, especially with shitty women.
10przqa,,j6odzm2,The courts want you to pay them and they pay the women. So they can sic the dogs (police) on you.
10przqa,j6pdc9k,,i knew someone who lived in their car. it‚Äôs not for everyone but always an option
10przqa,j6zu76a,,I lived in a tent. Showered at my X's house. Had a massive breakdown. Still recovering two years later.
10przqa,j6o0t0k,,You ate not homeless just because of child support. And if you are paying more than the state guidelines should have you pay, then file for an adjustment most of this can be done online without an attorney.  The CDL is a good idea....also if you are broke on 1 job then pick up a side gig doing something. Rent a room or rent a house and rent a room out.
10przqa,,j6qqz1n,Basic costs are so out of control now, I can definitely believe extra expenses like this causing homeleness.  It‚Äôs hard enough just to buy damn eggs. At least if you‚Äôre in the US!
10przqa,,j6qsdyk,I realize that but kids are a financial responsibility.  He would have to still help support the kids even if he was still with the mom
10przqa,,j6qua3q,Oh absolutely. He needs to pay for his kids, no matter what. I wish men didn‚Äôt see this as optional.  I‚Äôm just saying that everything is so expensive now, that almost any cost can push you over the edge.  In America, we‚Äôve been taught since birth to be hyper independent. We‚Äôre even put in little cages, often in another room, as infants. But this hyper independent way of living doesn‚Äôt work anymore now everything is so expensive.   Now post-COVID we really need to live and work together to afford anything. We basically gotta instantly learn as adult to somehow live like they do in other countries. Learn to share the expenses for everything. Or at least learn to live like Hispanic and Indian people live in here in the US.   Unless you‚Äôre a huuuge earner, you either work and live as a team now, or you die.
10przqa,,j6qyyyd,I do not see this as optional. But imagine for a moment that 50% of your wages are garnished before you even see your paycheck. Ok.. so get a second job? They will garnish that as well. Get a higher paying job? The parent receiving child support gets to request an adjustment. Now you pay even more.  Fall behind? They fine you, then suspend your passport and drivers license, making it even harder to work. The child never sees the interest and fees that are applied.  I have never missed a payment. NOT ONE PAYMENT. I've missed work due to illness, injury, hurricanes, being laid off, and I've still managed to make every single payment. They still fuck up every so often due to "computer glitches" that cause me to have to miss work to go to the courthouse, and ultimately pay some bogus fine that nobody there has any explanation for.  The child support system is no where near as straight forward as many would like to assume, and generally speaking it is the father that gets continuously screwed over, all while getting to see their children less and less.  &#x200B;  Yeah... it's fucked.
10przqa,,j6r4086,I believe you.  I know father‚Äôs today get fucked over in general. Men are now vastly undervalued and underacknowledged. It‚Äôs gross.  Then you mix in how the government works. They seem to add a LOT of pain and ‚Äúglitches‚Äù to everything.  This must be crushing. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this!  At least know you are valued in REALITY. Maybe not valued by this awful system and this terrible culture‚Ä¶ but in a normal world (a world which still exists in some countries apparently), your kids, the mother of your children, and the community and culture itself would highly value you for supporting your kids.  Bless you for doing so! You‚Äôre doing the right things, even when other people aren‚Äôt.
10przqa,,j6r78sy,Thank you
10przqa,,j6r98yz,You‚Äôre welcome. You deserve to be ax acknloweged.  Although not the same.,I‚Äôm homeless for doing right for my family, too. It sucks to be driven into the ground for being good. We live in a series of very broken, upside down systems  Not to mention that the hardest workers in this world tend to get the least. It‚Äôs all so backwards
10przqa,,j6rdru8,I'm very sorry... feel free to dm if you ever need to vent.
10przqa,,j6rwwde,I don‚Äôt know what state you are in but in AZ second jobs are not garnished for child support.  1099 income like gig driving is a good option for that too
10przqa,,j6qy8tl,I am not homeless as of yet thankfully, and I do financially support my kids.  Yes, I am fully aware that the child support is in place to support my children in my absence as a parent living every day in the same home. My problem is not that there is a system in place, it's that the system that exists is extremely corrupt and broken.   Rents in my area have doubled in the last 3 years. Wages have not kept pace. That is not sustainable. With families living under the same roof you can find ways to resolve many issues, and if necessary move to a different state where things are more affordable. As a father with 50% of my income going to my ex I do not have that option. I cannot simply up and abandon my kids by moving to a different state.   There is absolutely no oversight as to how the child support is spent, and I know for a fact that it has been spent on things that do not involve my children whatsoever. There is absolutely nothing that can be done about that. My ex is free to be a stay at home mom that hasn't had a job in 15 years, but if I fall behind at all my drivers license can get suspended, I get fined, and in worst case scenarios many fathers end up in prison due to being unable to keep up.  Again, I understand WHY there is a system in place, but the one we have currently destroys lives. I really don't think that most people not caught up in the child support system have any idea how often they fuck up, costing hundreds of dollars in unnecessary fines. It is an industry that benefits many other people more than it benefits the children.
10przqa,j6oleas,,Yea got a cheap van and just live in that down by the river now (loves truck stop)
10przqa,j78o5yc,,Knew a guy years ago that became homeless because of child support, then lost visitation because he had no home. He was a great dad loved his kids. Probably wasn't going to till they turn 18
10przqa,,j78v6zp,That is very sad. The system is fucked up when it turns good parents into criminals just for being poor.
10prj7n,j6m3bjk,,Why what‚Äôs up? Are they permanently closing? Just what cali needs
10prj7n,j6mrj37,,Good luck!!!
10prj7n,j6qnuc7,,Sending good thoughts your way. I‚Äôm glad you are somewhere it‚Äôs not too cold at least. Can you get on a bus or train to another shelter?
10ppgr8,j6luse2,,In my car living days I had a squirrel that would come to where I parked and shared my trail mix with. Cool little dude. There's something nice about having an animal friend. It brings you peace and a connection. It's like, here's something that doesn't care about how I look, won't judge me, just wants to hang out and eat peanuts.   It sucks that the dog isn't with you anymore but for the time you had together, that dog was your buddy, and you gave it your care and love. That's something few of us ever get enough of. Know that your dog friend got a lot of love from you, that was a gift you gave it. You were able to show another creature compassion, maybe the most they ever experienced, and there's so many that just don't get any. You did a good thing. Keep making those connections,  keep showing love and compassion.
10ppgr8,j6m14r7,,Yeah I had a black lab that followed me and he had a gimp leg in the back so I felt bad for him. Got myself a room at a pet friendly hotel and decided to take him in. Put some blankets down in the bathroom and let him rest. Closed the door. Walked about 2 miles to Burger King and grabbed some grub. Made it back to the room and opened the door‚Ä¶.immediately smelled shit. Then I noticed all the papers I had and books were chewed up all over the room. Then I noticed a hole through the wall that he had chewed to ge out of the bathroom‚Ä¶I kid you not. The hole was big enough to put a basketball wrapped in a small blanket through‚Ä¶that was the last vagabond dog I tried to save
10ppgr8,,j6mwnzw,He thought you left him.
10plpdt,j6lsmne,,I mean, I get that you're going through a lot but your life story involves buying a house, spending all your savings on Christmas gifts and weekly trips to a thrift store for clothes. People here don't rent or live with relatives,  they live in shelters or in tents or their cars. They're able to log in through free wifi they get at the library or the local Starbucks. Don't get me wrong, it sounds like you're having a tough go, but this may not be the right sub and frankly it's a little hurtful to make the comparison of what you're going through to homelessness.   That being said...  Your husband sounds like he may have budgeting issues as well some control issues. It sounds like he wants to make all the major decisions himself despite your significant contributions to the family. You two need to have a long and frank conversation about your financial goals and how you can achieve them. If he's not on board, then, as much as it would be difficult for the kids, a divorce may be the best option. You are miserable and I'm sure your kids can feel the tension, it's not healthy for them either. It is unfair to you and your kids to have your goals and your hard work to achieve those goals undermined and erased by your husband's poor decisions. Yes, the housing situation is not ideal, and I would say suck it up until you have enough saved...but you're not able to save, so this goes from a temporary stint to a life imprisonment. Unless you can come to an agreement with your husband about the future of your family, your SHARED goals, and what each of you will do to reach them, I would genuinely consider your options on making your goals achievable without him. It sucks. It's a crappy situation with no winners, but unless an agreement can be made and stuck to, it's going to get worse. Good luck and remember, unfortunately,  some people can't change. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, don't chain yourself to a life of misery out of good intentions.
10plpdt,j6le0ym,,Not sure if it applies to this sub but I‚Äôll let others chime in on that.   I would post to r/roomateshaming maybe? There‚Äôs also specific marriage subreddits that could be helpful for advice too.  r/marriage and r/marriageadvice could be a good start.
10plpdt,j6lmzsr,,This is a lot of unfortunate events to happen - I am really sorry to hear you are going through all of this. It is hard to think clearly and objectively when you are in the middle of so much aggravation. The fact that you and your husband do not agree on a way forward is a further complication.  Here are the issues, I think, as you laid out: 1) you are living in a very small house with people you do not get along with. The house is so small you and your husband cannot sleep in the same place. Your husband does not want to leave this house, while you feel like you need to have your own space. To put it mildly, the two of you are not on the same page on this.  2) money issues are rampant. You are currently trying to save money to be able to move out. Your husband gives his money to his parents, which happened without him telling you. Again, the two of you are on separate sides of the issue.  You did own a house for a while but decided to sell it and essentially lost the stake you had in it, bringing your savings back to zero. This was a mistake on both your parts. We all make them. But hopefully you will learn something from that and be wiser in the future.  3) your stuff in a storage unit is another issue, though one easily remedied. If you want to retrieve your clothes or other items you could do that yourself whether your husband wants you to or not. Bring some of your family members (father, etc) and I am sure they will help you.   Honestly I think you should move out. You don't necessarily have to divorce your husband if you don't want to. Plenty of couples live apart for a time - think of military families, for example. Move out, retrieve your stuff, keep your finances separate from your husband, and let him figure his stuff out on his own. Either he will grow up and stand up for his family or he will stay tied to his parents. He may feel like he owes them or guilty for all of the problems at their house, but at the end of the day he has to make a choice.  Part of your distress right now is that you are uncertain as to what you should do. Making up your mind as to a way forward will bring you some peace.
10plpdt,j6lwoil,,Last time you posted about your situation, you mentioned that you had several job offers in other states. Not sure why you didn't take one of those, but are any of them still open? If you have your own bank account now, you should be able to save enough to move to another state.
10plpdt,,j6mz0fs,Yes. But I don‚Äôt want to move to another state. That‚Äôs the whole reasoning behind my post.
10plpdt,,j6n6bae,I understand that you want to stay near family, but you also say you can't afford to. You're going to have to make a choice. And frankly, you don't need advice from the people on this forum. You're not homeless; you don't like your living situation. You need a marriage counselor.
10plpdt,j7ypgjd,,You take what you can get , life sucks and sometimes you have to do stuff you don‚Äôt like to get ahead, if you can‚Äôt afford to live where you are now you need to move ASAP to better your situation, you can‚Äôt rely on family or anything to help , if y i I really want to improve your life you have to do it yourself and sounds like you have a bad husband , if I was were you I would leave him , he‚Äôs holding you down and manipulating you.
10plpdt,j6mz0yq,,Support your husband if he loves you. Be humble and listen to mother in law Opinion. Maybe your in a place to gain strength, willpower. Keep your family together with love :)
10plpdt,j6salku,,Your husband is manipulative and controlling. Letting Your kids go without their stuff and clothing because he want's to live a certain place is abusive. He does not care about you or the children being miserable as long as he think he has leverage over you. Really..? Is this the kind of man you want setting an example for your children? He gives a s**t about his mother being cruel to you as long as you are under his thumb and control. Yeah... he sounds like a keeper... not!!
10pl64i,j6l7upf,,Google: homeless resources PDF county, state You need to know where the soup kitchens are located, free food pantries, shelters, SNAP/food stamp office, WIC, free health clinics, unemployment office, temporary employment agencies, free bicycles, blood donor sites, can and bottle recycling points, free car repair, free haircuts, monthly bus/train pass.  Collect your documents: passport, birth certificate, state ID, driver‚Äôs license, union cards, food handler‚Äôs permit, insurance, diplomas   Find a temporary place to stay and get employed as quickly as possible.
10pl64i,,j6lijlz,I'm unable to work and am kind of old but everything else you mentioned sounds like a good place to start (thank you!). Any state/city you would recommend going to for at least decent resources/homeless care and services?.
10pl64i,,j6msrwy,NYC, literally, day you land in Manhattan, go to   12 W 14th St 4th fl, New York, NY 10011  Waverly Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - NYC HRA Department of Social Services  You'll get food stamps, public assistance cash that you can withdraw from an atm, and whatever state healthcare they have, then after that, get into a shelter, work till you drop, get with section 8 and call every week till you get your voucher.   you're welcome
10pl64i,,j6lm7bn,You're going to find that places will only help you with housing assistance if you've been a resident of the county for at least a year. That means you need to find a shelter to list as your address, get a new ID, and wait a year (if it ever opens up).  Basically, keeps the poor prisoner to their county. Although, if your county doesn't do anything to help the homeless, it's worth a shot.
10pl64i,,j6pv5vl,i might be in this situation soon
10pl64i,j6lecue,,Took it head on because it was my own fault (addiction), spent some time with the head spinning then pulled myself the fuck together and fought hard to move ahead. Anything's possible.
10pl64i,,j6lhwwf,Yeah, funny thing is that when I was in my late teens/early twenties I was very much at home living out on the streets/vagabonding and loved just about every minute of it.  Now, I'm pushing 60, have health problems and am way out of shape and the thought/prospect of being homeless terrifies me.  Strange what a difference an extra 40 years makes )-:
10pl64i,,j6lsl1v,It's a very free but rough lifestyle. I'm about to turn 49 and I couldn't go through it again. I did notice that Vagabond is a pretty "hip" thing these days. I wonder if they'll learn
10pl64i,,j6rqda6,I turn 60 in June and I'm also in poor health. I wouldn't last long without proper housing and the thought scares me a lot.
10pl64i,j6mseu7,,Step 1: limit amount of personal items/ get storage so your not carrying a lot of items Step 2: look up resources for homeless within 10 miles of yourself Step 3: contact everyone you possibly can for shelter using those resources  Step 4:  Apply for government assistance  Step 5: work your way out of the hole slowly and take your time to break the cycle

10pl64i,j6myszj,,I saw it coming from years away.   Bought the pieces of gear I was missing.   When it came, so did the bad weather.   Staying at the shelter until the weather breaks.
10pl64i,j6n8jg4,,Thankfully I had some supplies I could use already. But main thing was making sure I had a vehicle I could sleep in. Meaning working heat and room to hold stuff/lay down. For me its a minivan. I've got some thick foam mattress pads, a sleeping bag, and some blankets I use for a bed.   I have a cheap car plug in pot that will warm water (it's not strong enough to boil but it was only about $40). Ramen and some cheaper frozen pre-cooked meats (chicken nuggets aren't bad price per ounce) heat up fairly well. I'm in a cold climate so I don't have to get ice for my cooler as often either. And I do the gallon water refill at walmart every few days.   I have a gym membership which let's me shower, and I bounce between a few truck stops for overnight parking and bathroom access.   I've only been homeless a bit over a week but I had less than 2 weeks to prepare. Thankfully I had some help getting started but all the shelters in my area are full and housing assistance has been backed up for years (this was a problem even pre-covid in most area). Also I was out of work at the time too. Thankful to be starting a job today acrually.  My biggest concerns are staying warm and hydrated. My biggest fears are not having money for gas (heat and electric) and being sent away from the truck stops. I just limit my usage as much as possible.  My suggestions if you have the ability would be to invest in privacy/insulation for windows on your vehicle and finding a cooking pot that can boil water.
10pl64i,j6yf2jz,,I went to a shelter, used the last of my money to wash and dry my clothes, prepay my phone bill and requested a 3 month supply of my meds, transitioned from a shelter to a transitional living/halfway house and am waiting on my voucher for an apartment. I got a job ASAP as well

10pjra0,j6la418,,A nice TV and OTA antenna and a futon couch and you're set.   I used to sleep in my "living room" when I had, what I consider to be, a deluxe 1br "studio". I used the quotation marks because the kitchen, dining room and bathroom were practically in the same room while the "living room/bedroom" was behind it, it was nice and bougie but the dimensions were almost as small as a tiny home.   I know you'll overcome these fears.   Walmart & Fingerhut have cheap cots, beds and futons for sale.
10pjra0,j6lvnbl,,I live in a big house that has 7 apartments. Mines is one big room, and I mean BIG..and a separate bathroom, which is bigger than the room alone I had in NYC.  I was in a shelter and the landlord said I can move in any time I wanted, so I did..with nothing. I got about 7 thick blankets from the shelter and slept on the floor the first night. That night.. heartburn from nowhere, and I saw a ghost, well heard it. He was twirling my thermos around that was on top of the frig. Woke up in so much pain, but it was okay.  I was afraid too. So afraid that if I went to the store or something, I would come back and find the locks changed. Took me a while to get over that. And then there is the people who didn't get help yet, the looks. I didn't know what to say, so I said nothing.  Then there's sleeping in a place by myself. I'm not use to it being this damn dark outside and so quiet. I barely make any sounds when I'm home which is all the time. But I just got use to playing music a little louder. It's taking me some time to get use to living by myself.  I don't think I'll ever get use to it though.
10pjra0,j6ld18o,,Just take it one day at a time and be kind to yourself! You‚Äôll do great
10pjra0,j6ltx47,,The fear never goes away. That's not a bad thing. Embrace it. Savor every meal you eat, take an extra minute in the shower to enjoy the hot water. I think for people who haven't experienced want, they take it for granted. You will be able to find a happiness most people never experience, to be able to appreciate the little things knowing what it was like without them.   March 25th. That's your new birthday, that's the day you get a new life. Of course there will always be something to worry. The rich have worries too. But you will have something they cannot buy. You will have a genuine appreciation for your place and everything it comes with. Take it all in, enjoy it, and know that your concern is because of how much you love your new life. It is a gift to be able to be so happy you're afraid to lose it.
10pjra0,j6nhus0,,Homeostasis is a set of human states where both the body and the mind begin the healing process.  It will not begin in full until you are removed from the perturbations that cause you stress. The stresses caused by homelessness keep your body and mind in the state called fight-or-flight, which doesn't allow for the type of healing that occurs within true homeostatic states.  This is why it is imperative to establish your new home as _safe space_. Safe space can become healing space if we keep it safe. After that, if it becomes healing space, the potential is there for it to become _sacred space_.  Sacred space is where we thrive. Survival is a victory, but a human life can do far more than simply "win". A human has the potential to heal and heal other people.   But you can't get there if you betray the space, and what that space can be. You must establish healthy boundaries with others so that your apartment can possess that power in your life. You must not trust others to stay with you if they don't have the same goal in mind for your apartment.   You have to believe in your ability to heal by yourself. You have to become a whole person by yourself first. You cannot help other people heal until you get there, and you can't get there when you dread your own home.  Loneliness betrays us before people do. Trust is built over a long period of time. A home gives us the luxury of time, because we can lock the door. So, until someone proves that they are worthy to step foot into your home, don't let them.   Instead, make your home into a place that is a refuge from betrayal.
10pjra0,j6nsubf,,Switch your thoughts to gratitude. It worked for me. And maybe you will be homeless again. It's not time to think about that. What color are you going to paint the place? Who's the first friend you want to see your new digs? What's the first meal you're going to make when you're situated? That's the kind of questions you should be asking yourself. Also CONGRATULATIONS MY FRIEND! I'M PROUD OF YOU.
10pjra0,j6lrd0l,,I live in my car and I know how you feel. There is a place I can get right now if I wanted but I'm afraid. I had a similar case where I had to leave situation after situation that living in my car feels like my own place to be safe and free. I'm to worried to leave my car alone too long also. I guess the best part about having your own place is shower, laundry and a quiet peaceful place. Use that to your advantage and develop good habits. You will get good sleep and be clean and comfortable. I worry to much about owning furniture too beacuse I don't want to spend money on it if I'm just going to have to abandon it. If you do need furniture I would recommend goodwill or arc. They have lots of stuff that's usually cheep. And another good tip, if your going to be in a place buy everything you need at dollar tree to get started. I feel like being able to save money might help with the anxiety a lot.
10pjra0,j6ls2g9,,so if looking for advice: you stated you became homeless d/t getting an apartment with people who couldnt pay rent and was dirty. Guess what? it stops now ! i wouldnt bring ANYONE in  there with me, work as much as you can to to save and pay the rent.   The past should have taught you a lesson, consider this new apartment a blessing and keep it moving!God bless you!

10pjra0,,j6py0r0,Oh boy, that brought back some memories of my first apartment back into "normal" life. I had a folding chair and a TV tray that I would eat all my meals and use as my desk. I eventually saved and upgraded to a folding table.   Friend from work was dropping me off and came in to use my bathroom. The look he gave me. I didn't know this but he told everyone at work and these fuckers show up one night with furniture from their garages, or spare bedrooms. A small comfy couch, a table with two chairs, and this little portable dvd player with a stack of DVDs that they let me borrow (didnt have a tv) and I learned that I could check out DVDs from the library. My supervisors wife gave me a bottle of shampoo because she heard I was using a bar of soap for everything. At first I was embarrassed as hell, but these guys, they made me feel real lucky. I worked there for another three years but still keep in touch with a few of those fellas.
10pjra0,,j6lr4b7,What kind of car?
10pjra0,,j6lt1yx,Toyota Prius. I bought it brand new. Rent was getting too high and I had been thinking about living out of a car for awhile. There was this guy called Inspirational Nomad on YT and he lived out of his car so I finally went for it.
10pjra0,,j6nbe5x,I lived out of mine (Chrysler 300s) for a short period. Live in Florida and it was miserably hot lol.  Thanks for the reply! I love your seemingly very positive attitude. Hope all is well with you.
10pjra0,j6lpxex,,Well, depends how your housing is going to be and what mitigations you put in place. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a repeat.  Also, congratulations. Very happy for you ü•≥
10pjra0,j6o0gt7,,Best of luck to you!! Try not to dwell on the things you cannot control. You need to budget very carefully...make sure you remain employed and have a side gig as  back up if necessary. Dont move anyone in with you who may have contributed to your homlessness. If you get a roommate make sure they have a job and steady income and not on drugs. Make it month to month so you can get rid of  them easily if they become a bum.   Stop or cut way back on expensive habits.....post on local facebook groups or nextdoor for cheap or free furniture.....lots of luck to you.
10pjra0,j6p1fgv,,The fear and paranoia will never really leave you, in my experience.  Once you've been there, you see how powerless you really are and how rigged society is.  I've got 2 acres and want to put a yurt on it, but until the day I die, I'll always remember having to sleep in parking lots and the way other people treat you.  Like, worse than trash.   People say they like underdogs, but in my experience they just *say* that and tend to bully the shit out of them IRL.
10pjra0,j6q7tdl,,Can‚Äôt go through life scared.
10pikex,j6ku6qz,,Are you on the lease or have you been paying rent? Legally if you're getting mail there you also have a claim. If any of these are true they need to evict you first before you can be given the boot. You might be able to speak to someone in the system where you live to ask for resources. Call 211 and look online for resources in your area. Ousting someone with an 8yo child is something that shouldn't be allowed IMO. Hell I don't care if it's  a newborn, as long as the child is legally not an adult and in school or unable to take care of itself a person shouldn't loose their housing.
10pikex,j6l95tt,,You can try asking for advice at r/assistance as well.  There's r/roomandboard but you probably don't want to leave the area if you have a job.  Can you clarify - are you looking for housing resources for you only or for you AND your child?  If you can prove you have a job, are you able to stay in your current residence?  I saw in the comments that you're in Chicago, do they have 211 and 211.com ?
10pikex,,j6lfeg6,They do but it‚Äôs a long process
10pikex,j6lqqax,,Definitely start calling the women shelters tomorrow if you have not already.  Also call the Salvation Army in Chicago to see if they can help you.
10pikex,,j6lsvis,They‚Äôre not letting a man in the womens shelter lol
10pikex,,j6lswkd,But I will check with Salvation Army
10pikex,,j6n4drd,Good luck!
10pikex,j6kpx1g,,Where do you live? If you can travel you both can stay with me. But there isn‚Äôt much work here.  Women‚Äôs shelters usually take women and children and men and the elderly suffer. I‚Äôve been trying to find someone to help out but it‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôd look into a shelter first maybe if possible.

10pikex,j79cbx8,,Update on my situation for anybody who may still be following this.   Me and my daughter were placed in transitional housing and I now have an opportunity to save my money and get the things we need. To the person who suggested the Salvation Army bless your heart because they put us in great place. Yeah I have to share the apartment but at least I don‚Äôt have to wander the streets until 7pm and I have a kitchen to cook my own meals. Free Wifi to boot üòÄ
10pez7r,j6lwv2u,,It‚Äôs delicious and vegetarian. They are very clean. I lived next door to the temple in Arizona for many years and let me do chores in exchange for meals. They are nice people.
10pez7r,,j6lxlf0,I agree. I missed those food and nice people :)
10pemtv,j6kec9v,,Sikh temples do this in India and abroad whereever they are. Their religion believes that it should provide this as charity to anyone who wants regardless of faith or status. But again this is private religion, not government.  In the US, Christian churches do it a lot but usually as part of missionary work rather than charity. So it is usually involves religious service or proselyzation of some sort.
10pemtv,,j6mmryt,Right you are.

10pemtv,j6mh2sz,,people who are hungry or desperate are easier to manipulate. That's why.
10pemtv,,j6mljo8,Why you would say so? Those have been run for generations for public good.   Now, I would like to think objectively, what would they get in return other then humility?   bring it on..  It is western materialist notion that you can live happily only through plunder and depredation.  Not only that, their are business of hundreds of billions of dollar the sole purpose is NOT to extract profit rather betterment of the community while doing businesses to serve.
10pemtv,,j6pqjvw,>I don't know why US does not have something like this.  I was attempting to provide an answer as to why.  >Not only that, their are business of hundreds of billions of dollar the sole purpose is NOT to extract profit rather betterment of the community while doing businesses to serve.  Most of the "non-Profit" businesses in America are some kind of scam, or at the very least, they only exist so rich people can avoid paying taxes and up their public relations.  Real Altruism doesn't exist in the market.
10pemtv,,j6shc6a,>I was attempting to provide an answer as to why.  Waiting
10pemtv,,j6tmzoo,Do I have to spell it out?  Because we live in a world where and when Money is more important than human life. Why spend a dollar feeding a homeless person when you can exploit them for a lot more Money?   I don't like it either.
10pemtv,,j6mvqpi,Wash your brain.

10pc47s,j6kzfwt,,I was a job corps residential advisor for about six months after I retired.   I think it is great resource for young people who are looking for a trade.     It may vary by location, but the one I worked at was very strict towards the students. 10 pm lights off and strict quiet time on weekdays and midnight on weekends.   I can‚Äôt remember the time, but it was a very early wake up with mandatory room clean up and common area assigned cleanup assignments which were inspected every morning by staff.  Time off the facility is restricted at first but eventually you will be able to go off the facility on weekends if you have a place to stay.   Any drinking or positive UAs gets a student removed.  I brought that up because I feel some are set up for failure because the recruiters don‚Äôt mention that and a lot of student get sent home, whether they have a home or not.   So if anyone feels they can‚Äôt abide by rules, which in someways were  stricter than when I was in the marines, don‚Äôt bother going.  That being said, all student who don‚Äôt have a high school diploma or GED will get that knocked out first.   Each job corps location offers multiple trades to train in and there may be a wait for the trade you selected.   While you wait they may put you in another trade with room.  Admin assistant was the trade most of the people went through while waiting.  My location had heavy equipment operation, heavy equipment repair, CDL, electrician, general construction, some medical programs where the student went to the nearby community college, and possibly carpentry and plumbing.  They do help student find a job.  I met several students who were homeless and they all seemed to do well.  The older students all seemed to do well also.   The sixteen and seventeen year olds seemed to have the least success in my opinion and caused a lot of problems for the other students because of the military like group punishment.     They should have had a separate dorm for them.   I would recommend attending.    Several students I personally new ended up making over a $100,000 a year once they had just a little work experience in the field.   Welding and heavy equipment student did really well working the pipelines.   A lot of electrician students ended up as union apprentices, and the CDL students over 21 all had jobs waiting on them when they graduated.
10pc47s,j6w9qa0,,If anyone has questions, I went through there for the course Max but didn't go to the advance training. AMA
10oy2co,j6htl6h,,Are there any local agencies that will help you bridge the gap? It sounds as if things will be looking up very soon.  I‚Äôm not familiar with your area, but generally the Salvation Army and other such organizations receive a great deal of federal money as well as money from utility companies to assist those behind on their bills. The caveat is that they may require a disconnection notice first.   If you don‚Äôt want t to go that route, you can probably call or set up a payment plan online that will postpone your payment or break up any past due amount into payments spread over the next 3-6 months.  As for rent, same deal. As a single person, it‚Äôs harder to get assistance if any kind, but call your local social services office and google ‚Äúrent assistance‚Äù plus your zip code to try to find resources. Don‚Äôt give up!  As for getting your mental health on track, if you don‚Äôt have a doctor or insurance, contact your city‚Äôs community services board for a list of free or sliding-scale treatment options.  If you are really feeling hopeless, call or text 988. It‚Äôs a confidential mental health crisis line and just having someone to talk things through with might go a long way toward making you feel like you can start to get a handle on this.   If you haven‚Äôt been eating well, please update with your zip code. I‚Äôm sure there are food pantries and other resources to help get you through the next few weeks and people will be more than happy to help.  Again, it sounds like you have a lot to look forward to. Don‚Äôt let depression lie to you and convince you there‚Äôs no way out except homelessness. As you well know, that‚Äôs trading a temporary set of problems for a crisis that can be extremely difficult to come back from.   ***mom hug***
10oy2co,,j6j4vor,We're too far behind on the bills to catch up. My roomates just had their second kid and are deciding to move back in with their parents, and my name isn't on the lease so I'm pretty sure this ship is sinking.  As per my job, I've been working on/off trying to find what sticks, but I've always managed to pay my bills. I just got laid off because of Covid so I am in between work right now.  I'm going to call the Salvation Army and see if they have work available. Keeping a job is difficult because I don't have a car, and there is a lack of public transit available.  I was really hoping to find a construction crew that could pick me up for work or something. At this point I am losing hope that I will be able to find any stability before I am starting from ground up all over again.
10oy2co,,j6jfhse,There should be lots of day labor gigs even some Wendy‚Äôs pay daily. It shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to find a job. Post locally on Facebook for help. See if anybody will hire you. I hope things get better. If you are not on the lease, I would stay in that place and write it out for as long as possible.  Look into donating plasma as well
10oy2co,j6hqgzv,,Are you working?
10oy2co,,j6hr82h,Start a new job on the 10th next month.
10ov4i4,j6h0s9q,,Negatively.
10ov4i4,j6h90cl,,why are you looking for homeless people all over Canada to send to Las Vegas? I just looked at your posts. Are you a human trafficker or a serial killer?
10ov4i4,,j6ksop0,Just a fuckwit spammer I guess
10ov4i4,,j6nuang,yeah give em words about words.
10ov4i4,,j6hy2a5,Noooo lol. People from Canada support our program to feed the hungry and homeless, and they can potentially win a VIP trip for 2 to Vegas
10ov4i4,,j6hz86f,Not sounding right. If people wanted to help they wouldn't need to be bought with trips to another country.
10ov4i4,,j6nuryf,yo, vegas aint safe. pple are here for community and data not really proving stuff, showing off or being cool. its just regular pple talking about today. millions of homeless pple on earth. its just a situation to contend with. i recommend vortex success and minds in unison at yoututbe. those are places ive been at for few years now. like faith and coping skills it helps.   everyone needs housing is a understatement. mental health? does it matter? just make it to tomorrow.
10ov4i4,j6h9izd,,Consider [Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs)  The base layer **Physiological** needs include many things that can be difficult for homeless people to attain:  Heat, clothes, hygiene, food, shelter, and sleep to name a few.  The second tier is **Safety**. Basically everything in this tier is difficult for homeless folks to maintain:  Health, personal security, emotional security, financial security.  Third tier is **Love and Social Belonging**, and in most cultures homeless fall into their situation thru the lack of social safety net, and our culture actively ostracizes and shuns them.  Family, friends, intimacy, trust, acceptance, and giving and receiving love and affection.  **Esteem** is the fourth tier, and includes both self esteem and the esteem of others - how much you are respected as an individual. Also a difficult thing for homeless people to acquire.  The tiers above involve these four are about mental enrichment and (surprise surprise) are also going to be difficult for homeless to achieve.  But the idea of the hierarchy is that you need to build from each tier, and that someone who can‚Äôt reliably acquire food won‚Äôt have the ability to really prioritize their safety. Someone who feels unsafe won‚Äôt be able to find stable love and social bonds. A person who can‚Äôt form love or social bonds won‚Äôt be able to cultivate esteem.  So on and so forth.  Basically homeless people are fucked when it comes to achieving happiness. Every disadvantage is weighing them down, and it is a failure of our society and our ability to empathize that we continue to allow it to happen. People who can survive being homeless have suffered extreme mental distress, and have tested the bounds of what humans can endure.  For me personally the third and fourth tiers were the stumbling block, and even though I had the privilege of the first two tiers being OK, I wasn‚Äôt able to resolve the third and fourth until I was no longer homeless.
10ov4i4,,j6nux38,awards to that. i had something similar but lost the draft.
10ov4i4,j6h51hg,,Well for starters not having a safe comfortable stable place to sleep will affect your sleep and you may start to hallucinate. Also, this may be the case if you can‚Äôt find food as well other people in society treat you a certain way, and soon you may start to believe it and doubt yourself being exposed to the elements constantly will affect your physical health, which will intern affect your mental health.
10ov4i4,j6ss88m,,What are my thoughts...  Two+ year old profile, no content older than two weeks at this point, no Karma to speak of.  Is participating in a Karma farming sub.  And the initial activity on the profile, is a bunch of comments made to TWO YEAR OLD comments, necro-ing a few conversations essentially. (To Necro, as in, to raise a dead thread).  The order of things can be important.  First... some light necro activity.  Then, the post about the Giveaway.  Then, a few other posts apparently disguised as promotion for this giveaway that were subsequently removed (presumably by the mods of those subs).  Then, some Karma farming.  Then your first post here, written as if you were writing some kind of article and farming this sub for content... or have an ulterior motive.  Then... more removed promotions for your Giveaway.  Then your second post here written in that same manner, as if you were looking to use the comments for something else, like an excuse to pursue your agenda.  Then, another promotion for your Giveaway removed.  Then this latest post, once again, written like you have an agenda OTHER than just talking about the topic you bring up... and once again you find a reason to bring up your organization and the Giveaway.  ... I'm sensing a pattern.  Something about... promoting a Giveaway.  Call me crazy.  I mean... I am.  Everyone knows it.  This doesn't affect how my observations are on point here, however.  You are far more transparent than you apparently want to admit to, based on the content of some of your comments... **and by that, I mean that your goal here is to get the word out about your organization, and get people to donate money to it**... and you know you can't admit that in subs like this one... since we'd just boot you.  It violates two of our rules.  This makes any attempts at being genuine on your part ring hollow, because most everyone can \*SEE\* that you aren't interested in the comments past finding an opportunity to pursue your goal and promote your agenda.  Why don't I just remove all the content and ban you then?  Well... for a few reasons.  One... there is still value in a good, public flogging.  Two... I'm only a junior Mod.. a probie... a newbie to the position and I can't ban yet.  I can still remove the content though, and I likely will.  I' going to give you a chance though.  Here's how it works.  Reactions can be predictable.  How you react to this comment, for example, can be predicted.  Based on how you've commented previously, you could get aggressive in your response, while deflecting and redirecting attention away from what I've brought up for you to comment on.  You could use phrasing like "ridiculous allegations".  You could flat-out ignore what I've brought up, and only focus on a SINGLE point to refute... and it would be such a mundane and irrelevant correction on your part as to clearly be a desperate attempt to make me appear to be wrong about \*something\*.  You could attempt to DM me, and move this conversation out of the public eye.  Or you could refuse to respond altogether.  You could even run... deleting all your content yourself and bugging out to another account.  At any rate, here's your chance to speak up for yourself, and the pattern of actions you have laid out behind you that put you into the hotseat.  You want to stay, talk about homelessness, and try to HELP the people here instead of treating them like the pool you need to advertise to?  Here's your chance to explain and be honest.  Otherwise... I'm just going to pull your posts in the sub, and have another Mod ban you.
10ov4i4,,j6vn4tz,I appreciate you taking the time to bring your concerns to my attention. I am ONLY here to participate in discussions and share information about homelessness, which is a cause that is important to me. I understand that my previous posts may have come across as promoting a giveaway (that directly supports the cause I care about), and I apologize if I have violated the rules of the subreddit in any way.  My intention has always been to contribute to the community and hopefully provide valuable information and insights. I understand the importance of following the rules of the subreddit, and I will be more mindful of my posts in the future.  Thank you for the opportunity to address your concerns, and I hope to continue participating in the discussions in a productive and respectful manner.
10ov4i4,,j6xqaam,>I am ONLY here to participate in discussions and share information about homelessness  Can you do so, without EVER promoting your organization or this donation/giveaway?  I don't think so.... because up until now, you have been finding excuses to promote.  And even with your choice of username, it appears as if your main goal here on Reddit is to promote your agenda.  You having this account on Reddit to promote, in and of itself, is not a bad thing.  Misrepresenting yourself to maintain access to what you \*think\* your target market is.... that **is** a bad thing, though.  When you try to legitimize your account by farming Karma, so as to open up your access to be able to promote in more subs (that may have minimum Karma requirements), and you make posts HERE that appear to be more geared toward earning you Karma and giving you an opportunity to promote, than actually having a discussion... your desire to contribute to the community comes into question.  The questions you asked here... what difference did a single meal make, how does homelessness affect mental health, are you concerned about the rise in homelessness... all those questions were geared toward redirecting attention to what YOUR organization is doing.  Your post about whether or not people are concerned over the rise in Homelessness, and how people should do \*something\*... that is just a set up for you chiming in with how \*YOU\* have one solution, where people can chip in to make a difference.  I've seen you Necro comments... only two weeks ago.  So, you obviously have the ability to go through older posts and comments here.  There are regularly posts regarding mental health and homelessness.  When you have a HISTORY of responding to old comments, why would you think you should start ANOTHER discussion about mental health, instead of contributing to one of the existing discussions about mental health and homelessness?  And asking what difference a single meal makes... that's an obvious correlation to what you are promoting.    Unfortunately, your justifications as to the specifics of what your organization does are thin/flimsy.  You say $25 feeds one person.  I say it feeds multiple people, **with** today's inflation.  I say when you graph the numbers, the curve goes up for the number of people you feed per dollar as the dollar amount increases.... or the graph goes down on the cost per individual fed, as you put more money into food.  It is the basis for how any food service industry works.    You say you sell four people on donating and that will provide four homeless people with a meal each.  I say if you collect $100 toward feeding the homeless, you can and should feed more than **four** people.  If you can't feed more than four or five people on $100, your model for feeding the homeless is flawed, or geared toward putting far too much money into the "miscellaneous expenses" fund.  If \*I\* can pick apart what little I know about your model, and show you how it fails to accomplish the core goal... which is feeding the homeless... then the legitimacy of your model is definitely in question.  I know the homelessness problem in Canada isn't as bad as in the USA.... we've got between 550,000 and 750,000 homeless (close to 200k in NYC alone).  But "feeding the homeless" means feeding as many as possible, not one at a time, one meal at a time... and not at that price.  I'm obviously not the only person to read what you've presented so far and think "Scam?".  Can you \*really\* agree to put all of that away when you post here, so that no one points the finger at you and cries "Scammer!"?    Again... your history up until now says that you cannot.

I go to work everyday and talk about my fake home life with my coworkers and then go sleep in the parking lot,in my experience homelessness makes you trust nobody everyone thinks it couldn‚Äôt happen to them and holds you at some level of responsibility for being homeless and they look down on it..like what did you do to get there??
10ov4i4,,j6np73g,I know homelessness is criminalized. I explain to some when i feel like telling or when i have to i simply can't work and can't afford to pay criminally insane rent. I can't buy land and build a home. Being mistreated like invisible sub-human is not new to me so i had to cut contact with all. One wealthy former neighbor stopped talking to me after i told her i'm in my car. Unlike her, i was never a careerist money grabber. Such individuals never know what it's like to be poor, disabled, homeless. Same individuals don't give others time of day and snow in winter while they had no trouble asking me for help and favors. Long before i became homeless i realized i can't trust anyone and had to cut contact with all.

I finally won my case and I am still waiting for payment, tags are expired now, no insurance, the only assistance I have is food stamps, almost out of gas and desperate. Now let's talk about the low life drug addicts expect to come to me for shelter and food when I say no I get sucker punched. Every homeless assistance program for some reason isn't available to me except locked in shelters with bunk beds stacked 3 feet apart otherwise I stay in my car, only shower In hot weather because I can't get to places I can get Free showers.

Have to keep looking for things/experiences/thoughts  that make you happy. Have an arsenal of life hacks like most of us do to keep going. I have felt like dying a lot.

10ov4i4,j6nxjac,,dear give 2 win, pple here make it to the next day. if this is a grift you arrived at the right bankbot. i can take you to a reddit about grifts where im a bankbot and write comedy all day long to make the time pass.  back to the topic.  so the H situation or housing situation is H. H plus effort, time, applications and self regulation are all at risk in any trauma. pple here are sober living types not into drugs, not into the party life and not into suggestible easy answers. pple here andmyself seek our own housing of our own finding. accepting help around these parts is not the issue. pple here are very proud and restrained about seeking help. self reliance is a constant theme here, is all. I would have appreciated it if you added the vegas offer to your post. its not transparent of a post to have added it inthe comments. please respect how much pple are trying.   homeless-bot.  read the affirmations then listen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO2s9BR-HWc&t=327s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO2s9BR-HWc&t=327s) thats where pple are today. NLP. meditation. trying to stay well.
10ov4i4,j6oqm3m,,You'll find a lot of people start talking to themselves. When their mind crosses something uncomfortable (like the way they were being treated) they'll say it out loud.  I like it to the mind and the heart are at odds, so they'll argue until they agree.
10ov4i4,j79t08u,,OP‚Äôs posting here gives off plenty of scummy vibes as already discussed in the comments‚Ä¶that were extremely thorough with some solid sound logic.  I learned a few things I hadn‚Äôt known from these comments, which helped make up for the let down handed out by OP here in being a disappointment.  Really thankful to those who chimed in to inform those like myself, who are still yet learning that there are, unfortunately dubious situations to be on the lookout for here on subreddits.
10ot66d,j6hayn8,,It depends. I had one friend who was badly burned rescuing his dog from a fire, he had to have skin grafts etc. In his condition a person would normally get discharged and sent home after a few days but because of the risk of infection he had to stay in the burn ward at the hospital for several weeks. Infection is the main thing they worry about.
10ot66d,j6j8t4m,,I worked in a dozen nursing homes. Almost every single one of them had a few younger people in their thirties forties and fifties that just had really bad injuries Or diseases, and nobody to take care of them.  The hospital will send you to an old people nursing home.The bad part of this, is that you are locked in the building 24 hours and cannot leave. The other bad part is that the whole building smells like piss.   Also the food is horrible and they are almost all badly under staff. So if you s*** yourself grandma you'll be sitting in your own pile of s*** for a few hours Every time.     only way to avoid this horrible situation  It's to settle down and build yourself a social circle. And some savings.
10ot66d,j6grwcf,,Well rn I need surgery after being in a wreck that broke my lumbar spine in 4 places and fractured my c1 which holds ur spine to skull... Will have to be placed in a halo so I've had to postpone my surgery until I have stable housing... This wreck is what led to my eviction and ultimately being homeless...
10ot66d,,j6gsdl5,Man, thats just sad )-: . I'm sorry that you got evicted over it and even more sorry that you aren't even able to have surgery until your housed. The system is really broken. Are you able to at least get minimum care?. Pain relief, antibiotics, a clinic you can go to help manage your issues?.
10ot66d,,j6json6,Why haven't you sued?
10ot66d,,j6kxs6b,I have... But those lawsuits take time.
10ot66d,,j6l3k2r,I actually have 2 pending lawsuits... One against the lady that hit me and one against the emt service that transported me and my ex to the hospital... He was immediately placed on a board and in a neck brace and loaded on the ambulance... I was basically pulled fromy van and had to sit up otw to the hospital... He only had minor bruises... My back was broke in 4 places .. my neck fractured and I was 5 months pregnant and miscarried the next morning... I walked from my van to the ambulance like this.. smh
10ot66d,j6hlyby,,I know of a couple of people who have been repeatedly turned away for not having a stable place to recover. It's heartbreaking.
10ot66d,j6ivi7h,,I know a homeless man rn in a rehab place after being hit by a car
10ot66d,j6gsvaj,,Yes love... The wreck was right when COVID hit and Chapiil Hill the hospital that I was referred to for this elect surgery was only taking life threatening referrals and chronic pain isn't considered that... Of course I had to quit work andy landlord evicted be6i was $209 short on rent... Smh... america the great
10ot66d,j6jsiwq,,So I know here in California they have rehab facilities that are wound and care-type places to recover and they have social workers to help you get services while you are in their care.
10osy2q,j6jilv9,,I think the police will take you to a domestic abuse shelter. Also this is a listing of many types of resources findhelp.org
10osy2q,,j6jsrcw,What do you mean by that? Are you suggesting OP heads to the police station to ask for assistance?
10osy2q,,j6juqgl,I asked police in one town to take me to a domestic abuse shelter and they did. I can't speak to all cities and towns obviously but they might where she is.
10orx4r,j6ioq1l,,I've found trust to be hard to come by in this environment. I'm in a position where a betrayal of trust could result in my death. I can't afford to risk it under the circumstances.
10orx4r,j6i8fv5,,Back when I was homeless and traveling (things were A LOT different as the other homeless/travelers USED to keep an eye out for each other)& I made a ton of amazing friends/ travelling buddies on the Rd. I still keep in contact with some 20+ yrs later.  But that was all 10-15+ yrs ago. With how society has gone,and how messed up people are,just be careful and keep your wits about you. You Can make some great friends and have a nice community, or u could run into assholes that will kill you for your nice gear. It's hard but can be done. There's still good people out there. Sometimes you just have to wade through a pile of shit before you find them. Just be smart about it,people can be AMAZINGLY GREAT ACTORS,to get what they want from you. When we'd feel comfortable with another "crew" or travelling couple,we'd usually end up "crewing up" and riding frieght together in larger numbers and sharing our "wares" with each other (which needed to be done at certain hopouts in ghetto areas of many major cities). Good luck! Hope you find some awesome people!
10orx4r,j6ig2p2,,I would just recommend never putting too much faith into a person...
10orx4r,j6hhhm8,,Absolutely yes. I met my 2 best mates on the street and we've had each others backs through thick and thin, laughter and tears etc. I consider myself lucky to have met them.
10orx4r,j6iisn9,,No this is not possible whether you are homeless or not.  Evolution based emotions like love and friendship specifically on resources. So no matter how many fairy tales you read, at the end of the day, people are out for themselves though often even they themselves dont realize it.
10orx4r,j6jfbuo,,Humans are transactional by default, not mutual. Close friendships come from ensconced communities with rigid social mores. Outside of family, friendships are quite literally a form of Stockholm syndrome as people traverse the reality of their own encaged domestication with performative roles resulting in rewards or punishment in a closed system. Homelessness, vagabondism in individuals is literally a defaulting to our species origins of migration and survival.   The closest friends I ever made were short term, and we departed company as we achieved our goals. If we stayed together for any length of time we would have likely left on bad terms.  Just as default humans are not monogamous, something that not even religion can cure, we're also not hardwired for permanent surrogate family once we become grown ass adults. Civilization demands our productivity, and in return, it enables us to remain mental children from cradle to grave. Hence this society's mass pop culture of Superhero movies, adult toys, celebrity worship, and in group competition in clothes, behavior, and material wealth to reinforce conformity.   Our first drive is survival. While it's nice to be able to trust others, a cursory glance at our written history proves who and what we are, and why romanticizing about what we'd like in this life can get us killed, especially if we're lone wolves, either by birth or by forced circumstances.
10orx4r,j6hnmuf,,Trust no one   Source:trust me bro
10orx4r,j6gog29,,Yes, I met two of my best friends on the street and one became my partner and he and I travel almost full time.
10orx4r,,j6goszl,Hey, thats wonderful to hear!. Yeah, it's no fun at all travelling (or being) alone. Everyone needs someone.
10orx4r,,j6gox2p,Thank you, for the first time in along time I‚Äôm truly happy and healthy.
10orx4r,j6gsazg,,Yeah it happens I'm probably not in your area but I'm always game to be friends with someone.
10orx4r,j6ig753,,I don't know. I haven't yet. Maybe I am the problem.
10orx4r,j6m1jl9,,it's hard to find but possible.
10orwjt,j6ks3yv,,Not sure about Denver or what their specific shelter policies are... I was on the streets in some of the smaller cities in CO. Wait till after mother's day if you can, that's usually our last day of frost. The dead of winter and late summer/early fall bring some deadly temps, so try to have a plan by then. It would be hard... but plenty have done it before.
10orwjt,j6gkolx,,I sent you a DM.
10orwjt,j6jzv9c,,Are you coming for homeless tourism? Do you have any skills?   We‚Äôre full to the brim with unhorsed folks even before the pandemic. Head over to r/Denver and ask there.   It‚Äôs not easy. Sure the resources might be there, but land is pricey and temperatures are very cold sometimes.   We just had three days of cold, two days of below 10deg temps. Boulder had no emergency shelter. Denver has only one open.   Come in the spring; make sure you get shelter by fall.
10orwjt,,j6kk2k2,Tourism? I'd be going there to start my life over from scratch.   How has no one seen my initial questions?
10orwjt,,j6lqzz4,No one has an exact answer. Each shelter has its own rules.   And not your personal army
10orwjt,,j6omlf9,Who said anything about a personal army?
10orwjt,j6l3ahj,, Do you have a vehicle? Before you move check out every place you think that you could work at, and also the resorts for seasonal work. Begin application process, and you may end up at a Burger King before another avenue opens, if you accept that then go for it. Getting yourself established early on would be a big help.
10orwjt,,j6l4zes,Ironically I worked for them for a week, they offered full-time and benefits, but I'm already working full-time.   Would it be hard to apply for a park ranger or lodging job that provides housing?
10orwjt,,j6l7bsp,I do not know what requirements for Park Ranger, have you thought about grounds keeper? Even sanitation jobs with the State?
10onxv3,j6ksuwc,,If you can find a pop can and some hand sanitizer, you can build yourself a little fire. Cut the can in half, poke holes about halfway down. Fill it up with hand sanitizer to just below the holes and light it. Careful you don't have any sanitizer on your hands.  It creates a small, hot, blue flame. Not easily visible from far out, won't really create shadows. It's not good to breathe in the fumes and it leaves this thick gritty coating on everything, but on the nights I would have died otherwise, I used to throw a tarp over me and let it burn under it... Dangerous and stupid but it kept me alive.
10onxv3,j6ftlik,,You gotta layer up
10onxv3,,j6fuan2,I said in the post that I do.. A bit more specific advice would be helpful.
10onxv3,,j6gucok,Undershirt/Shirt/hoodie/coat is what I wear to stay comfortable working in an office. If you're wearing 3 layers and it's not enough, wear more layers until you're comfortable
10onxv3,j6fvv6m,,any wooded area you could store a tarp /  tent sleeping bags blankets.
10onxv3,j6fwbnc,,Look for wool for midlayer, go double fleece if not then you need an outer shell coat that cuts wind and preferably waterproof, can find all that at thrift store. Also get waffle long johns for base layer should be able to get cheap at Walmart or dollar store. Double or triple socks, and waterproof insulated boots. You'll also need insulated gloves and headgear, preferably full face balaclava. Rain suits tear easy, you could also carry a tarp or even use a big trash bag for rain.   Insulating from ground is a must, multiple layers of cardboard is the easiest and cheapest, idk your set up but pallets or tires and building up off the ground with that is ideal if you really have room and privacy.   Most theft is people you know, so just be careful with that. A homemade monkey paw with a big ball bearing or pool ball even and Paracord on like 2 ft leash is a brutal weapon and good against a knife because you get distance and stopping power.
10onxv3,j6hqr9c,,You want ... tips??? .... for staying cold??? Tips to stay cold in the freezing rain???

10ol6yz,j6fnxvx,,Congratulations on your new journey!! We are proud of you. We need to see more of these feel good stories. How has the transition been for you?
10ol6yz,,j6fy75m,Thank you!! It was amazing but scary because I became homeless very suddenly and unexpectedly. So there‚Äôs always this fear that my housing can be ripped right under me. Right now I‚Äôm waiting for the apartment to get ready and they put me and my boyfriend and dog into a hotel free of charge. We got really lucky and despite the ptsd from homelessness I am forever humble and greatful for everything I have and this opportunity to better my life.
10ol6yz,j6fowlh,,Omg so proud of u !!! I‚Äôm trying to follow in ur footsteps it‚Äôs been rough for me, How did you get into transitional housing ??
10ol6yz,,j6fy01o,Thanks! And me and my boyfriend were sleeping in our car and people that help homeless (a homeless foundation) came down and asked if we needed any help and I guess they liked my boyfriend because I am very quiet and he has the gift of gab so they decided to push for us to get help it took awhile to get into transitional housing. It took about 4 months.  But we got into a transitional house then from their were connected to someone who placed us in our own apartment. We pay only 30% of rent for a year and they pay the rest. It was very lucky. And god sent. And the apartment is only $1000 in Los Angeles. And they pay 60% for the first year .I can finally buy everything I lost during homelessness back.   Los Angeles has a homeless problem so they do offer a lot of help also though.  I live in California and know that it‚Äôs a bit different than other states when it comes to help.
10ol6yz,,j6g3wyu,So happy for you! what a wonderful story . Just thank God and continue to do good in your new situation, keep working and always PAY THE RENT!! I know a lot of people for whatever reasons buy this or that and think they can let their rent slide, it should always be the first thing you do.  What a blessing your doggie has a place to stay also. Prayers for you and continued blessings!
10ol6yz,,j6gvrs2,Yes god has helped me so much and God held me when I felt like just giving up during my homelessness. the day before I was called to go into a transitional house I was outside with my boyfriend in 40 degree weather and he was sleeping and I was just crying staring up at the sky and praying to god to please help me and please help find me a house because I felt like I didn‚Äôt want to continue living anymore if it was going to be like that. The next day I got a call that the transition house was ready for us and that we could go to it! I plan on always being on time for the rent too! I came out of homelessness humbled and greatful for little things like a toilet a shower. I‚Äôm no longer greedy about things and don‚Äôt care about materialistic items. And also just I find myself being more understanding towards others. Homelessness felt like a curse at the time but once u start to come out you realize what god wanted to teach u. Before homelessness i was greedy and only cared about material items. I started to get a big ego because of the money I had before. And I felt I was too good for certain places like I just felt disgusted by little things like hotel rooms that weren‚Äôt 4 stars and I was raised that way to kind of have my nose in the air. God gave me a reality check lol. Am I‚Äôm happy I got it because I am a better more humbled and empathic person.  And I am so happy my dog isn‚Äôt outside anymore. He‚Äôs a way happier and healthy dog!  Thank you!! Stay blessed too!
10ol6yz,,j6jf6jo,I am really happy for you. My question is what has the boyfriend done to help your situation and to make sure that you guys don‚Äôt get homeless again? You both are pretty much going to have to remain steadily employed with an income. I hope he gets a job. You have to look out for yourself and it‚Äôs important that you cut people out if they are  just going to bring you down again.
10ol6yz,,j6kdr4c,He has a Job and has had it as soon as we got into transitional housing! I am waiting to be more situated in a house. There was never a problem with working. We are both able bodied it was one small mistake we made to end up homeless. We moved and packed our shit up without any thought. We made a dumb young mistake. He doordashed to keep us going for a year. We don‚Äôt live in the safest city so he was afraid if he went to work while we were homeless something would happen to me( which has happened just by him leaving for seconds at a time during homelessness). I had jobs during the time of homelessness but hotels in la are not cheap and it was hard to keep going and maintaining a job while sleeping in a car is too difficult for me personally. We just both suffer from bad depression and ptsd so we are getting control over our mental health. I‚Äôm going to a psychiatrist now. And he started working again after I felt he had given up on life during the homelessness. He didn‚Äôt drag me down. If anything we were acting the same. It was never a choice to be homeless. I believe god wanted that to happen to teach me a lesson about becoming humble. We are both in our early 20s and young and dumb. Now I learned what I need to do it I ever get in that situation again. Which I won‚Äôt.
10ol6yz,,j6l9iiy,Amen to that! Situations happen in life that makes us get closer to him, depend on him, after all He is our provider . I would suggest getting into a good Bible based church as well (if you arent already) Jesus is the change.
10ol6yz,j6glwxw,,Congratulations :) that's wonderful!

10ol6yz,,j6kvsqs,Thank you! It will get better just keep going on. Things always change . Nothing ever stays the same. That‚Äôs something that got me through homelessness was to always know that life is always changing and good doesn‚Äôt last forever but neither does bad,
10ol6yz,j7bamqi,,Congratulations on your apartment it is awesome. It will take time to feel ok again. I was in a shelter apartment with my kids and cat that we shared with another mother and her kids. We got into our own place in 2021. We have a beautiful 3 bedroom apartment. The first thing I do is pay the rent thats the first thing I do. We got all our furniture from our local buy nothing and everything is free groups. I told them we just got out of a shelter and had no car and they dropped off all our furniture and we got towels, kitchen items, everything we needed. If you can get a referral from the group that helped you they need to send an email and you can go to a furniture bank and pick out everything you need. Also if anything ever happens again God forbid, knock wood. This group in nevada helps with crates and free vet care and if you go on their website you can find free pet food donation sites and lots of resources. Keep it on hand.

10oja9p,j6jdx15,,All this only yields more stunted children, malnourished adults yet these "language restraint applied" want a military budget? How to wage a war when the citizens are too sick to fight. Year three thru a pandemic that always existed, every need is a terminal need about food and water. Too expensive.   Some days are so Fucking sad I become a bot and just have no strength when I experience food insecurity. I used quotes to remove a swearing statement. I noted food insecurity beginnibg in 2016.

I guess food doesn't matter either.   Priorities.  What are Americas priorities?   Education? Stunt that. Healthcare? Shame it. The list goes on. COVID destroyed so much.
10oja9p,j6fm4if,,The good news is that Californians got a raise a few months ago.  An individual now receives a maximum of $281.  I don't know if other states got similar raises.  [CalFresh program increasing benefits](https://abc7.com/calfresh-increase-inflation-rising-food-prices/12301090/)  "The increase in CalFresh benefits will run through September of next year."  (2023)  That part makes it sound like the increase is temporary, so don't be surprised if it gets rescinded later on.
10oja9p,,j6g46e1,is it true you can use your card at some fast food places also out there?
10oja9p,,j6gpmf0,Yes. It has to be dine in. I haven‚Äôt tried it but I did read some fine print. Also a lot of fast food in LA takes in. I‚Äôm a few hours up north and only 3 here that I know, accept it
10oja9p,,j6la0bo,but thats really nice , right? I know they do not offer that in Virginia. Which if you are hungry you want something then and now, and many dont have a kitchen to whip things up .
10oja9p,,j6ygh4m,It's sad how many states would deny that benefit to elderly, disabled and homeless people.  Because a hot rotisserie chicken is considered a "luxury" item.  üôÑ
10oja9p,,j706cgo,so crazy right?
10oja9p,,j6h0dfc,Yes, but it's not automatically switched on for all EBT cardholders.  You have to tell your social worker that you're homeless and that you don't have access to cooking facilities.  That should be enough to qualify for the hot meals program.  Then you can get fast food at participating restaurants.  I don't know which states offer this program, but it doesn't hurt to ask your social worker or DPSS office.  [Here's some information](https://www.ebtproject.ca.gov/Clients/calfreshrmp.html) about that.
10oiu3s,j6f3tx7,,Please check this out carefully before you commit. A legitimate, reputable company would not be advertising on Reddit for teachers. I have several friends who teach English remotely, but all work through accredited agencies and were recruited through sites like LinkedIn.  Another thing: The grammar in this notice sucks. If the people recruiting teachers don't know English well enough to write a coherent job description ... huge red flag.
10oiu3s,,j6fhfgv,Thank you for the word of caution. I will only pay in full after satisfactory completion of the interview and video.  There will be qualified professional to over see.  On grammatical error. Yes I could point out about 6-7  yes English is not my first language, but if I could convey the massage, that's fine.  Thank you again.
10oiu3s,j6f0cqn,,You should tell people the pay or at at least a rough idea of the pay here first. You should also tell people the time commitment needed. I am not in a tough position anymore but many people are and some might apply in hopes that they could possibly afford a bit more food for a while or something or be able to buy some more socks and pants or whatever. If they find out the pay is for example so low that it is not worth it, it could make their day worse. Homeless people have it hard enough as is and do not need any extra disappointments. Cheers.

And there is a demand for native English speakers, so....  It's worth looking into, if you're interested.

10oiu3s,,j6k3h2l,Can you explain to me why someone would look for teachers on a Reddit sub for the homeless? That doesn't make sense to me. The odds of finding someone here who's qualified to teach ESL seem slim. That's why I think this could be some sort of scam.
10oiu3s,,j6ljiop,It's a little fucking weird, right?  Kind of a strange place to pick up new talent. haha.  I agree, there's definitely something fishy going on.  Funny ya'll downvoting my post, as if it's bad advice though.  I never said that this particular company is (or isn't) reputable.

Well there's another 5 minutes of my life wasted trying to be nice and helpful.
10oiu3s,,j6lktvq,Yeah, don't know why anyone would downvote you.

10ohaam,j8i91m9,,While I can't personally answer your questions, I think it's really cool that you're trying to get first-hand perspectives for your essay. And comparing and contrasting cold climate homelessness vs. warm climate homelessness is definitely an interesting topic!   It's important to consider the unique challenges that people facing homelessness in different climates may encounter. For example, those experiencing homelessness in colder climates may have to contend with freezing temperatures, snow, and ice, while those in warmer climates may have to deal with extreme heat and dehydration.  n terms of shelter, people in cold climates may need to find ways to stay warm, such as seeking out heated buildings, using blankets or sleeping bags, or building makeshift shelters. In warmer climates, shade and access to water may be more important.   As for food, people experiencing homelessness may have to rely on food banks, soup kitchens, or other resources to get their meals. In colder climates, finding hot meals may be particularly important, while in warmer climates, access to refrigeration or cool storage may be more of a concern.   Overall, it's important to remember that homelessness is a complex issue with many different factors at play. It's great that you're trying to better understand the experiences of those facing homelessness in different climates.
10ohaam,,j8ibk4m,I agree!!

10og0jw,j6i0qd7,,For anyone applying for SSI/SSDI benefits, there is an expedited review and approval process for individuals experiencing homelessness called SOAR.  It requires a case manager with specific training and certification in the program to oversee your case and submit a narrative, but it can expedite the process to as little as 8 weeks. Many community service boards and some agencies coordinating support for homeless individuals, particularly veterans, have someone on staff to handle this. It‚Äôs extremely thorough in collecting required documentation, so approval rates are in the 70-80% range.

If you can't do either of those then I am sorry but you deserve to be hungry if you choose to be lazy.

As do many others. Another good resource.  Twitter "philanthropy" can be sketchy and should be approached w caution. There are a lot of scammers and as a result alot of in fighting and drama. Especially if someone accuses you-- you end up guilty without proof. Cash app on Twitter does give aways. Venmo too. PayPal. And pizza hut .. those can be competitive but worth a chance.

So if you don't have a mailing address that can be a bummer.   Facebook has a lot of free groups (great spot to ask for cans!) and Amazon wish list groups , as well as local philanthropy but as always keep cautious and be smart, don't ruin it for those who need it (üëâ disclaimer for those looking to just make waves) because it's life or death for some folks.

Im skinny as it is and a bit afraid of being anorestic. Im not used to this at all and feel overwhelming depression as i really dont want to beg unless if im on deaths door. I just need a job and on my paycheck i can get a tent than a roomate maybe. There has to be a way out there has to be. You have no idea how much i appreciate your advice thankyou trully.
10oecik,,j6ea02r,Watch for the helpers.  They‚Äôre out here. Don‚Äôt beg unless you have to, but there‚Äôs generous souls out here who look for the needy and will do what they can. Caveat: watch out for the creeps who try to prey on the desperate.  The legit good ones usually park their car and walk to you, hand out helpful stuff at known homeless areas.  Libraries, shelters etc.  They‚Äôll offer socks, outer wear food water hygiene items.   Good luck.  Stay safe.
10oecik,,j6edluo,Honest food is the least of your hurdles. Food is readily avail for us , using apps you can get free take out fast food. Food banks food kitchens etc are all pretty plentiful. And reddit has a lot of threads for free meals.   If you can provide a zipcode I can give you local resources.
10oecik,,j6gw9zz,I almost forgot - check your area for "same day pay work" most places have agencies like Labor Ready/People ready who essentially you go, sign up for same.day work, they assign you a job w a company who needs help (alot of office work, construction, fast food etc) you work your shift then they pay you that day.   https://www.usa.gov/help-with-bills  https://www.211.org/  https://www.needhelppayingbills.com/  https://www.findhelp.org/

10oecik,,j6e8xkz,New plasma donations pay up to $1000 for first time donors. Ya need I'd, proof of address and just be healthy. Definitely look into it!
10oecik,,j6edcow,Plasma pays good for first time donors but you need an ID, social security number and an address First and foremost you need ID. Does your mom have your birth cert? Ask for it. You need ID to do anything and you dont want to be one of these people that has no id, no job, no money and its a shitty existence.   Start reaching out to any homeless outreach that can help you get situated and maybe a job. Post on a local facebook group or nextdoor....instead of global forums lie this where its hard for anyone to know your area.

10oecik,,j6hv42w,well, when I was homeless I had a small knife and my skateboard. so I'd say either something small or a skateboard if you have one, nobody wants to get hit by a plank of wood with metal attached to it. but the best defense is just run away.
10oecik,,j6hw93w,also don't trust anybody you meet on the streets, you have no idea what intentions they have and you'll likely have to walk around some nights, just keep your eyes and ears open and if something doesn't feel right then trust your gut.

10o5cha,j6dwtbw,,I know. When I was homeless and barely legal I was told I was outside because I was ‚Äòtoo prideful‚Äô to have sex in exchange for a place to stay or food to eat. Both before and after I was trafficked because a friend ‚Äòknew someone‚Äô but it was really her ex she dumped because he pressured her for sex and she didn‚Äôt want to. Turns out they preyed on homeless girls, not that she knew that but still.   Even after there are people who want to force you to or con you into things that make you feel dirty and no shortage of people who will both blame you if you do and blame you if you don‚Äôt both.  I try to avoid it or situations like that. I don‚Äôt always manage them well so it‚Äôs best to avoid them. Plan how I‚Äôll react to try to be more prepared. Like if someone asks to see my lady bits I‚Äôve already got a plan to show them my actual cat instead etc. Stuff I don‚Äôt have some mental plan for‚Ä¶? Freeze up unsure what to do‚Ä¶ sometimes it is managed badly.  There is no shortage of people to feel entitled to you, your body, demands over your mental or emotional well-being or even who will act like physical and disability related limitations don‚Äôt exist if you are desperate enough.   Desperation makes people push limits but sometimes things are too far, especially if you are already pushing yourself to the point of pain and being laid up sometimes and barely functioning trying to make it work for your family or even just to survive itself.   People like that have never existed in such extremes where they have been pushed to that extreme where no matter how much they ‚Äòmind over matter‚Äô there is simply nothing left to DO that with and trying ends up causing insane damage and possibly killing them. They‚Äôve never dealt with it either mentally or physically. Never faced situations that made them beg for death just to escape the suffering.  Those people have no empathy for people who know and have or are currently experiencing them.   The only thing I can offer to such people is that if you survive it will not always be as it is now.   I had a quiet life where I had time to face the things I‚Äôd been through even if by myself because the therapy available where I lived was sparse and unhelpful. I deeply appreciated that life. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever have it back but I‚Äôll try to help my family reclaim the stability we managed to carve out in this fucking dystopian nightmare of a country. (Dystopias are never so to the people who don‚Äôt have to have the experiences that force them to see the things that happen ‚Äòin the dark‚Äô or otherwise when they‚Äôve no power in a situation and someone or a group of people decides to take advantage of the situation and extract what they DO have for themselves no matter the cost to that person nor there family, if they have one).   People suck. People are never as strong as they think they are when actually faced with this stuff and it‚Äôs often those people who crack first. I imagine some part of them knows that and that is why they react with such denial that such despair exists.

I took pics of art, their aviation displays were impressive. i just cant eat food that a pet walked into. its just too much risk but i said nothing and the plate was half completed. it was just veggies and protein iwas working on. its ok. i understand where my fren was coming from and agreed im wasteful. sure i call myself a million names im not. i once told a real prick of a human hes one of those cruelty artists im trash. why not. words about words - that dysregulation happens in me too. its ok to friend it, confess it, and move past it by loving the person anyhow. see a person thats recovering from pleurisy, tired, worn out, isnt in the game of fighting or responding to what are good points its just i cant return to a plate that a pet walked thru. its called not ok. again i said nothing. because its the idea they took me in, be grateful. i cleaned and wheezed hard but i wanted to help. their environemnt matters to me. i felt spending christmas and serbian christmas with them was very important. lifelong freinds and im complaining im such a piece of shit. it was a trip i had meant to take in 2021 2020 before this homelss stint manifested. i wont be moved Bby ingratitude even if i bought the food and cooked the food. it was a bought and cooked because they were taking me in. the same with other minor digs its just how pple think and im so existential these days so many existing issues are minor to me. nothing for me to reply about or express my inability to eat certain foods after a beloved pet walked thru. its called eat it anyway but for my body as fucked up as it is, its just a ER trip I dont feel like enduring. i went to spend quality time with them not fight or be disagreeable or annoy anyone with a ER trip or vomit. we sang songs in the car, talked about life, futures, did a few projects together, spent quality time! we walked an amazing dog and I got to hold two cats that initally didnt come around me. they snuggled up to me at night. it meant something to me to be witth my freinds for christmas and just be there. case mgmt rattled me hard earlier this month and said if idont race back to okc they stop services. i said its ok no one but me is looking for housing its my role my job. in being back i asked their office for help on a few things, cold shoulders but not really theytoo  took me in and they too are struggling and food is food. its just risks i cannot take. i place peace over being right over a few pieces of food that was barely a dollar if i go even more detailed.

10o5cha,,j6ejrdx,[deleted]
10o5cha,,j6ek9pe,Such double talk.   It‚Äôs the internet dear. This is a forum on the internet. Anyone can jump in and many things have multiple people talking about them.   If you have a problem with that then you have a problem with forums and are in the wrong place.
10o5cha,,j6e8ztp,yes, its often lashing out in pain, its all pain mgmt.
10o5cha,j6dynzb,,I‚Äôm guilty of when they post ‚Äúhow can I get gas for my car ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫‚Äù or whatever, in my head I‚Äôm thinking, I have a profound disability and I fucking work two full time jobs and have slept in a car for over a year. I have fucking negative 10000000 sympathy for people who just simply don‚Äôt want to work. *You don‚Äôt work, you don‚Äôt fucking eat.* Get off your lazy asses, stop smoking meth, and maybe you could afford gas in your car.
10o5cha,,j6e3wly,I cant find work man.  I want nothing more than just an opportunity to change this.  It is my fault i got fired at my last job but that is because i lost my temper on a coworker. I just want to put in the work as hard as i can and eventually start my own family. I ask for forgiveness and just a fighting chance everyday. I hate begging and the feeling that i will have to very soon.  I am so lost and i have no empathy for those addicted to drugs or even just doing crime. I just want to prove everyone wrong about me and where im at.  When i was highschool people/teachers/students  told me i would be homeless because i never would show up i would try and sell weed smoke weed get into fights. But that is it. The hardest thing ive done is alcholol and im not going to be able to smoke weed for years to come so i dont believe i desserve this but it is what it is and im searching hard rn because im very lost even just as a human i feel disconnected to say the least
10o5cha,,j6e4k8u,You‚Äôve got this dude. I found solid work climbing and cutting trees for the utility company. If you truly want to crawl out of poverty, you fucking WILL. Keep that fucking FIRE in your belly burning. You WILL have a career and a family if that is what you want, but you have to put in solid work every single day that you wake up
10o5cha,,j6e6kdp,Thankyou man trully, i have screenshotted your reply and will read it to always remind me. There has to be a way out, i will not allow it to end like this. That is a great idea i will save up money maybe get a lawnmower or tree trimmer and ask around to do work and do the best i possibly can. Thankyou
10o5cha,,j6ecfly,Yeeaaaaahhh!!!!! That is really good advice!! I'm going to save this as well.
10o5cha,,j6egjrg,In a lot of these cases it's profound mental disorder. Depression looks like laziness. Mental illness is invisible. Most  won't even believe they're depressed because they don't feel sad.  People who turn to drugs weren't mentally healthy in the first place.
10o5cha,,j6e2r7m,agree. stop spending all your money on cigs and 420. Get a job that is not shitty gig job but a gig job like door dash and uber eats is better than nothing.
10o5cha,,j6e9iy9,I understand!! Having a disability and sleeping in a car sounds like absolute h*ll. He wasnt asking for money, he was stranded with none and nearby a gas station. I'm pretty sure that he was working, just in a bad scenario.   But I understand the frustration when it comes to the people who dont want help and ruin it for everyone else.  It definetly makes it harder for the rest of us.
10o5cha,,j6krmtw,So your saying you do the same mental gymnastics to justify your prejudices and negativity just like the pricks who treat the homeless like scum and tear down tents and shit? Just because you struggle or struggled doesn‚Äôt mean someone else isn‚Äôt deserving of help because they havnt overcome their obstacles yet.   That mentality will just make you a bitter and hateful person, and worst of all part of the problem.
10o5cha,,j6lcva5,Okay well when Uncle Sam makes the problem go away, I‚Äôll change my stance on not having sympathy for those that won‚Äôt help themselves.
10o5cha,,j6eql9o,forgive yourself. grant yourself grace.  you dont eat you dont work is a common theme pple balance or manage. its so much change into each decade roles, ideas and trends impacted the stance of if you dont work you dont eat. illness and health can make decisions for us at times try to not to be tough on yourlsef and others. you too need rest and have worked very hard in life. today or this era a person can eat and survive if they dont or cant work there is snap and a safety net and yes i know its expensive...just saying i canhear your side.
10o5cha,j6ed9jg,,We need to build eachother up. Say "You got this" instead of "quit being whiny". Lean on eachother, not to an extreme, but just let yourselves feel for a bit, you can be tough afterwards. The fear of not being able to pull yourself together after that is real, but we have all survived much worse. When we are all out of this is when our compassion will come back, its not gone. Its because we are burntout.   BURNOUT IS REAL!!! Please do what you can to treat yourself when you can. Let yourself cry if possible (I havnt been able to cry for years).   I LOVE YOU ALL, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, EVEN THOUGH I DONT KNOW YOU. PLEASE DONT GIVE UP, DONT HURT YOURSELVES, AND DO YOUR BEST TO SUPPORT EACHOTHER  I LOVE YOU ALL!!!! DEEP BREATHS AND COMFORT FOR ALL OF YOU  I PROMISE YOU, NONE OF THIS WILL LAST FOREVER
10o5cha,j6goupg,,I've noticed already from my short time on this forum that there are a couple of Trolls who have nothing better to do than stir up reactions from the Homeless. Downvote them and hopefully we can get rid of them ASAP.
10o5cha,j6eicoo,, i dont have the heart or hate to fight. in my life it was once said i use toomuch soap. I laughed, thot, yep i know. but women do that, theres alot to scrub. its just how life is.
10o5cha,,j6eihgc,That's a good way to put it, thank you for that
10o5cha,,j6ekm6a,thank you for being here. i ramble on, long winded, sorry about that. thank you reddit.
10o5cha,,j6el193,Thank you for also being here! Dont worry, that is what reddit is for :)
10o5cha,,j6eijmd,We need more comforting wisdom like this to be shared
10o5cha,,j6iua50,How are you today?   I'm iced over in OKC. Case mgmt ignored me, office henhouse routine with their staff.
10o5cha,j6doexz,,I'm sorry but "man up" remains one the best things to do, especially on the streets! I refer y'all to R.A. The Rugged Man - 50,000 Heads . I know some people respond best to sweet little nothings, but that's not kindergarten any more, it's the University of Hard Knocks
10o5cha,,j6drcfx,Yeah, and there's a lot of newbs in the university, and there's going to be a lot more. It's better to hand them a flashlight and a tutor, than hazing them.
10o5cha,,j6dxyne,Agreed. Even for those who experienced it before there are new difficulties such as resources often being capped out already by other people because it wasn‚Äôt enough before and there sure as hell is even less now. Programs are often walked back before the ink properly even dries on a ‚Äòproject‚Äô. Programs are often tokens, there to look like they are doing something.   People who believed in them are now finding out that is what they are and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs quite shocking that not only that but the people who are homeless but work and who should be helped by programs to prevent it are not helped and are even turned away help despite ‚Äòthat can‚Äôt happen‚Äô etc etc etc.   That shit is hard even when it‚Äôs not a shock to the system because you knew it your entire life that things didn‚Äôt work the way they say, let alone how they should, far more often than they do.   The fact those have not truly met the needs before all this stuff and now more and more people are being added but there is ‚Äòno room at the inn‚Äô and all the measures that let them feel like there were fewer than there are while pretending those programs help more people than they do, let them pretend it was less than it was so they could pretend token efforts work‚Ä¶ is now not there to protect them from reality anymore.   Probably at least a portion of the people speaking are also speaking because they are angry such people who were like that before are now so effected by things some people have been experiencing for decades. Others are those people spouting crap because fear.   Whether it‚Äôs that or something else we shouldn‚Äôt make a hard situation harder when we don‚Äôt have to. It isn‚Äôt helpful and too many people have it hard in the first place and it‚Äôs only going to get worse from here.
10o5cha,,j6e98zp,aww, this! awards to your post.
10o5cha,,j6dsu57,I agree. There's most often nobody but you that is going to do anything for you. The world is a cold hard place that doesn't give a fuck about you. The sooner you learn that the better off you'll be.  That said... The only times I've given someone shit in a bad situation is when they were copping an attitude, refusing to listen to the advice being offered, and generally acting like someone else owed them the act of solving their problems. As cold as it seems, nobody owes you anything, life is never going to be fair, and it's up to you and only you to change your situation.  Although, I do agree that we should help eachother when we can, and not intentionally be dicks to people who are truly struggling.   If you come correct people you never expected will help you.
10o5cha,,j6e9de4,yes, its on me. its also on me to stay thankful and hang in there. alot of strong pple here that inspire me.
10o5cha,,j6dxsh6,Just because it‚Äôs hard doesn‚Äôt mean we have to make it harder on one another. You never know who is struggling so hard that could push them over the edge. People kill themselves over being told that shit. It‚Äôs not helpful.
10o5cha,,j6dz2v3,I'm genuinely curious, do you have some legitimate stats on that?
10o5cha,,j6dzdql,I learned it from experience and being told there was no help left for us in too many things, but I could look it up on the off chance someone with the resources cares enough to have done so. In general, however, even news has acknowledged there wasn‚Äôt enough in the first place and now there is effectively less with far more people vying for the programs and resources.  It doesn‚Äôt help that there are things and people who raise prices to take advantage of such programs and that, too, causes problems.   The rental assistance programs ran out of money, in part, because of that and we wouldn‚Äôt be in our current situation had they not or even simply had they had more people working on it to get to people before they ended up in those situations. It happens though. Some people get the help and others do not. Some people get called six months later and told the program ‚Äòran out of money‚Äô but by then the situation has obviously changed.  Some people who were squeaking by were even pushed by rent hikes designed to force them on those programs, as if the money was Infinite, and a whole lot got the same idea. Our landlord was only one of many and it was such a prevalent idea he spoke it to us openly and even told us he was doing us a favor despite it being opposite to that.   My family may never recover from this. On top of that companies bought up a lot of properties and anyone thusly effected in that way has ended up effectively banned from housing unless they stay under the radar with others who can still qualify. People with previously squeaky clean rental histories now have evictions and judgements on them now, because the situations they were in were simply impossible and between death and that there was no choice. Many landlords take advantage of people with stuff like that too, so even with private landlords it‚Äôs not squeaky clean either. A whole LOT of people are now stuck in impossible situations they didn‚Äôt realize existed before. And yet it has. It‚Äôs simply worse now and with more people.  Anyone with eyes can see it. Some places have more homeless camped out than entire towns have in population. I have a brother in Georgia whose described a camp you cannot see the end of. Stuff like that didn‚Äôt exist before. Even the largest camps weren‚Äôt that big. Yet they exist and they exist multiple places and in multiple states.   I don‚Äôt need numbers to see it because I have eyes. Numbers can tell us more succinctly down to the wire but at some point ‚Äòfire is hot‚Äô.
10o5cha,,j6eaoh0,[deleted]
10o5cha,,j6fykfs,I can‚Äôt argue with that. ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù is indeed the proper name for it.
10o5cha,,j6eh71k,It'd be my first response. F that noise, I'm out.
10o5cha,,j6ea9fc,Being able to "Man up" is definetly needed for survival, I agree. But people break eventually. And when they break and that is all the advice that they are met with, they have already tried that.
10o5cha,,j6ei3pw,Most people out there are suffering from mental disorders and you can't just bootstrap your way out. If anything, just telling people to man up makes you feel better because if it happens to you then you feel like you can just 'willpower' your way out the situation. The chronic illness community faces this rhetoric constantly. Sometimes shitty things happen to people where they can't get out on their own.
10o5cha,j6e8bnt,,thank you for being here. i almost posted pictures of stuff here this month but i ran out of data so i cannot post pics. heres something joyful for a hug from me to you [https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthIsland/comments/10o9ux8/puppy\_sunday\_formals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthIsland/comments/10o9ux8/puppy_sunday_formals/)  love earth, love others, do small things to love and care for yourself you must carry on. this stint in life is going to improve.
10o5cha,j6gkz0a,,People tend to call out obviously compulsive liars on Reddit and that‚Äôs fine with me.
10o5cha,j6jo6do,,Too often the advice you do get is like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/e72fx/reddit_sympathy/).
10o5cha,j6e804f,,i love your post, needed to be said, thank you. per the rules no judging was written.   agape one another with good data, helpful tips and try to stay warm, stay well, stay sane. when pple are unkind to me I understand why, get her outta here, homeless person, gross, etc., only I shower and take damn good care of myself. some pple hate self care. I try to apply that my situation is a minor temporary take it one day at a time. i lol at drinking and my so called older problems, im homeless in truck but haven't drank in such a long time. I noted how different prices are for booze in other states. I traveled often last month and this month. i treat the homeless adventure as a existing issue to manage not stay in but its a wait. i was mentioning a good chanell minds in unison and vortex success at youtube, great playlists, delightful sounds, classical music subliminals. i drank over my parents health getting older/dying.grief. 2021 met a wicked landlord that needed HUD pple out. they used cameras against pple. tech is here to help not hurt pple. written up over bullshit, evitcted like a clown and im working with four housing authorities. vouchers are being released rapidly and landlords are moving pple in.   just to vent.   sure case mgmt told me to leave my friends house and stay in my car or she'd end services, that happened this stupid month. one housing authority said i have to go thru her agency for housing representation. i said, no, heres the application from me, whats case mgmt care? they are denying me help for food, gas and its really not even their job but im on ssi. i felt case mgmt are more than happy to watch me suffer and laugh at me at their fucking housing meetings. the city wants homeless pple dead as far as I am concerned. I spent money I dont have to rush back, two week later, they denied me food, denied me help with gas and said, but we already helped you last year. we cant help today or later heres a appointment. sure a appointment on a snowy day for a homeless woman to drive to, for what?? for case mgmt to scold me about missing appointments. gee, i have to find food, laundry services, repair things, manage meds, cope with poor health and im the bad guy? I love that, its so anti logic so anti hero. I didnt even fight I just said yeah plurisy decided my fate its not related to my choices the body simply got sick and I simply stopped living in the car to stay with a freind and attend two retreats that Ive been to for 22 years. this is the first time they saw me homeless and said stay longer, forget leaving in a few days. stay a week.  my narc said how awful i am for going to art retreats Ive attended all my life. hes brand new to my life the last few years, hes another hater. one night last year, he pushed me hard andmade up a story to his parents about me. his parents told me after a few days of staying wtih them to leave and I was fine with that due to the story their son told them. been thru these games before and i didnt fight or defend myself. no energy to defend myself. shits that bad. I thanked them for the few days and lost my food. they kept my food in their fridge I was leaving back to my car and needed milk, needed cold food but no. nope. they are all at church today praising god. they later found my bible at their house and said come get it. it was tucked under the bed they gave me to sleep in. gratitude for the stay. they were unhappy with me because I slept in the first few days I was there. they had NO empathy for tired body in a car unable to sleep well. but they are the super chosen peeps. its all good. i said nothing. i later was awake and moving by 5 or 6 am but they judged me so hard I laughed I thought, let them talk, love them anyway for the short time there and be comfy.   i felt it was a all repeat from my old family life growing up and thought nothing i say would matter, dont fight and just leave back to vehicle. being alone with my art is my best outcome its whats bset for my care plan and life.   i pray hard for pple here and i know alot of pple have god issues. me too. i told god he hates me and hates ON his creation - all heartache. I know im wrong but its ok to wrong, tired, old, exhausted, depleted. another lady mentioned here about weird messages shes gotten for commenting, good comment louder and the messages fade. once pple find out you know who you are, what you want and where you are going they leave you alone. thats my experience with life. sure i love my narc but not enough to be shit on in the 2nd half of my life. for mentalhealth ive found i cant be with anyone its me, like the anti hero song by taylor swfit, lol. im thankful for all the help ive received its ahy i dont lash out in return or explain myself. I apply the DEEP technique and accept that explaining or asking them to have feelings are all present but its that they dont like me or want me around and thats ok. when not wanted just walk away. back east I had a situation where my circle and this other guy would try to walk into my life to insult my art. he called it circles and squares then put down moving my body over my dance routines. i dance or pratcie balet in the woods im insane and I freind it and do it out there and no one sees me. invisible me.

10o4e4v,,j6cmw7f,I'm not sure
10o4e4v,j6dvrsk,,Any ideas of a way to get from Illinois to Texas
10o4e4v,,j6ehzqn,There's some place in Illinois that can get you an ID voucher, I'm sure of it. Once you have your ID, get a bus ticket. If you have to, just make a sign and panhandle for the ticket. Lots of people will want to help you travel I'm sure. Its honestly easier than panhandling for food.
10o4e4v,j6cmkxa,,Well I want to go bck to South Texas but I don't know how cause I don't have a ID and there is no help in this shit hole of a town
10o4e4v,,j6e3w30,you need to get your ID replaced. Homeless organzations can help. How do you intend on getting a job without ID?
10o4e4v,j6gdznp,,Flying is cheaper. Spirit to Houston is only $55.
10o4e4v,j6k7za7,,Pick a direction and get some supplies to survive.  And get out of that shit state. I grew up in Illinois and glad I left that place.

10nu7za,,j6bntpy,How much was it ü§î
10nu7za,,j6crg88,$10.72
10nu7za,,j6biney,Dollar Tree hasem, they have no business being as good as they are  Edit: just open one side of the bag after removing from the box and nuke it for just over a minute
10nu7za,j6c7h71,,I used to always grab a bag of the Brims's popcorn at the dollar tree. Best bang for your $1.25 imo. Big ass bag filled with product and not air.
10nu7za,j6bjc0e,,I love those sandwiches! You should also try those shredded chicken burritos in the black package. Best $1.25 ive ever spent. Dollar tree right?
10nu7za,,j6e20ku,Ngl the Jamaican chicken patty things are good, they dont have a lot of meat but its better than a hot pocket.
10nu7za,j6b5lwi,,nice score
10nu7za,j6bjksp,,Thos sandwiches are really good, stay warm brother
10nu7za,j6brk78,,Enjoy you spread
10nu7za,j6dmww7,,Dollar tree saved my life so many times.
10nu7za,j6e2d0w,,Sorry so many people are utter A-holes. Glad you got yourself a meal and have that microwave access. Hope you were able to enjoy it and it‚Äôs not too cold where you‚Äôre at.
10nu7za,,j6e49sj,Hot in Florida
10nu7za,j6ce6sb,,I do like Fast Bites sandwiches.  They are better when you have something to put on them, like hot sauce or ketchup.
10nu7za,j6e1t3t,,Those sammies are delicious for their price. I'd take 4 of those over a gas station sandwich any time even tho i eat them chilly sometimes.
10nu7za,j6ei5c2,,that looks like nice warm food. is anyone familiar with the 711 microwave? they let pple heat food up i think, or where i traveled tehy dont mind.
10nu7za,j6cxcc5,,I can see you're on SAD, Standard American Diet
10nu7za,,j6czoty,I‚Äôm homeless, that means no refrigerator access so where am I going to get a more healthy diet besides fast food and microwaveable foods? Use ur brain dude
10nu7za,,j6e4ti8,We eat what we can when we can, sometimes what we have available to us is a bit more unhealthy than what we would prefer.  I don't care if I do or do not have a fridge, If i can't find something that is going to be healthier than what I'd prefer I'd rather take my chances. My point: Sometimes the food we'd rather have is out of budget even for the housed folks, and with or without a place to keep perishables, OP is in the right. I saw the M&M boxes and I was like, "okay at least it's an enegy source." Survival 101 if you have foods that keep your energy up and allow you to function then you use them to your advantage,  ration if needed.  I'm diabetic so I have to watch intake, however like I said above we can't always be picky with our choices. I encourage as healthy as possible eating no matter what. OP is probably doing just that. Cheers OP and hopefully you can pick up something better in the near future. meanwhile keep up doing what you're doing. Stay Safe!
10nu7za,,j6d38i9,why be so defensive, I know all that and more. I recommend a diet of cheese and bananas.
10nu7za,,j6d8nfl,I‚Äôll eat healthier, send me money
10nu7za,,j6dk3f1,As long as you're warm, we know you're going to survive this ordeal, even if you turned your back on a quick meal or two. Or 100. What I'm more worried is if you die inside, and not being able to laugh at yourself, homeless or housed, is a sure-fire way to die inside. Now, I know the mods will see kindly at this soft-begging of yours, as they will probably think I provoked you. That was not my intention. My intention was to discuss how to eat better when money and options are limited. For example MnMs are inferior, I think, to standard chocolate, and if you educate yourself on the matter then you can post me a thank you note. If this is stuff that were given to you then I won't feel guilty either. But I do seem to have more money than you currently, and I have nothing against tithing. So if I'm your only possible source of a tomato, parmesan cheese and some fruit, be my guest.
10nu7za,,j6e2c6y,Bruh you're really going at them for having m&ms? Candy is one of the most healthy things people could consume as a treat on the street. I'd choose my vice to be some sugar over crack, even nicotine, any day.
10nu7za,,j6efscp,There are better sugars, that's all. Even bananas with sugar sprinkled on top competes with any desert for "kick", except perhaps for creamy deserts, but even then you could steroid up your banana with cream or full fat cream and outwit outplay outlast outcompete most foods. Like I said I wanted to have the food quality discussion. Even if this particular stuff was the only thing the OP could get for the day.
10nu7za,,j6dl6nf,Soft begging? Ur the one calling it an ‚ÄúAmerican Standard Diet‚Äù so if ur so concerned on what I EAT, buy my food. I made the post showing everyone my dinner, not asking for advice on dental work, or calorie count.  I noticed no matter what u post online, ppl are automatically hard wired to hate. Post food, ur fat. Post about a new job and ppl rag on u for not getting a better job
10nu7za,,j6dxpsj,you're off your rocker, I neither hate you nor fight you, quite the opposite. I repeat my recommendation, if you can price/buy some parmesan, tomatoes and fruit close to where you are, and you like it because it is not my intention to torture you with cheese, I'll pay for it. Hopefully you're a) well-banked or well-unbanked b) going to post the pic
10nu7za,,j6fnydu,wtf? redditors in a nutshell lmao
10nu7za,j6bg7hh,,Bruh that‚Äôs gonna wreak havoc on your teeth and offers little nutrition. This will just end up giving you more problems to deal with.
10nu7za,,j6bgwy9,you really can't be picky when your homeless
10nu7za,,j6c8zn8,I second this, also can't be picky when you're housed and are barely making ends meet either at times.
10nu7za,,j6c9amm,yup. there were many nights when all I had was spam n bread.
10nu7za,,j6c9w50,I have to remind my partner that she can't be picky about the dinners sometimes.  thankfully she got her EBT back and can get her stuff without cheese in it when her system is acting up and there's cheese in the free meals.
10nu7za,,j6caaow,sometimes you gotta be thankful for what you do have because you very well could have nothing tomorrow.
10nu7za,,j6crkfj,Right lol
10nu7za,j6bc1ag,,Empty calories
10nu7za,,j6bepet,I mean, dude's likely lacking the option of something more substantial.
10nu7za,,j6bgy87,exactly
10nu7za,,j6c8u38,Not as empty as you think. there's probably 60-80g of protein betweeen the burgers so it's at least helping to prevent op from loosing energy and getting sick. ---Sticker says they're 17g each I thought they were beef, missed the chicken label.
10nu7za,,j6e2m0i,So is a jar of peanut butter and bananas but yall types always seem to recommend that.
10nu7za,,j6kove5,Your heart is fucking empty
10nu7za,j6fv9eh,,I get those dollar tree burgers and put a bunch of great value sauces on it fir an extra flavor hit for cheap. Jalape√±o cheese hot dogs at Walmart and $1 bag of great value buns also go good with the sauces
10nu05o,j6bkvkm,,There's nothing America hates more than poor people, and no one's poorer than the homeless. 'Twas ever thus.
10nu05o,j6awofg,,Gotta try escape. They c u as a threat
10nu05o,j6b3hpr,,Sounds like you're in a nasty city... Get out if you can. When I was homeless for a week about new years, I went to a pretty secluded town of about 8000 and the people were much nicer with dignity.  All Lincoln Party conservative type people with good values and I didn't see anyone with hate in their heart
10nu05o,,j6b5088,Yeah, the small towns can often be some of the nicest ones. I've been in several like that (both liberal and conservative) and the few resources they did have turned out to be much better than the ones in the large metro cities and not nearly as crowded or violent.
10nu05o,j6bqcsg,,That sounds like about it.   I got 'housed' and it isn't much different.
10nu05o,j6ay85i,,There's stories like that in every part of the country, even in the places with "nice" shelters or "a lot" of homeless services like LA or the SF Bay Area.  Maybe the shelter doesn't have bed bugs, but it's where cops dump untreated schizophrenics and manic episode freakouts, and they aren't equipped to deal with that, so everyone's on edge and now people are fighting because "what the fuck are you looking at" or "quit fucking talking to yourself. Who did you call a faggot?"  And if you keep every possession you have on you at all times, it usually doesn't get stolen.  Sadly that means sleeping with shoes on.  This is what happens when we let the government outsource something it should be doing itself to a disjointed patchwork of non-profits who don't communicate, fight for limited resources, don't spend efficiently, pay thier director generously, pay their staff shit, pick and choose their clients and aren't held accountable for results or outcomes.    At least you can usually get a meal, and a badly photocopied flier about some other non-profit that also can't help you, or some affordable housing lottery to get your hopes up.
10nu05o,,j6bfwmb,excellent take. yes.
10nu05o,j6bfrxw,,yeah. i was accused of stealing. I presented my data, requested mgmt and cleared my name. their cameras mistook me for another person in the same coat with similar glasses. but yeah i was parking at a nice 24/7 store. mger said im in his book for actions the store doesnt like. I said, ok lets work this out. im a local artist and almost housed but yeah im homeless and struggling. my parents and family had stores, no shoplifting then or now.
10nu05o,j6d3c1x,,Yes, only in America!
10nu05o,j6dd5ez,,Land of the free, home of the brave.
10nu05o,,j6dk4tl,Correction: land of the fee, home of the slave üòÇ
10nu05o,j6cy395,,An average Tuesday
10nu05o,j6cy3zn,,An average Tuesday
10nu05o,j6d52xt,,Yes I have absolutely almost gotten in the car with strangers until I realized they had no clothes on from the waist down. The first time I was 14 years old. I don‚Äôt remember how many times it has happened. Sure wish I could be reborn in a loving family but instead I had a drug crazed mother and now I don‚Äôt know how to fix the life she so maliciously destroyed.
10nu05o,j6efmv9,,Yeah, I'm already well aware of the dynamics here. Which is why I travel straight and never hitchhike.   I am currently homeless in north beach SF. If you're cleanish, it's easy enough to get by. There are 4 or 5 meal programs within 3 miles of me. All open during weekday mornings.   Also getting around to get your needs taken care of is doable. The bus system has light / no security. You can hop on and hop off and noone will say anything. Lots of locals included in that unspoken system   It's not easier though. 8/10 people are just stuck up. People don't talk to me because they believe I'm a hiding drug addict and they have trust issues, so they'd never believe the truth coming from me.  They are actually more likely to help the half naked shit covered crackheads outside. Those being the few people that *need* to be in inpatient care.   So yeah you'll probably feel like a dog getting kicked around wherever you go
10nu05o,j6dkekw,,Go to a smaller city it‚Äôs just goin to b safer if u have to be homeless.
10nsei4,j6al7ne,,Like wwoof or workaway. I used to host but don‚Äôt anymore.
10nsei4,,j6amrmw,For a while, I was interested in wwoof because they're the only organization that goes to Lasqueti island, my dream destination. Unfortunately, you have to buy land or a house to be able to move in - unless you know somebody, that is.
10nq363,j6d0a5c,,Drop some money on services that really work.  Words are just words.  What practical measures is this expert doing that actually makes a difference to the homeless he is an expert on?
10nq363,j6e7fyk,,How much did they pay him??!
10npu42,j6a66tj,,Probley be best just to ask him
10npu42,,j6ajfmj,That probably would be best, but I'm just hesitant to ask. Too many bad experiences >.<. I'll try to muster up the courage to ask
10npu42,j6aiekz,,is there a large population of homeless in his area? If so the 2 bags are easier to stash and hide and not have stolen where with a cart, he then has something someone else instantly wants and if its anything like here in Houston, as soon as he falls asleep theyll take it and everything in it. If his bags have handles get a few large Caribiners that you can fit your hand in, they make for great handles for multiple bags
10npu42,,j6aj9l4,You're right. I didn't think about that. He sleeps about a block away from the transit center and I see many homeless people there. Caribiners sounds like a good idea though.
10npu42,,j6am1pl,I used them when I was homeless to do the same and i walk to the grocery store now and still put all my bags on a caribiner for easier transport, but what you do save on the cart maybe some socks, underwear (these wear out the fastest being homeless even if you are able to wash and take care of them. Small things to help keep warm and i always found water was the easiest thing to come by but it was always a special treat for a drink mix
10npu42,j6b4y0t,,Not an answer to your question but I'll share an experience. I saw a woman with several bags and after she finished getting herself settled I asked if she'd like a granny cart. She lit up and said that would sure help..."what color is it?". I told her it was black. She angrily waved me off and said she only wanted a white one. I was somewhat offended if I'm being honest as I was offering her something that I actually used on a regular basis but was willing to part with for her betterment. Moral is, I'm glad I asked first!
10npu42,j6egc8s,,heart of gold post you made there, good job.  find him a work mans winter suit, these [https://www.dickies.com/coveralls/duck-insulated-coveralls/TV239BD++M++S.html?cm\_mmc=google-\_-PLA-\_-men-coveralls-\_-TV239&cm\_mmc=google-\_-PLA-\_-Men-Coveralls-\_-null&gclid=Cj0KCQiAz9ieBhCIARIsACB0oGJL4pEfbi2WGdb3RmlUfflBHHNGdQMeSpMpQglhYkwkj9pnl1PS\_ocaAjx3EALw\_wcB](https://www.dickies.com/coveralls/duck-insulated-coveralls/TV239BD++M++S.html?cm_mmc=google-_-PLA-_-men-coveralls-_-TV239&cm_mmc=google-_-PLA-_-Men-Coveralls-_-null&gclid=Cj0KCQiAz9ieBhCIARIsACB0oGJL4pEfbi2WGdb3RmlUfflBHHNGdQMeSpMpQglhYkwkj9pnl1PS_ocaAjx3EALw_wcB)  a cart would help too. perhaps try the goodwill for a carry on luggage mini bag with wheels. my freind i stayed with this and last month found a wheeled carry on for 3 dollars. id check there also for the winter suit.
10npfby,j6ays8v,,See, this is where things get confusing. You posted a few months ago in a gofundme and on off my chest about how your daughter's husband committed suicide. Now how the fuck do you, at the age of 33, have a daughter old enough to be married (and frankly, how the fuck did you support this huge family without a driver's license). Somethings fishy here.
10npfby,,j6bgjov,He also claims to be 33, and in another post says he has 14 years of experience as a timeshare lawyer. You'd think someone who passed the bar at 19 would be able to manage his money well enough to avoid being homeless.
10npfby,,j6bl6yu,OP's life is more complex than any of us could ever comprehend.
10npfby,,j6ivajm,I didn't think pple would post a fib. He's probably sincerely in need.   Quite the mess that's why some chose the attachment free life. I'd park the truck at a hospital and stay there for some help. I'm not saying anything unkibd like he needs help.  psych wards are places for mental exhaustion it's ok to be there for a month or two. It's a clear path to case mgmt and housing. It's a bed, three meals and a shower, respite care so to speak.
10npfby,,j6bojpx,I'm a timeshare contract auditor.. not a lawyer. And I've been in the company that was ran by my wife's dad since I was a young one, and my daughter husband did kill himself, she is my step daughter.. I don't understand where you going with this, but thanks for your words of wisdom when shit hits the fan.
10npfby,,j6bq28o,You said in another post that you were a timeshare lawyer, not a contract auditor. So you either lied here or you lied there.   You also said you were in the military, that you ran a head shop, that you're a video editor ... and probably a few other things, but I stopped reading.   There are so many holes in your story. Why can't you have large amounts of cash? How did you expect to qualify to buy a house with no income and "a bunch of babies"? Why did you need to quit your job so your wife could house hunt? Nothing adds up. You're either the world's worst communicator or worst liar.
10npfby,,j6bz0hp,Idk what to tell you man, if you were in the industry for timeshare contract cancelation maybe you would know excatlly what the title are. But timeshare lawyer itself is mainly marketing for the potential client than anything, we were technically just "contract specialists" i was in the military yes, I did run a kratom and cbs business yes, and yes I had a YouTube channel, and I also edited other people videos for there channels, I took what I knew to do and tried to make money with it... I just don't get why you would legitimately go through all this trouble to try and find holes in something.. I can tell you this, I don't sit and spend fourty-Five min reading up on others I'd just give them the best advise I could for whatever situation they are in... my past income, and skills have nothing to do with the current situation that I'm in at all.
10npfby,,j6b3ymp,Busted
10npfby,,j6br5cn,Username checks out
10npfby,,j6dth7r,If he's only 33 and his daughter is married I wanna call the cops on her supposed husband.
10npfby,,j6c0x7i,She is my step daughter... why do I need to go into so much detail with you all? Just give the dang advise man.. I'm not trying to sit here and fight with someone who obviously don't have anything positive to say.
10npfby,j6acubh,,Where are the babies?
10npfby,,j6b80su,My exact thought after I finished reading this thing.
10npfby,,j6c105w,She took them with her.
10npfby,j6bg3so,,Just curious ad probably a little naive. Why do people lie on this forum? What's the point? Most people here are homeless or recovering from homelessness, so it's not like they're going to get any money out of anyone here. What do they want? Sympathy? Is it fun to see if they can get people to feel sorry for them? I don't get it ...
10npfby,,j6bq6gn,Why would I lie about this? I sit alone here until the first, then I'm in my truck with no license, I was simply asking for advice, not for you to try and determine if the story is true or not detective.
10npfby,,j6bqwqh,I don't care what lies you tell. It's just that most of the people on this forum are in worse situations than you claim to be, and I'd rather they not be scammed.
10npfby,,j6bzhye,How is any of this a scam??? I'm here to try and get feedback to my situation... idk wtf to tell you kid. I'm not saying others aren't in a bad situation.. I'm just saying I am in a situation, and what should I do... I don't understand what your reading that causes you to assume I'm lying about this, I wish I was, but on the first ill be out of here, ill be in my truck, and ill have to get on my feet, just trying to get advice man... maybe I should have spent three hours writing the full situation out? But I wasn't trying to make a book, just put the situation out there and requested feedback.
10npfby,j6apbht,,I assume you‚Äôre employed if you had kids. Just rough it in the truck for a couple weeks til you‚Äôve got bond money then start over.
10npfby,,j6bomvj,Yeah, its not the money I'm really worried about honestly, just wanted to vent and get it off my chest really..
10npfby,j6ahc18,,I would keep the truck to get to work.
10npfby,j6bcs3m,,This seems very suspect. Too many red flags.
10npfby,j6bldkb,,A suprise house huh?
10npfby,,j6bpl0p,Yup, she wanted to go look and get the home, has family in the area, basically moved into a home on my dime.
10npfby,,j6bvm1u,Was this before or after you pushed your cancer ridden mother down on the floor?
10npfby,,j6bz8jj,That was when I was a kid... anything constructive? Or any feedback for the situation at hand would be much more appreciative than whatever you call this remark.
10npfby,j6b0nou,,I‚Äôve never heard a person call his kids a bunch of babies.
10npfby,,j6b86ia,Probably because most of the thing is invented.
10npfby,,j6bs4i9,I'll send you pics just dm me asshole.
10npfby,,j6bs3ed,Because they are my babies... fucking weird ass dude.
10npfby,,j787cql,Your babies are indeed your babies, brother. This is what affectionate people say
10npfby,j6bcm4k,,Compulsive liar.
10npfby,,j6bcx0s,And not a good one. There are holes in his story that you could drive a semi through.
10npfby,,j6bkpbz,I read his other posts too. A real piece of work
10npfby,,j6boxgs,How though? My daughters husband killed himself, we were in the process of selling the home, we relocated while looking for another one, and she took the money and ran... nothing really hard to grasp there buddy boi. I am a timeshare cancelation specialist with a company that my wife's dad ran for the last 16 years.. I'm legitimately confused as to what excatly is wrong with any of my posts as you say.
10npfby,,j6bqjj0,Why did you have to quit your job so your wife could house hunt? I've known couples with three or four kids who managed to juggle jobs, home life and house hunting, all at the same time.
10npfby,,j6c029w,It was all an excuse obviously... wasn't my decision.
10npfby,,j6e3nfb,You're a 33-year-old man. You say you've been in the military, and that you have multiple years of experience in several industries. You have kids. And you say that quitting your job wasn't your decision? You can't stand up for yourself?
10npfby,,j6e52o0,Bro... I just need some advise man... I'm already in my head about everything as it is.
10npfby,,j6e9ka2,I never said I have multiple years of experience in many fields, I just try and create something out of what I know is all, just like with any business out there, I research, learn, grow, and try and pitch it to sell.. and tbh it was a pretty controlling relationship, she really wore the jeans and let it be known that I had everything because of her dad, etc etc.. so idk man, I guess I could say, no, I couldn't really stand up for myself since it wasn't my decisions to make..  her and her dad has most likely had this planed for a min.
10npfby,,j6f1fu3,It does sound like you had everything because of her dad. Maybe this is your chance to grow up and learn to take care of yourself.  You should also go back and read some of your past posts. According to you, you've been in the military, you've been a timeshare attorney, a video editor, you've been in marketing (want to focus on digital marketing), website development and a couple of other industries. I've worked in marketing and content development for more than 20 years. It's almost impossible to break into those fields without a college degree. If you really want to make it in those fields, stop bouncing around and focus. Now.
10npfby,,j6falc5,When it comes to sales, and closing deals on the contract bud, thats all on me. But I'm not going to argue with you man. I don't need to read any past post, because I know my past lmao.
10npfby,,j6boqcp,How so?? I'm confused? I'm literally here for advise as to what I do in my situation... my past posts have nothing to do with this either?..
10npfby,,j6fz4th,Because we can see all your previous posts. Too bad I can‚Äôt post pictures.
10npfby,,j6g2wxf,Wtf about them though? What does my past have to do with the current situation bud?
10npfby,,j6g30zw,spending way to much time reading into something that there is no need to look into. Either give advise or move along little man.
10npfby,,j6g7k1v,How does a 33 year old have a daughter and husband? You start fucking at 11?
10npfby,,j6gahyi,And yes it is possible for her to be my blood she is 19 years old I would have to be 13 conception and 14 birth around about, but she is my step daughter, I've raised here since she was little kid. And her husband was my best friend even though he had issues, but me and him were the only guys around, and when he killed himself everything in our lives has kind of falling apart.. he died on a Friday, and the house we sold closed and we were out that following monday. Got the airbnb while we waited to find a place, and she bailed man.. just needed advise is all, don't need you trying to scream liar, or whatever this crap is, just thought I'd put the situation out there with not to much detail, and see if anyone had any advice on services, assistance, what they would do, what they think I should do... I mean damn bro, I got until the first here, don't know wtf to do and you all are just being straight up weird.
10npfby,,j788bgq,I think the problem is you give details people don‚Äôt or won‚Äôt understand.  I think we all do this, especially when we really need help, and are so traumatized we don‚Äôt know which details matter  The irony is that if you leave some details out (lie by omission), then people wouldn‚Äôt call you a liar.   You may be too traumatized to be able to share this with a judge mental audience. (I‚Äôm sort of experiencing the same things tbh. I have to leave things out so people believe me ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt always know what to leave out eek)  Are you able to get Medicaid so you can see a therapist trained in trauma? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd recommend.  If youre at 0 or near zero, call Medicaid and tell them on the PHONE. They should approve you immediately. Do it before the pandemic status wears off. It‚Äôs easier now but it won‚Äôt be in a couple months  Just do this then get a psych. My plan allows me unlimited mental health benefits, far better than paid insurance, but unfortunately most psychs in my area are busy. On lots of waitlists. Hopefully your area will be different
10npfby,,j6g9kwb,Step buddy... I don't go around saying step daughter everywhere though.
10npfby,j6bg6v7,,Seriously there are so many things in this story that screams fake to me...
10npfby,,j6bq17m,I typed fast, honestly just wanted to post on here to vent, since I don't have anyone to talk to you know? Not trying to piss everyone off.. I just don't understand what the issue is, im asking for advice, not a fucking interrogation.
10npfby,j6bl5lu,,Mods ban him.
10npfby,,j6bq1sp,Why tho?
10npfby,,j736qau,You‚Äôre lying about something
10npfby,j6aq38x,,Well here's the deal, you're married, so I would expect to pay child support at a minimum, but likely spousal support. I basically went through a very similar situation in March 2022. A little different as we had made agreements as too the logistics of our divorce which she then threw away because I had the audacity to enforce my boundaries.   After I few days I was able to sit down and take a hard look at my financials and realize that if I wanted to afford therapy and some medical care of been putting off, I couldn't afford housing and the expected support order. And payoff the debt from the marriage. Decided a career change was in order.   Found a company that would house me during CDL training, then I could live in the truck while working. Been doing that since May, I'm getting a significant pay raise starting this Monday (500+ a week) which will accelerate my debt payoff. I HIGHLY recommend this profession to anyone physicality able enough to pass a DOT physical (not overly difficult unless you have untreated hypertension) and drug test.
10npfby,,j6bp550,Nice, I'll Def look into this.
10npfby,j6ayznc,,Do you have a job? Did your wife close on the house, and whose name is it in? Where are the kids? How long can you stay at the AirBnB?  Sorry for all the questions. Just trying to put the pieces together.
10npfby,,j6azwou,Two more: Why do you have a license permit at 33? Laws may vary from state to state, but in Texas you don't get a permit after age 18 unless you or the state think you need more time to learn to drive. And if you don't have a license, how did you get a truck and insurance?
10npfby,,j6brcbv,I haven't had a license since I was 19 lol. Just didn't ever need one, she would get up at the same time as me, and she would drive us to work, id drive if she didn't want to drive on my permit.. and the insurance is in her name, but the truck is in my name. The license issue isn't even really the concern though you know ? I mean I could just park in front of the license place and take the test on test day or whatever, mainly wanted advice on the actual situation on what I should, could or what you would do.
10npfby,,j6dvdzy,You can put a car in your name without a driver's ID? That's a new one to me.
10npfby,,j6e5yxe,Yeah.. its the insurance that requires it im sure.
10npfby,,j6iuefo,Makes sense.
10npfby,,j6e33mh,You haven‚Äôt had a driver‚Äôs license since you were 19? Seriously?
10npfby,,j6e5aja,Like I said, I have had no need for one until now.. seriously..
10npfby,,j6azgr7,I had a job, I sold the home i bought, but I have vmceryain legal issues where I can't have a large sum of money, we didn't know how long it would take to close on the house, so we put it all in her account (were not married sry been calling her my wife forever) and she was going out to look at homes, while I stayed with the babies, I quit the job we got an air bnb two hours away from original location, she threw me a bone with 409$ and I have this place till the 1st which is my birthday
10npfby,,j6b06ic,What kind of legal issues prevent you from having a large sum of money? And why did you quit your job? Did your wife work, too?
10npfby,,j6bfj9h,Which job did you quit? The head shop? Consumer advocate? Timeshare lawyer? Video editor?
10npfby,,j6bpfxt,I ran a cbd and Kratom store online while I worked as a timeshare contract specialist, and I edited YouTube videos to make more income.. its all about the income man, idk where you been at, a person can absolutely do more than one single job.. auditor, cancelation expert, there's many names for it.. I don't understand the question though, so enlighten me a little please.
10npfby,,j6bqr35,You said you quit your job. Which one? Do you still have any of them? Did you wife work? And why can't you have large amounts of cash? (You're not going to answer that, are you?)
10npfby,,j6bzwhx,Exs dads timeshare cancelation company, the only one that brought in the big Benjamins. The cbd and kratom business hasn't been around for a good min, and the video editing, and YouTube content was never a business is was a side hussle for extra income.. and the large sum of cash has mainly to do with tax debt than anything else.. so idk man, if you got something actual constructive that would be great, if not have a good day buddy boy.
10npfby,,j6bqysi,Because we moved from the state to relocate hours away, I have a income still, just not going to be as much by any means since I'm not able to work with her father anymore. The idea was we move away and buy a house here I get employed close by, and by the time the house closes we would be set, I do have a bunch of prospect in the general area, but the pay isn't what I'm looking for. The money isn't the issue, I can make money, just don't know the laws as much when it comes to the truck, no license, I could loss it etc, just wanted to see if anyone could give feedback as to what I could, should or what they would do. My skills are pretty wide when it comes to computers, editing, welding, and consulting with individuals over contract terms & payments etc.. I was venting mainly, and getting advise man.
10npfby,j6eu088,,If you want real advice hmu I can actually help you
10npfby,j6eyvbm,,hang in there OP, i'm going thru some shit too. It's okay to be sad, don't think about suicide cause that won't solve anything (one of my best friend killed himself when we were 18) and what that did to me and made me feel.... I could never do that to anyone. Just keep going, focus on building back up 1 thing at a time.
10npfby,j6a3hh1,,This is why you dont get married and put your entire faith in one person. Join the club, i am sure more sober folks on here are going to give you some advise. Its all gonna be okay
10npfby,,j6bp1an,Thanks, some of the responses here i can tell why they are in a bad situation lmao. I came here for advise and to vent, not to be questioned about my story lmfao.
10npfby,j6ax01o,,I'm in the same boat as you friend. Wife of 6 years, just up and decide she doesn't love me anymore and our marriage is irretrievably broken.  I begged if there was anything that I could do to change. She just told me that I'm a really sweet man she just don't love me like she used to. She's not in love with me. Makes me wonder if somebody else is on her mind.  I have nowhere to go, and I lost my mom when she was 44 on the 27th of January 2019. I say this because not even 4 years in a day later my wife is leaving me.  I lost my mom. I don't have any family, and I'm going to be homeless.  I was homeless once before and it sucked, but I survived. I know how hard it is, and I don't want to go back. I'm trying everything to get back on my feet but God have mercy on my poor soul.  Brother you're not alone, don't ever feel like your pain is isolated. It's not. Things just happened man, and we're just left to our own devices. If I could go back in time I would change so many things but I know I'm not the only person that thinks that way.  Just know that in 5 years maybe it'll all be better than what it is now
10npfby,,j6brxls,Bro, thats tough man... and its crazy how calm they are too lol like it doesn't mean anything and your the crazy one because your begging or tripping, and asking why, or what you can do to change etc etc... its rough man, the biggest thing right now is the quietness.. I'm use to all the babies around everywhere. The whole "i love you dad" randomly and the love the kids give you after work, or when you walk through the door is the biggest thing.. the relationship hurts alot that she would do this, but the kiddos man.. they are my fucking world brother. Thanks for the kind words, sucks to hear your going through all of that, and I hate to say it but it does make it feel better knowing others are in there head about the same thing. I pace this place right now back and forth mostly looking out the window expecting to see them, to no avail. The heartlessness responses are rough too. Like you know me, you know who I am, you know the pain I've been through and you do this and expect me to just be like, ok have a good lif.e kids, have a good life babe.
10npfby,,j6jdtol,>. She just told me that I'm a really sweet man she just don't love me like she used to. She's not in love with me  Interesting how they have the ability to just fall outta love like that, isn't it? Fucking hoes
10npfby,j6ai1r3,,Never fully trust a woman
10npfby,,j6al2an,Or anyone for that matter.
10npfby,,j6axio3,You don't know how right you are or maybe you do.  I try to tell myself not all women are like that though
10npfby,,j6angu4,Unfortunately you‚Äôre right!
10npfby,j6e2f0w,,You said it yourself, you‚Äôve already done this before. So you got this. It is a little difficult to believe that she left you out of nowhere without reason, and as she isn‚Äôt here to validate your story I‚Äôm not going to badmouth her. But you can do this.
10npfby,,j6e2uw0,People here are calling you out for being a compulsive liar. That‚Äôs not cool though.
10npfby,,j6e5rbp,Thank you so much for the kind words, and I don't understand where they got any of that at all. Past post or not, the situation at hand is what I'm dealing with.. titles in a business don't matter, look up timeshare lawyers, and you will see hundreds of companies, and most aren't lawyers. They are advocate, or consultants or contract specialists. But it is what it is I guess, this is however reddit, where your dreams and advice searching goes to die üòÖ
10npfby,,j6e7ybp,I was taught to look it it like this. If you‚Äôre lying to us all, that‚Äôs on you. It says more about you as a person than it does about my conscience, and if that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôll sleep fine at night either way. If you‚Äôre NOT lying on the other hand, then I empathize with your situation and I wish you luck. That being said I‚Äôd still like to hear her side of the story.
10npfby,,j6ea0v3,Thanks for the kind words.. any advise as to what you would do though? Like is there services out there that can help you think? Ot is it pretty much like it was years ago, single men don't really get any assistance?
10nh2d4,j68zv9v,,Forget the past, forget the people that used you, don't hold any anger towards them, they're not worth your time. All that is done, that relationship is done. You're lucky that poison is no longer in your life.   Try to keep moving. I find depression to be like rust. The longer you stay still, the thicker it globs on you. Keep doing things, keep working or posting or whatever you need to fill your time.  Keep posting,  know that people here and all over reddit have pretty shitty things done to them too.

I hope for your sake you‚Äôre able to take the advice I read someone else offer here about just putting it behind you.  Not easy to do now for sure, but there‚Äôs just not much good in hanging on to what‚Äôs going to weigh you down.

Reach out for help. It‚Äôs okay to ask. You‚Äôre not a failure. It sounds like you have a really good heart and you like to help people. You‚Äôre a good person and things will be okay. Try to focus on the present and moving forward, like you said cutting those people out of your life and starting a new. You‚Äôve got this üñ§

10nb93y,j68d2yo,,Beautiful.
10nb93y,j68zdf9,,It is my belief that what you said you changed is the actual reason why 12 Step programs like AA help a lot of people. It gives hope to others and ourselves. Its not the spirituality or anything else. It is people helping each other get better. It is holding onto each others bootstraps.                I have horrible PTSD and this is inspiring to me. Homelessness made me bitter and so mistrusting, perhaps I need to help others just to help them. The worst fear and sense of desperation I have is that I won't ever be able to connect with people again the way I did before homelessness.  The selfishness during Covid kinda cemented that I was right in the feelings homelessness inspired. Half the country supported a President that made fun of disabled people in his campaign and refused to wear a cloth on their face to help protect fellow human beings while simultaneously waiting flags and proclaiming their Patriot towards the country and support of troops. Patriotic people join the military and pledge to give their lives (albeit mostly for bullshit propaganda) but a cloth mask was too much inconvenience.  I don't think I can get over much of the past 10 years.                   You have restored a little faith in my humanity.
10nb93y,,j6a4t79,100%  Being of service to others is one of the best things you can do for your mental wellness
10nb93y,j6dfm8y,,Why would you get upset that a complete stranger chose not to "help" (give you a handout) you?
10nb93y,j691vz1,,I‚Äôm always wary of strangers especially at places like Walmart. Too many times I‚Äôve had people try to steal my credit card info under the guise of a magazine campaign.  Lot of people will make the assumption that anyone trying to ask about something not the weather is trying to scam them
10nb93y,j6ajil9,,Yours is a refreshing and excellent perspective.  If you don't mind responding, what has kept you homeless?
10nb93y,j6ak6l6,,That's great, man. I still stand by the fact that most people would watch others die for a little bit of money, but I still try to be a good person, regardless.
10nb35z,j6835gx,,I generally don‚Äôt understand gibberish.
10nb35z,j6a6kzz,,Wait, let me get this straight. You were going to sell photos of yourself (nude?) to someone, but you didn't get the money first? That sucks. But next time, if you choose to do it again, you know. Get the money upfront, always.
10nb35z,j687ape,,You shouldn't be selling nude photos of yourself.
10nb35z,,j6frhcx,You‚Äôre being an asshole. Sex work is work. She shouldn‚Äôt be stolen from.
10nb35z,,j687x9u,why? People are mad when i beg.  when i want yo give someone what he wanted for money he proposed i am somehow even worst.  he stole from me and that's all it matters using my hopes to left the streets for good.  FUCK MY LIFE.
10nb35z,,j6889g0,You're not supposed to be begging either.  If someone wants to genuinely help you, then let them help you.  But you shouldn't be exploiting yourself. There are enough people in the world that do that already.
10nb35z,,j68wue8,There's no way to make money without exploiting yourself. Every job is an exchange of yourself for money and is exploitation.  So what if someone wants to sell pictures of themselves? Big fucking deal. If they can actually get some money for the pictures, I'd say that's pretty impressive. I can't inagine that anyone actually pays for nude photos, though, do they (PM me if you do)? I mean, the entire internet is full of more free nude photos than anyone could ever look at.
10nb35z,,j68x547,I see he found a buyer.
10nb35z,,j690nk2,I thought this post was saying the buyer didn't pay, though, right? Or do you mean he found another buyer?  Hey, whoever is buying nude photos of homeless men, contact me now. I bet my dick is bigger than /u/less_preparation_428's. If not, I'll knock 20% off the price of the photos.

10nb35z,,j6pbfjj,Lol it's funny you don't realize you're a fucking idiot too
10nb35z,,j6kte04,So let me get this straight. Your clearly homeless by your own choice judging by your post history but you still post shit about how sick you are setting up camp to garner sympathy, you see a post about a homeless individual you know nothing about being taken advantage of sexually as is a common occurrence in homelessness and especially online. So instead of either being supportive and or helpful of someone who is clearly having a hard go of it, you decide to pop up with some toxic bullshit to show the rest of the world what skid mark you are on the underpants of society.  Good job dumbass üëè

10n2o86,j68v6fv,,I haven't been to a food pantry in a while, but the one I used to go to always had really good bread. It was mostly day old stuff (week old, I'm sure, but still not actually stale) from the local Whole Foods and Trader Joe's stores. They got tons of it in and you could take as much as you wanted. All kinds of awesome country style loaves of sourdough and rye and multigrain stuff. That pantry also always had real peanut butter. The kind without sugar and hydrogenated oil added. I can't hardly even find that stuff for sale anymore at regular markets it seems like.
10n11u1,j66qyk7,,I hope things get better for you.sorry you got ditched.i hope you can relax and get some rest.be safe.im rooting for you.
10n11u1,,j6885bv,Thank you so much. I truly appreciate it. I'm definitely trying to relax a bit. I'm just lost at the moment.
10n11u1,j676vkt,,If all that other advice fails, start walking towards your dads
10n11u1,,j6883pl,I am sorry I didn't get back to the comments last night, I can only use my phone on wifi. I have seriously thought about that. Just walking that way. It's a long way but I think I can do it.
10n11u1,,j688em3,Yes you can. Water. Instant mashed potatoes are cheap. Rest every 8 miles and lay on your back and elevate your feet for 10-15 minutes to let your feet and legs rest. When it comes time to sleep dip deep down in the woods somewhere you don‚Äôt see any homeless trash or human evidence. Move in the daylight and you should be good. Good luck
10n11u1,j66y36d,,Contact a church or social services.You have a place to go to.Should be able to get a bus ticket.They can call your Dad to verify.
10n11u1,,j6888sl,They do that? That would be absolutely amazing! Is it all churches? I have to contact them today and see if I can get a bus ticket! Thank you!
10n11u1,,j6920ab,Maybe not all churches but in my experience if they don‚Äôt have a particular service they call people that can help. Just by reaching out at all gets you a hell of a lot of an easier time
10n11u1,,j6almr3,Try the Saint Vincent de Paul Society near where you are. They helped me out tremendously when I was homeless, with no car , no family left , with my dog and the clothes on my back.  They paid for me to have a motel room for 3 days, and a train ticket to safety after they verified it. They have an answering machine for when they aren't in the office, so if you get that, make sure to leave a message, they will call you back.  They're all over the US, it's part of Catholic Charities, and you don't have to be Catholic to get help. They also paid for my heart medications and gave me a 25 dollar Publix card to get food while in the motel. I'm not even religious, but I can't say enough good things about them, at least in the 2 states I've had to use them until I could get back on my feet and find a way out of being homeless. I am disabled and at the time, was in a partial body cast from major spine surgery. We had lost the house after my mom died suddenly because they wouldn't work with us on adjusting the payment like 50 bucks temporarily until we could catch up.  Fuck Bank of America with a cactus lol.  Best of luck to you, you can do this!
10n11u1,j67137x,,So, I have to ask a few questions first.  1. Do you know where you are? 2. How long have you been out there for? 3. How are you on supplies (food, water, medicine, et)? 4. What are the conditions of the environment you're in? 5. Do you have any way to protect yourself? 6. What's your main survival concern right now? 7. Do you have any materials to make a signal for a rescue team?  Ultimately, I think you should call 911. If that doesn't work, try calling your local Fish and Game or Forest Service. You need someone to come out there to rescue you. I wouldn't recommend hitchhiking at all. You need a rescue team or search party to get you out of there. Explain how you have no way out, and that you're running low on supplies.  In the meantime, I would stay put. Try not to burn too many calories, and save power on your phone (if you have no way to charge it). You can make a distress signal by making a few campfires in a triangle, and throwing grass on them. Some more methods for creating distress signals can be found here. [https://www.primalsurvivor.net/distress-signal/](https://www.primalsurvivor.net/distress-signal/)  EDIT:  Reread the post, my bad for the slight misunderstanding. You should still seek help from whoever manages the land that you're on. Fish and Game or the Forest Service isn't going to care about your housing status, they're going to care about your safety. If you're still concerned about them being biased towards homeless people, leave it out (if you can pass as a housed individual, or say that your appearance is due to being stranded for too long). Whatever option makes you feel safer, just tell it how it is. Inform them that you were abandoned by your husband, have no way to leave, and that you fear for your safety. I'm saying this as someone who has family who worked in wildlife and fisheries. I would honestly be surprised if they didn't help you at least get somewhere safer.
10n11u1,,j673ria,But they aren't stranded in the wilderness and in need of search and rescue. She said there are shady people around so it's probably a homeless encampment.
10n11u1,,j67itkn,Regardless, she should still call 911, Fish and Game, or the Forest Service. They most likely aren't going to care about her being homeless, they're going to see it as a survival situation. Whether OP's homeless or not. Their imperative is to ensure her survival and safety by getting her out of there. Abandoned is stranded, and it doesn't matter if its in a remote area, or a popular campground; it's ultimately the concern of whoever's in charge of the area. Nobody wants the land they're managing to be the place where someone got hurt or died. Whether it's by sketchy people or otherwise. That's terrible for everyone (especially for those working there).   I'm saying this as someone whose father worked in wildlife and fisheries. They're usually pretty understanding of people's situation, and it's common for them to help people out. As there's emergency situations that happen all the time in the outdoors. They might even be able to drive her to wherever she needs to go. I'd say it's OP's best bet. This probably isn't even the first time they've had to help someone who was abandoned in the woods.
10n11u1,,j688m6b,Thank you for this information. I'm willing to try whatever I can at this point. I'm not actually in an encampment, I'm in woods that used to be a homeless encampment, but everyone abandoned these woods so I am back there by myself. I think that's why I'm afraid is that I'm alone out there and others have seen me going in and out by myself. I'm going through the comments today and hopefully I can find a way to my dad's, people have suggested things I didn't know or hadn't even thought of. I think I have brain fog from the stress and fear of being alone on the street so I'm not thinking straight. I will keep this in mind if I cannot find another way! Thank you so much
10n11u1,j67paqh,,If i were you i'd concentrate all my efforts on somehow getting the money to afford that bus ticket, move in with your father and help him if he is disabled, find a job, any job for starters, minimum wage, anything. you probably won't even have to pay rent but you have a chance to take care of your father and be a good daughter, and you'd be helping yourself too. I know it's easier said than done but it *can* be done and it's the closest thing to a long term plan you could have, and what's the alternative? To waste your life on living in a forest? Go, do your best, try to make some money for that ticket, in a moral/legal way ofcourse. And stay away from your husband, he obviously doesn't love you if he left you all alone in a forest, you'll find true love someday, but not if you give up. You can do this, now go.
10n11u1,j69asvs,,Can‚Äôt your dad cover the cost of a taxi?  That can be arranged through the taxi office.  That‚Äôs your best option I. M. O.

10n11u1,j684sap,,How far is it to your dad's house?
10n11u1,j68gt1f,,It can be done. First see if there is a mission by you. It‚Äôs supper religious but they can get you a bus ticket to your dads. Second f your husband Make him an ex. What he did is wrong. Get yourself to civilization and call 2-1-1 for help. Go to a church and tell them you want to work for a bus ticket many will have you just do a days work and get you an amtrack or greyhound ticket. Use the local food pantry to find out what churches can help. You‚Äôre not alone and they don‚Äôt pay taxes so that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt to help you.
10n11u1,j6aedky,,Call back the shelters and ask them if they would pay for your transportation to your dads.
10n11u1,j6e89k6,,First of all call 211  Second call up Dad or any relatives and see if they can send you a bus ticket  Post locally om FB to see if anyone can donate a bus ticket and or if they have any work you can do to earn the money  Call around to any churches and homeless outreach in your area and ask for a bus ticket. Is there a St Vincent Depaul near you? If there is a circle K along the way ask if they will let you have a polar pop they are huge drinks for $1 or maybe someone there will buy you one. You can also ask a female if they are headed into the direction you are going and ask for a ride.   Your husband is an asshole. This is a hard lesson not to depend on anyone to take care of you. You need to eventually get a job and an income..your Dad being disabled and limited income is not going to be able to support you. Map out a plan to get out of this situation.
10n11u1,j6hm07e,,I'm so sorry üòû
10n11u1,j69fw8e,,Try to call 311, they may have resources for you. Also, what he did is abusive, and that will also open doors in terms of resources. But yeah. Call 311.

10n0pnf,,j66fjwq,Np, keep all your belongings within arms reach or have line of sight to them. Your phone is in your hand or in your pocket. Get comfortable saying "Nope, sorry" when asked for stuff. Grab some earplugs for sleep if you can (reuseables are best). Don't lend money to anyone, even small change.   And overall, be nice. Don't be an a-hole. They'll gang up on you or look to steal your gear otherwise. Stay safe, take care.

If you are in a car (which I would imagine you'd be sleeping in) don't give anyone rides. Always be "on your way to an appointment" when you're leaving. The ride is always to "a bus stop over by (somewhere close)" and when they're in your car, suddenly the destination changes and it's across the next town over.  Be safe.

10n0pnf,,j69k2e5,Nine people swarmed me for smokes this morning.   I always tell them I chose this addiction and they chose theirs. Shuts them up.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it though.
10n0pnf,,j69surg,If I didn't just outright lie about it being my last one, I'd remind them that we're in the parking lot of a homeless shelter and I'm broke, so I can't afford to be the free cigarette guy.  Shit, wave a dollar at me or something.
10n0pnf,,j6anrpa,That's what I always say: "it's my last one, sry"
10n0pnf,j69kgz7,,The important stuffs been covered so I‚Äôll just add: pay attention. Situational awareness is important.   EG the staff may start handing out bus tickets or pop tarts or whatever without announcing it.  Watch the quiet stampede and follow even if you‚Äôre not sure why.  It‚Äôs likely no one will give you a heads up.    Every man for himself, and all that.
10mzmrq,j66x77l,,The best thing anyone can do is learn how to "stealth" camp. But, this entails not being on drugs, a drunk, and keeping up appearances! That's right! No smoking, no drinking, no drugging! Not even weed! As far as myself goes, you'd be awfully surprised on just how long I can go on just $50 bucks! I can make that last a very, very, very, long time indeed while also looking and smelling presentable!
10mzmrq,,j67p76z,No drinking ?  Why couldnt you have a few beers stealth?  Sure you can.
10mzmrq,,j68sysy,Because, drinking causes homelessness!

10mzmrq,,j68u33a,I've been an alcoholic for 13 years and have been clean for over a year now. I also quit smoking 4 months ago! Like actually quit! No vapes, no patches, no gum, no pills! Just plain cold turkey! My life is 1000% better without alcohol and/or cigarettes!  The alcohol was actually killing me and it almost got me evicted three times and there is still a lasting strain between my landlord and I! Alcohol is no good! It has also already killed three people directly that I know of who didn't even make it to 40 years old! And I didn't like being around them when they were drinking, either!
10mzmrq,,j6944kx,Bullshit. I've been "stealth camping" as you call it for years now and I smoke several joints and mix up a couple gin and juices every damned day. That's half the fun of being out here.

10mzmrq,,j66m6uq,I do agree with trying to get help there ,however there isn't many resources here in AZ either..having said that I think the North Eastern states are a bit more helpful when it comes to helping the homeless. Could be wrong bc it's been awhile.
10mzmrq,,j67v0zj,Wow, that‚Äôs awesome!  How did you transition to this?
10mzmrq,,j689ydw,Each time was a different reason..To be honest lots of praying I guess .
10mzmrq,,j6anqm8,Praying actually got you off the street and into the position to buy your own home? Wow!!  I‚Äôve been praying endlessly, morning, moon and night. Sometimes even when I sleep.   It helps sometimes, but too often for every step forward it‚Äôs a lap two steps back kind of thing.  Your prayers seem effective. Could you kindly share how you pray? Maybe some example prayers?  Thank you! üôè
10mzmrq,,j6autvw,I don't think I have an effective way of praying but a diligent way ..don't stop and don't be discouraged..We aren't meant to see everything.
10mzmrq,,j6au8ss,One thing I learned is never forget about God when things are good (it's easy to do being human ) ..Everything we have is only temporary the same goes with current situations.
10mzmrq,,j66j6a1,Im from there and have been on both ends . I don't like shelters ..I have lived in 180 place and that was the worst but outside of that not too bad.
10mzmrq,,j66ljz4,We live in our van bc of pets. But shelters are only open at night anyway. The weather is horrific. This summer past was a nightmare. The cops in our city are generally ok but will still hustle you out of the parking lot if they're called... and they will get called.
10mzmrq,,j69ef4v,I once called the cops on a "suspicious vehicle" in a parking lot across the street from my house before.  It turns out that as I was watching the cops pull up and shine their light into the windows, two people sat up really fast and it turns out that they were having sex so I felt so bad for calling the cops on suspicious vehicles and will never do it again. I'll just mind my own damned business.
10mzmrq,,j69fl35,Yeah, parking like we have to has destroyed intimacy bc of how scared I am of being called on. Last thing we need is to have to register bc we were within x many feet of a school or some stupid crap.
10mzmrq,,j69m99i,Over here, we have a bike path that goes along the river and there are sections of parking lot  where people park and spend time together just watching the water and the sunset.  I have noticed, though, since I walk 10 miles a day down this bike path, that there are occasionally people sleeping in their cars. Like 4 or 5 in a row! I understand and I never bother them.
10mzmrq,,j66luaq,I haven't lived there in a few years .  If you don't mind me asking what part of Chas are y'all in?
10mzmrq,,j66mjyd,Not in Chas. Goose Creek. I'm sure covid eliminated a lot of resources that may have existed prior. My mom worked for DSS for nearly two decades before she died, I know through her how very limited and disjointed programs are in the state.
10mzmrq,,j66muun,I can imagine what that's done all over . I lived in Summerville/ Ladson at one time ..I lived in Walmart parking lot in James island and never had a problem with getting kicked out .
10mzmrq,,j66oh67,Our mailing addy is in Ladson. My mom lived there too. But just changing our residence from Berkeley to Dorchester opened opportunities. Berkeley is a large county but NIMBY af. I've lived in GC all but 2 years of my 38. We hang around here bc of our storage unit situation and the cops. We were told by BCSO to park at the GC walmart and had been for the vast majority of this time but, ultimately, one call and you can get a tresspass or just shuffled along. We hadn't even been there the day it happened but an RV was boondocking for a couple weeks and our vehicle just got tagged in a handful of repeat visitors that got the same nonsense.   I hear there is less homeless near Mt P and that they don't get harassed as much. N Chs has a camp behind Rivers Walmart and Ladson has one around CVS but the cops dont actively sweep either, they just have a heavy presence. Still, I'd rather have to talk to our cops over others bc of how disproportionate their reactions can be.
10mzmrq,,j66pk9b,Wow yea I hear that . I hated Ladson it was one streak of bad luck after another, which still lays in old news to this day . Well hope you guys the best . I've advocated for people there and here and it's exhausting with no real help from state..donations are rare and to top it I work in rich people's homes like why do you need a house this size .

10mzmrq,,j67fzem,What's happening?
10mzmrq,j6782ez,,There is no ‚Äúgood‚Äù place to be homeless.
10mzmrq,,j79prm3,You ain't kidding!
10mzmrq,j66no70,,I'd say long Island new York or Vermont. Both have amaz8ng resources to help get you back on your feet
10mzmrq,j67z3fk,,Colorado
10mzmrq,j663r8z,,Utah or Colorado maybe!!!!!
10mzmrq,,j66b8t5,Definitely Utah. They have so many resources to get you into an apartment, job, etc and even public transportation help. The public transit is so nice and runs every 15-30 minutes (depending on the area/line) either bus or train, all over the valley from South Salt Lake to Ogden. The shelters are really nice, too. Lots of places to get free meals as well.
10mzmrq,,j66iwzg,I've always been nervous about Utah because I'd HATE to have some fundamentalists try to force their religion down my throat. They tried that when I was homeless in Nashville and visited the food bank. Those fuckers wanted me to pray first. They can kiss my ass.
10mzmrq,,j66jlpv,It's definitely not like that anymore. Downtown is super chill and so many people have moved in that it's quite diversified. The only problem I had was State owned liquor stores, 1 shot at a time in a bar, and they use these weird clicker things that count the ounces in the computer so there is no overpour. Liquor laws are wild ü§£ But you can tell there is no separation of church and state on a lot of things.
10mzmrq,,j66wbww,If only you had seen what alcohol did to myself! It also killed three close acquaintances and they were a six pack after work type, though the one also drank Fireball whiskey. I am so, incredibly glad, that I stopped!
10mzmrq,,j6gfrlc,Ugh, fireball whiskey-dang.  I‚Äôve experienced similar in life‚Ä¶I‚Äôve never done anything other than drink alcohol, but quitting was by far the best thing I had done!  For sure.  It was the best decision for me and definitely saves money.  It‚Äôs liberating too, not having something with that kind of grip on you.  I feel the same about other, albeit less troubling, products as well.  Energy drinks Sodas Pretty much anything that‚Äôs touted as healthy, but actually isn‚Äôt regulated by the FDA nor provide significant nutrition or might flood your body with unhealthy levels of (such as antioxidants).  I enjoy my water, coffee and if I‚Äôm lucky chocolate milk.  Better to keep it simple.
10mzmrq,,j6ibx8a,Glad you quit alcohol. It really is slavery! You are not kidding about those energy drinks! I've always had a healthy suspicion of those since they first came on the market. If it has more than four ingredients, it needs to be looked at with a healthy amount of suspicion!
10mzmrq,,j66kckc,And that's what sucks, too. In a lot of cities, the only recourse is to eat in one of those mission kitchens where you have to sit through a sermon first. I had to do that in Nashville, NY, and Seattle. Those were "swallow my pride" moments.
10mzmrq,,j79q8fd,It's nice having a Coleman stove and a small pot and small frying pan in my backpack. All I need is EBT! The green single burner Coleman 502, that is. Just pump it up good and cook away! No expensive bulky propane canisters and it can run on unleaded gasoline!
10mzmrq,,j67jecx,Yeah I used to live in Utah for about a year like 2-3 years ago. It's really not like that. They dont even like to be called "mormons" and younger folks do not care if youre not "of the church of latter day saints" Biggest difference I saw is that everyone uses Fry sauce instead of ketchup. Its legitimately funny how if you ask for ketchup, most times the reply you'll hear is "You're from out of town, huh?"
10mzmrq,,j67t6h6,"Fry sauce - an equal mix of ketchup and mayonnaise." New one on me.
10mzmrq,,j6bxafj,Its pretty good stuff to be honest! After a while I had to readjust to how like 'acidic' or 'sweet' ketchup was because i was just used to eating with fry sauce.
10mzmrq,,j66cyyv,Is that because of BYU and the affiliations with I think Latter Day Saints. I'm asking because it's Utah and..well, you know. More or less a religious state. I always thought that many years ago. Tax write off, helping not only the homeless, but anyone who may need it.
10mzmrq,,j66dw93,No not really.. they are less inclined to help.. a few years ago actually, they got in trouble for filling 3 Greyhound busses full of homeless and shipping them off to Vegas.  I'm sure there are some tax write offs somewhere for whatever they claim to do but the biggest help seems to be from St. Vincent's and other organizations not affiliated with the LDS. Things are definitely changing though. Especially in Salt Lake. Provo on the other hand, is the Mormon mecca... The biggest problem however, was when they shut down the biggest shelter there was out there in downtown to make room for new apartments and the money invested in "cleaning it up".  The new shelter isn't in an ideal location but it is super nice and accommodating. If you really want the help, it's there for sure. Unfortunately a lot of mental health issues and drugs are what keeps a lot of these folk on the streets.
10mzmrq,,j66ev92,I think it was in 1974, I was 14. I had a cousin who attended BYU. He lived in the apartment building next to mines in The South Bronx. He had a full ride, basketball. I remember watching him on TV playing ball. I was waiting for him to come home after the semester, don't know what happened to him. But I know he never came back to The Bronx. I remember my mother telling me that she doesn't want me going to THAT school. Never knew why either. Hey thanks for the info.
10mzmrq,,j67b8d8,Mmm. A Mormon bishop put me in a motel for 3 days and took me to buy food and shampoo and such.

10mvzmk,j675396,,If you need a place to park overnight, try Sierra College up the 80 in Rocklin. It's a community college, not a private college and they (used to?) allow overnight parking.   BTW, what are you talking about with your county ID? Are you from out of state?
10mvzmk,,j67910y,No, my ID is from a differenty county in california, (you know, like sacramento county, nevada county etc) but I was told by the homeless shelter I was trying to enter that they wouldn't accept me unless I had a placer county ID. (a drivers license with a residence in placer county such as roseville or maybe rocklin too w/e)  &#x200B;  also, I've been over there (sierra college in rocklin) and I see security patrolling the parking lots often, maybe the climate has changed? when was the last time you found it safe to park there overnight?
10mvzmk,,j68y0e7,WTF?! Shelter isn't supposed to limit access to only county residents,  it's not even supposed to limit access to US citizens. OK, give the local Lazarus Project a call (on Monday) to see what requirements are needed to access transitional housing and temporary (shelter) housing  (916) 772-6833. It SHOULD NOT be a requirement to access any shelter because they get money from the state and federal government to operate.  Ask them what your options are but I'll be damned if they say you need to get an ID with a city on it because you HAVE NO ADDRESS...THAT'S THE WHOLE GODDAMN POINT OF THE SHELTER! Uhg, I'm so sorry you have to deal with that bullshit!  All CA community colleges have, since the pandemic, been very helpful resources,  mine allows people to sleep in their cars while using their bathrooms at night. They'll ask you to leave if you use drugs/alcohol on campus or leave trash or harass other students, but otherwise it should be chill. They might be able to get you a free or very cheap parking pass. Check out their website, but you'll have to wait until Monday to call. https://www.sierracollege.edu/student-services/health-and-wellbeing/basic-needs-resources/  EDIT- yes, they help students first but it takes nothing to become a "student" there's plenty of "classes" that are free and online and don't really require much from you BUT you may want to check out classes because as of this year tuition is free if you qualify financially and you definitely would qualify, you just probably need to see a counselor but be patient and know that this is what the community College system was meant for, it is a resource for those who need help, those who want to improve their lives.   Stay strong, I know that there's been a lot of pushback against the homeless since resources have gotten scarce, but keep at it, it takes some hoop jumping and persistence, but help is out there. Just takes a while.
10mvzmk,j68yjnt,,If you don't want to get hassled, there's plenty of good places around the north side of Folsom Lake, in my experience.
10mv596,j65em5a,,Con: liability. If someone dies in a structure you built you could be on the hook civilly or criminally.  This [company](https://palletshelter.com/) does what you are talking about. Assuredly they have liability insurance. But they also follow the residential code. In particular they make sure there are two ways to escape from these small houses in case of fire - the main door and an escape hatch in the back wall. I would study the way they do things. You might even give them a call.  A number of cities now have purchased these pallet structures for temporary villages. You will probably want to investigate how these camps are permitted, what sort of infrastructure is required, that sort of thing.
10mv596,,j65f7av,Zoning laws are the sticking point.  Most empty lots are zoned for single family homes of specific square feet.  Where would the little houses be set up?
10mv596,,j663psk,Unless the structure can be mobile. But the only way you could do that is towing it with a vehicle.
10mv596,,j692nvc,OP indicated they want them on wheels.  Also how will the following work:  - Electric - Gas/heat - Plumbing - Internet - Insulation  /r/tinyhouses can help with that info. But unfortunately the main struggles will most likely be finding a place to even park the thing legally, how costs will be handled for utilities/parking, and how to handle utilities.
10mv596,,j697hz4,There‚Äôs no way I can afford that. Plus if it has heating plumbing and all that I need a permit. All of this is coming out of my pocket. It‚Äôs just going to be a small place where people can escape the rain and not be on the cold ground. Nothing special nothing unique. Just bare needs. I‚Äôm not paying thousands of dollars trying to get solar panels for a homeless person who might sell the solar panel for drugs. I‚Äôm not going to make this a luxury place because I myself do not have a luxury place. I live in a trailer I‚Äôm not getting them Internet because I myself do not have Internet, I‚Äôm not giving them gas and heat because I myself do not have gas and heat. I‚Äôm not giving them electricity because what grade are they gonna be hooked up to and how are they going to pay their electricity?
10mv596,,j66gzol,This is almost perfect. The toilet/shower needs to be in each unit. Units need to spaced farther apart from each other. No need for community shower and toilet. I'd gladly exist in one of these. Such units can't be placed anywhere in my current area. I only see extremely rare old trailer homes communities.
10mv596,,j66jd6u,Places like Los Angeles have been erecting these villages in parking lots and other open spaces. The villages are fenced for security and staff is on site 24 hours a day. The idea is this is the first step off the streets. Once there services come to the residents rather than the other way around.
10mv596,,j66qovm,nothing like that in nj. the system wants everyone on the grid, housed, $60k/year minimum income, home owner, health-insured, employed, taxed, never get old and sick.
10mv596,,j697u4e,No toilet no shower. I need a permit for that and a lot of extra money. The homeless already shower at the portable showers
10mv596,,j65intu,What if I make them sign a contract stating I am not liable for any harm this inflicts on others after it is given to them. And also get a pic in case of fake name
10mv596,,j65js4i,I don't know if such a contract would hold up. If your building does not live up to the building code in your area it might not matter if someone waived your liability or not. This would be a question for a lawyer who knows about real estate/construction.  You also might look up how much liability insurance would cost. I don't think it is too expensive.
10mv596,,j66l9jw,Agree. Some solid advice I think you and most everyone is offering OP here.  OP‚Ä¶excellent questions! Awesome that you care so much and want to help.  Might try to see if your local has a ‚Äòround table‚Äô monthly meetup and discussion on homelessness.  Could perhaps look into a recent report on homelessness‚Ä¶usually the more involved churches, shelters, organizations will be listed and that will give you contacts to ask the questions that are coming up here.  Again, thanks for caring and if your vision doesn‚Äôt turn out exactly as planned‚Ä¶remember that‚Äôs okay too, as long as you learned something and hopefully helped someone in the process.
10mv596,,j66oa07,No one cares about the homeless here. It‚Äôs in Fresno California. About an hour or two from la.
10mv596,,j66zn8y,Ah, oof‚Ä¶I see.  Pretty much just use them to make content to upload and get funds for, then claim that they make nothing on it in reality and form, spread biases?.  Well, if anything, do you due diligence and if things seem sensible to carry out this mission ya got‚Ä¶perhaps just take it slow at first, to get as many issues solved in the beginning stages as possible.  I really like the idea and have wanted to do similar, but encampments are constantly being ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù.  So I‚Äôm going about things a slightly different way now to hopefully improve things.
10mv596,,j670t20,I would first suggest taking your building proposals to city hall and get information about zoning before anything else
10mv596,,j67irsw,In‚Ä¶ cali? Aren‚Äôt they notorious for dragging that stuff out and refusing to allow new housing?
10mv596,j65kzsp,,Are you in a place where folks can pitch a tent and have it left alone by the authorities?  If so, then maybe.  If not, then no, this is just a bigger tent which authorities will target
10mv596,j65bkzn,,Some guy built tiny homes for homeless I think in LA then the city confiscated them for violating regulations. Definitely check with the city/state first
10mv596,,j675y1u,That‚Äôs exactly what I was going to mention, I‚Äôll see if I can find the article I read about him.
10mv596,j65d9om,,How much is it going to cost you?
10mv596,,j65igza,Not much I live on a pallet yard. Wood is free. I was just planning on buying the spray insulation hinges shopping cart wheels and a carpet. But I didn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs so many laws about this
10mv596,,j6936n0,Yeah housing building codes and zoning is not easy. You can build the structure but you‚Äôre gonna run into issues with insulation, handling utilities, parking a structure like that, and legal hurdles.   For instance, where will the structures be parked? Will it cost money? Are there legal or safety ramifications for having a towed home without any heat or plumbing?  Frankly in shopping cart wheels my first concern is that you can‚Äôt really tow it. Those wheels won‚Äôt survive highway roads. You‚Äôd need legit ones or you‚Äôre getting pulled over or causing an accident
10mv596,j661p5d,,Maybe ask these guys for feedback?  https://thefreethoughtproject.com/the-state/charity-built-dozens-tiny-homes-for-the-homeless-and-the-city-just-destroyed-all
10mv596,,j67ejzq,That is just about the most fucked up thing I have ever read.
10mv596,,j68i5v4,People are assholes.  I understand the fire safety aspect but otherwise....????  They have to live somewhere!  Personally, I'm rather they were housed than sleeping under a bridge somewhere.....
10mv596,,j691az5,The fire safety issue can be solved a lot more easily than the ‚Äúfreezing to death‚Äù issue.   Even from the POV of some suburban Karen, wouldn‚Äôt it be preferable to have designated encampments than thousands of people wandering the streets and sheltering anywhere?
10mv596,j66l9g5,,Who gets to choose which person gets one? Are you getting help with a non- profit? Who is going to pay the insurance and upkeep? Will there be security? What length of time can someone stay? Will there be wraparound services to transition someone to permanent housing? Many questions....
10mv596,,j66p6tp,[deleted]
10mv596,,j67rlin,How would they sell what they don‚Äôt own? You‚Äôre kidding yourself if you think there‚Äôs many homeless people out there who aren‚Äôt on anything. At least where I was, most people did something. Also you can‚Äôt pick who gets them based off who you think speaks the best. Not everyone had enough privilege to speak English as a first language of have a good background and education. I think you‚Äôll be disappointed to find the reality of homelessness
10mv596,,j696e38,I‚Äôm not selling it I‚Äôm giving it. And I know a lot of the homeless n my area personally. I hand out pizza all the time to them cuz I work at a pizza place. I also used to be homeless
10mv596,,j6bd230,Right. If you used to be homeless I‚Äôm sure you understand the kind of people around. I guarantee more than you think are on some kind of drug. And yes if you ‚Äúgive‚Äù it to them, which would mean legally you still own and are responsible for it that would cause huge problems when they are inevitably misused. Sounds like a cop magnet.   Also, the argument still stands to not pick the most privileged homeless to give homes to. Many have poor English skills but because they couldn‚Äôt get an education or speak it as a first language means they are worth less than those who have those things?
10mv596,,j6grgde,I ment ‚Äúspeak good English‚Äù by when I ask if they need anything and they respond with ‚Äúhey look an alien‚Äù or something anything Joe Biden would say. Most of the time people are on drugs they don‚Äôt form sentences and speak nonsense
10mv596,,j6k5tlk,Haha that‚Äôs not true at all. My English is fine completely stoned. So is most people‚Äôs. And reading that comment, you bypass ability to critique anyone‚Äôs English
10mv596,,j6luzah,And you misunderstand me. I‚Äôm talking about people on drugs don‚Äôt speak coherently I can guarantee it. I know what people look like and sound like. If seen it destroy close family and friends. I‚Äôm not talking about you or anyone on the platform when I say speaking coherent
10mv596,,j6mxwjt,Some don‚Äôt. Many do. Many people you wouldn‚Äôt ever know. For many it‚Äôs a permanent state. For many it‚Äôs the only source of comfort they‚Äôve ever had. Many including myself are perfectly fine at faking sobriety

10mv596,j673c5h,,Can you just do this? Build homes for homeless and have them live/stay in them? Is that legal?
10mv596,j67evhn,,The first thing i thought was disposability. I imagine a structure for that purpose would only be usable a certain amount of times before it would have to be deconstructed. That or make it easily repairable and cleanable. Something cheep, durable and easily fixable would be good. It should only be a temporary situation anyways.
10mv596,j67lmxn,,I am interested in what homeless people say. Here in LA I think the homeless need tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, clothes, showers! It is such a huge problem I don't think tiny houses will solve the problem but thank you.
10mv596,j67r7ib,,Trouble would be maintaining them from vandalism and whatnot, and watching out for illegal activity (namely drugs) because any sight of that would make you an immediate cop magnet. I‚Äôd say have a sharps disposal just in case, but if someone dies in them it would have big liability problems.   Many people would appreciate and need that but it may be hard on you, some people will likely abuse them a little. But I think it would really help many people but put yourself first here
10mv596,j6a2i1j,,Many people have tried this, spent their own money and time to make insulated simple shelters for the homeless.  Only to watch the city come and take it away.  Cities don't want the homeless to be comfortable.  They want them to go away.  It's sickening.
10mv596,j6ji0m3,,The police will always come and tear it down. NIMBYs, many of whom lurk this sub to get ideas on how to punish people they don't like, are the ones who make sure people don't get too comfortable. There's also the liability issues and ordinances regarding permanent vagrancy that have already been addressed.   What homeless really need is a means to transport what little they have. Some of the best ideas for those are things [Paul Elkins](https://youtu.be/ErhJIWtM80I) has made. His channel has several ideas for bike RVs.

10mpxmh,j64u1q8,,Our city of Niagara has three awesome contributors.    One goes around to buskers/panhandlers and drops them $40 every day.   It‚Äôs a random location.    Another comes to the shelter lineup and donates gently used clothes, boots, and 10 cigarettes per person.     The third comes every night with pizza and every morning with muffins.    Amazing.  These acts of selflessness don‚Äôt really benefit me physically, but it gives me great pleasure knowing people care.    To get back on topic, that pizza blew my mind on my first night out here. I was cold and hungry and in a very very dark place mentally until she showed up.
10mpxmh,j65bt1c,,The one meal a day I got was from a columbian place that is still around. My homeless mentor, the one who showed me the ropes, would often go to their backdoor. Chat with them in spanish because he was extremely fluent, and he'd get a meal no questions asked. Chicken, rice, and plantains. I didn't want to do the same but when I was hungry enough I did. Told them I was friends with T and could I please have something to eat. I got exactly the same and it was the best food I'd ever tasted. I only did it occasionally, when I was truly desperate, but they never asked questions or asked for money. I'm not homeless anymore and I thank them whenever I go back there for being one of the few who treated me with humanity. I imagine they were shocked a young girl would come to their door starving.
10mpxmh,,j67a3ax,Such a beautiful story!
10mpxmh,j66jjqf,,So, back when I was 16 and freshly homeless I would hang out in a Starbucks every single day. From the moment they opened to the moment they closed. This one worker came up to me with a trash bag full of pre-made meals and baked items and told me that her manager was okay with her giving me everything they had to throw out that day. I broke down crying because it was the first meal I had in nearly two weeks. I'd been surviving off of instant mashed potatoes that I added water to in a metal cup that I had and a large jar of pickles. As they closed she handed me two personalized drinks one hot and one cold and wished me luck. I really hope she's going better these days.
10mpxmh,,j67a788,It's amazing how something a small as a meal can have such an incredible impact!
10mpxmh,j65gseg,,Church people feed us ...it means a lot.
10mpxmh,j65jg42,,Just picked up some food from the salivation army, and boy am I happy just this canned food is great when your  hungry l, gave me some ready to eat to food,
10mpxmh,j65nnyc,,I recently got into a shelter with a confirmed bed. I've been having a lot of health problems, I was fired m been homeless for 6 months. Getting into shelters during winter can be hard. The first meal I had here was beef. I hadn't had meat that wasn't pepperoni in awhile
10mpxmh,,j65nssq,This is my main pls give me da Kayla lol oops
10mpxmh,j66lqs8,,When I lived in a shelter, some friends told me a church was passing out McDonalds breakfast to all the homeless. We ran there like kids, all men in our 20s/30s, and we hopped in line with the biggest smile waiting for some good food.
10mpxmh,j67bgo7,,I took a homeless man to IHOP and it was money well spent. He seemed to enjoy the ability to have someone listen to him as much as the food and coffee
10mpxmh,,j67bxr2,That's really interesting! Can I ask what motivated you to do that? It doesn't seem very common these days..
10mpxmh,,j67cc4i,Simple. He was hungry. I've taken more than one person to eat. That was just the most memorable. Well, also the couple in a waffle house that looked homeless. I told the waitress to put it on my tab. She wasn't supposed to tell them who did but she did and they were so thankful. All you have to do is ask yourself how you'd like to be treated.
10mpxmh,,j67cyaz,It's not everyday people encounter incredible souls like yourself, but I think it's awesome that you're naturally willing to look out for someone you don't even know..
10mpxmh,j651p22,,Hope no... Energy to keep going... Absolutely!
10mpxmh,j678h08,,In my experience, the times I was homeless I was always able to find something to eat, and rarely went hungry.  When you're not slaving all day and have to spend most of your money on bills, you have a lot more time to focus on feeding yourself.  The hungriest times in my life was when I was working low wage jobs and living in shitty apartments, struggling financially.  Applying for food stamps in that situation I was always told "You make slightly too much money to qualify for food assistance".
10mpxmh,j696v2u,,My first meal in my first shelter was something I won‚Äôt forget for awhile. It was simple, made from things that I had to throw together, but I made it, and it filled me up for the first time in months.
10mpxmh,,j6991n1,Sounds satisfying
10mpxmh,,j69tkj0,It was üíï
10mpxmh,j67j8w7,,In 2019 I was homeless for 6 months though I've been homeless a few times before that. I frequented a small park located close to a shopping mall and often would just sleep on a small dilapidated picnic bench. One day I awoke as usual during the day, but to my surprise there was a paper bag next to me. I kinda freaked out a bit because I thought someone had stayed there while I was asleep and maybe left it and forgot it. I opened it just to be sure and to my surprise there was a beautifully built sandwich, a bottle of soda and some fruit and small other snacks.   It then occurred to me that "someone" must of seen me frequently and anonymously left me a meal for the day. Almost broke down. I looked around trying to see if that person was still around or any signs that the person was in the area but to no avail. Needless to say, that was the best sandwich and coke I've ever eaten in my entire life. Human's can be pretty awesome sometimes.
10mpxmh,j6e8npf,,For me, the kindness of strangers means more to me than the meal itself.
10mpxmh,j6oshia,,One meal that made a difference, not necessarily a good one, was getting supplies from the food pantry at my HIV clinic. I ended up spitting out sour pretzels, and I was sure to let them know.  That's when I realized, even churches are content with throwing their expired crumbs to the dogs. That was the same crime of Sodom (Exe 16:49). Now, I'm sharing that if you love your neighbor as yourself, you would be sacrificing the firstling of your flock. I take no issue calling them hypocrites.  If you wouldn't eat it, don't give it to others.
10mldvv,j64c1t3,,I‚Äôm getting a job very soon and I‚Äôll be going back to college to acquire certification as an addiction counseler.   That‚Äôll get half my homies back on their feet. I watched two good guys overdose yesterday.
10mldvv,,j64chbm,Such a harsh reality. You're a superhero in your own right.  Bless you
10mldvv,,j64fw28,Thanks.  I survived some very difficult medical issues last year and ended up out here.  I beat my own addiction two years ago.  I can‚Äôt help but think I‚Äôm supposed to do this.
10mldvv,j64h06v,,I am definitely concerned. I NEVER ever thought I would be. I've seen a few people who I was shocked to see out on the street. Rent got so high along with everything else getting more expensive but not getting paid more at work. It's impossible for the people who were poor to begin with.
10mldvv,,j64rief,Yes rent increase is a huge problem. Where i used to exist renters were so stupid. Instead of demanding no rent increase they demanded rent increase buy lower. The property wasn't even suitable for any increase. Annual increases only began as of 2015 when a new landlord with a bad world-wide reputation came and doubled the rent. Nobody lifted a finger to fight the city hall rent control.
10mldvv,j65lsxr,,OP is a scammer.  Their very short post and comment history has mainly only links to a "raffle" by the same name as their username, 'Game2Win'\]  Don't give an adbot karma.
10mldvv,,j65pzxz,I stopped reading OP after ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about something real, homelessness‚Äù, ummm read the room?
10mldvv,,j6798yw,It's truly NOT fair of you to make those ridiculous allegations.. If you even just checked us out, you'd realize Give2Win is Canadian organization that solely feeds people on the streets, through a unique program that gives away sponsored prizes.
10mldvv,,j6sksby,You mean, like checking out your other reddit content on your profile?  Like, farming for Karma points and upvotes in a sub dedicated to farming karma?  You know, to add the appearance of legitimacy to a 2+ year old profile for a group dedicated to helping people, while having almost zero karma built up over that time.  Also, at least by what Reddit keeps track of, you aren't very helpful, and the people here on reddit appear to agree that the content you contribute isn't very helpful, considering they aren't showing their approval with upvotes/karma.  $25 donation to cover a single meal for a homeless person... and you justify this by saying that this expense is necessary to cover "costs" due to inflation?  Have you ever heard of a Soup Kitchen?  Do you know how many people they can feed for $25?  Don't you think you should investigate more?  Hell... feeding starving children in Africa only costs $0.30 cents a day.  And we have to ship that food a much greater distance.  And... these here are NOT ridiculous allegations on my part, when I pull the information from your profile, your posts, and your comments.... so don't try redirecting the conversation with any dismissive crap like that.
10mldvv,,j6vsyyr,Are you aware that ONE breakfast meal at a local deli is almost $23 plus tip? And that's before inflation...  Our program is one of many to feed the people in need. Therefore, if you choose to donate to a "charity" or "non-profit organization" that can potentially feed over 100 people for $25...? please be my guest.  It's also important to acknowledge that Give2Win is a for-profit organization that was just recently launched 2 years ago. So of course there's minimal posts on this account.  I thoroughly understand your concerns, but please also understand this, no one is asking you to join our free vacation giveaways and kindly support our cause if you don't want to...
10mldvv,,j6xhasr,>Are you aware that ONE breakfast meal at a local deli is almost $23 plus tip? And that's before inflation...  I'm aware that I can go to any of the Donut Ave. chains around here, and get a Cheeseburger combo with fries, a drink, and a donut, for under $10.  That's now, with the current inflation.  The Double Cheeseburger with Bacon combo is like $12.  I'm aware that with the current inflation, I can get a loaf of bread for $2, a pack of Bologna and sliced cheese for $3 each, and I can make sandwiches that cost less than $1 each.  Are you saying there is no middle ground between the meal you present, and the meal options I present?  Again... I ask... have you ever actually looked into the cost per meal served by a Soup Kitchen?
10mldvv,,j6xj715,I appreciate you making my point for me.   If you were a for-profit business, you can charge whatever you want for a meal consisting of an entree (bread, meat on the bread & cheese), a side, and a beverage. You are allowed to ethically charge whatever you want, just like McDonalds and all the others..  And if your agenda is to make no-profit and feed as many people as humanly possible, then you can virtually serve unlimited meals at pennies on the dollar...  The price of a meal is subjective and whatever the perceived value is, people will pay.  Our brand, Give2Win, encourages people to commit the approx cost of 1 meal for them-self, at least once per month, which creates an amazing ripple effect in our world, and then those people also get the possibility to win any of our sponsored vacation prize giveaways. Win-win!!
10mldvv,j64g8he,,Yes
10mldvv,j64mikv,,Ongoing pandemic? The pandemic is over. More like ongoing proxy war. No funding to help own citizens. All goes into the war industry.  Not all homeless are the same. Volunteering and standing up for whatever won't solve anything. It's a lot more complicated. Now that i'm homeless i understand. Even if you build luxury homes to house every single homeless in the country, it won't solve anything. I browse through hundreds of links and pages "resources" for the poor and homeless. I've called some places from those links. It's only "on paper". There's no proper support and help for different kinds of homeless. Not all are the same.
10mldvv,,j65dcbu,This is true.
10mldvv,,j65rxcj,The pandemic isn't over. Misinformation helps no one.

10mldvv,,j64wtep,Other countries too üòî
10mldvv,j66tqxr,,The best approach would be to divide the homeless into demographic groups and case workers and volunteer legal students help each demographic separately. For example homeless people with probable psychosis or apparent schizophrenia could be rounded up and taken to a mental hospital where social workers could help them apply for disability benefits. Homeless people who are undocumented aliens with no work papers and no legal rights to be in the country could be rounded up and introduced to law students whereupon they could be given assistance applying for an O visa. Homeless people with addiction problems could be transported to rehab/detox facilities. Situationally homeless people with no drug addiction and no apparent psychosis could be set up with an appointment at the employment center and offered a free bus ticket to get there. Jailbird recidivists on a revolving door to the correctional system probably are too difficult to help at all, sociopathy isn‚Äôt considered curable. Some people can‚Äôt be helped. Past parole officers have already done everything possible. Their situation is what it is.
10mldvv,,j6beo0z,I like this idea. I don‚Äôt get the downvotes on your comment lol.
10mldvv,j65rqnj,,You want the people who are already homeless to effect change?
10mldvv,j66klor,,Every little bit won't help, or else it would have.  In San Francisco, why not require all new buildings anywhere to be at least 15 stories high and of a certain quality?  Then, gaurentee a small multi-million dollar profit?  Then also require the owner to not rent it out.  Only sell the apartments and only rent if it's rent to own?   Then get rich jerks to build a shit load fast.  Why not?  They are guaranteed profit (no risk)  sooner its built, the more profitable (stagnet money has a cost overtime).  Safe investment in housing on San Francisco that's a win win? Probably would work out.  How bout Dat derr?
10mldvv,j66qrcl,,From first hand observation and involvement the homeless situation in SLC is out of control and growing daily. Stop by 200 s and the area anytime. The cops are horrific. As abatements are a regularly occurrence as belongs, medications, animals and people are scrapped away like trash. And no place to go. I have documented homeless community attacks for years. And SLC has a established national reputation for homeless abuse ...and periodically murdered homeless.
10mldvv,j6pn8rh,, There are areas who actually NEED people. Smaller towns, and older mid-cities want people to come in and are affordable. Issue is job market for so many, if you work remote or from home and like home towns, and can entertain yourself & like to take short trips.... then please look into areas that need people.    Maybe you think about being a truck driver -- just an example -- a mid-size town could work, if you drive for a living there are still places where you can get a decent size house but have to make some adjustments. BEFORE you scalp this is being heavy discussed in many places, not everyone can afford NYC , Denver, LA ...and those are not the only cities in the US.    Just my thoughts.
10mkp8z,j63r437,,Going to California is your best bet. The weather good all year round. Good social services too. I recommend sf or san Diego.

10mkp8z,j66s97y,,Wish I could go with you.
10mkp8z,,j66tdvg,Also, just so you know, we have a much better chance of being housed here in Minnesota than other places. Cali might be sunny and generous with the food stamps and medical but do they ever actually house anyone? For years I've read stories of dread online about how it is out there. Who wants to go out there just to die alone in a tent?
10mkp8z,,j68f2lf,Well id rather die in a tent in cali or ride a wave out than in snowbank at negative 20 in Minnesota lol
10mkp8z,j6abshs,,Even if it doesn't fit the timeline that you're on, you must apply for SSDI so that you can avail yourself to more income.  Even if you are rejected multiple times, you will eventually win. And when you do, they will pay you a lump sum to cover all the time between your award and the first time that you applied for SSDI.  So do not wait, apply for it. Work with one of your doctors to do so.  As for your kids and the apartment that you are in, find a way out. Report the abuse with police reports. Hire an attorney to help you get out of the lease, using those police reports. Stop listening to the voice in your head that is telling you that you should not report them. They have betrayed you.  Every state has disabled and senior housing. Your disability likely qualifies you for it, and your SSI can be used for your rent. In order to access those opportunities, you're going to have to get in touch with some social workers who work with seniors and those who have disabilities. They can point you to the proper programs that will help house you.  Do not tell anyone of your plan. Do not use your plan as a way to say "fuck you" to your abusers. Silently act, and silently depart. Do not let them know where you're going.
10mkp8z,,j6cw95m,Thank you! I really appreciate your thoughtful and in-depth response! I don‚Äôt know why I never pushed for ssdi and I‚Äôm going to look into this as well as the other advice!!!
10mkp8z,j6ea8ha,,Arizona has really high cost of living you will need to rent a room. there are long wait lists for hosuing and its so expensive out here. CA is worse than AZ too expensive.   Look into renting  a room if you are female live with another female .
10mjkgw,j63e30k,,I don‚Äôt know the laws there but I personally would recommend you calling your local cps, child protection services. They have to house you as a minor in the states. If you want to be housed. Otherwise you can try hooking up with other unhoused people. Look at groups like vagabond, travelers, facebook group dirty couch kids coalition is an extensive network of people who are mostly homeless on purpose and travel everywhere and they help each other out. Just giving you some ideas of what is available in the states and maybe you can find something there similar
10mjkgw,j64szav,,I‚Äôm going to tell you the same thing I told the newbie at the shelter last night.   Guard your phone like it‚Äôs solid gold.  Hers is gone now because she let her guard down.     iPhones don‚Äôt resell for much, but androids do because they can be factory reset by anyone in seconds.   They are low hanging fruit for addicts or anyone desperate enough to steal.  Good luck to you. üôè

Maybe you can borrow a tent or swag from a friend for a couple weeks if you can't get to a shelter? I have contacts in the area and will see if I can post up more info for you.  Seeing this post makes me Wish I was Bill gates or Branson rich, I'd open up a Hostel/shelter in every major city and town in Oz for 25 and under. Be safe and stay dry. Go to the library if it's open where you're at, afaik internationally they are supposed to be "safe places" charge your phone and dry off.  If you're between Brisbane and Hervey Bay there should be some decent resources that area.  Sending good vibes your way!
10mjkgw,j659np5,,Cardboard under you if you're gonna sleep outside and over you if you can't access bedding. Keep your possessions like your wallet in your shoe, your phone the same but remember it's there before you stand up üëç.  Also do they have youth shelters where you are? And stay positive. I was your age when it all started for me and I know you probably don't want to call a child worker for help. Just remember IT ISNT OVER! This is a thing that will pass. For every mild setback a major comeback follows... Survive.
10mjkgw,j65h5ua,,I don‚Äôt know anything about Australia or what resources might be available but heavily seconding the person who mentioned youth shelters if you have access to one or can get to an area that has one. They‚Äôre a heck of a lot better than the more general adult shelters- though all the advice about stealing and guarding your phone largely remains true. Would say it was better overall but don‚Äôt be stupid. And on the youth shelter front, also don‚Äôt be stupid and do things other teens in the shelter might be trying to pull you along for that could get you kicked out- I saw quite a bit of that the two times I was in youth shelters. I think the peer pressure and just everyone wanting to have friends stuff is a lot harder when you‚Äôre younger. I‚Äôd look the other way, not snitch, and try to get along but at some point never forget to look out for you and you alone.   Youth shelter is probably the best that can happen for you. Conversely I‚Äôd keep an eye out for other young folks on the streets if that doesn‚Äôt pan out because you‚Äôre probably safer with folks your age.

10mb6c5,j62caui,,Congrats! Can you give us any tips? I know guys who have been waiting years with no success?
10mb6c5,,j62eqz3,Honestly I just got extremely fucking lucky, and had some higher powers on my side. Had  kickass caseworkers that went above and managed to find the resources for me. Unfortunately it helps I'm AFAB, Women have a lot more resources than men do- which sucks.
10mb6c5,,j62h8cg,I am happy for you, but disgusted at the discrimination against entire groups of ppl based on things out of their control.  Like... this is supposed to be 2023... we're supposed to have equality... but the reality is really messed up... and then when men act up as a result of the lack of help, ppl go "oh, it's just testosterone!" or "men don't ask for help!"  like ffs.... if it wasn't so sad, I could laugh.
10mb6c5,,j62ih2q,Yeah it's honestly shit. Patriarchal bullshit affects both sides. Men have higher rates of untreated mental illness, suicidal thoughts, homelessness, and addiction. Males in a DV situation are disproportionately painted as the aggressor. And when yall try to ask for help you're told "Shut up and be a man."
10mb6c5,,j63yiu6,I agree. The discrimination is especially more prominent against men who aren't "Alpha males."  Because we're expected to constantly compete with each other. Like primitive cavemen.
10mb6c5,,j63n5qp,There‚Äôs one shelter I can go to. There‚Äôs four for women.     Last night a drunk girl grabbed my junk in front of a worker when I went out for a smoke at 5am.  Ugh

10mb6c5,j63eo30,,How do you get a caseworker?
10mb6c5,,j6453u8,So I'm not sure what city you're in, but you can look up the homeless/housing authority for your city, or the nearest large metropolitan area near your city. I'm in los Angeles. I'm mentally and physically disabled which helped my case immensely. You also can go to your nearest Social Services building (in some cities it's also in the local major courthouse) and ask for help.
10mauq4,j620gl1,,Didn't TN recently pass a law that made it a felony to sleep in a tent?
10mauq4,,j621fkw,But yeah. It's a pretty shit law. No camping on public property, a felony.
10mauq4,,j621ka8,For public property not designated for camping (so things like parks, underpasses, etc).  I guess if OP is on private woods then it just might potentially be trespassing.
10mauq4,,j620prx,Yes which is why I am looking at a small, camo tent that I can set up and take down easily  I don't have many other options since I don't have a car and I can't lose my job
10mauq4,j62kn4r,,Findhelp.org collects local resources and lists them for you. Good luck, stay safe, stay warm and keep coming back here. It's a great support system, let's you vent, throw around ideas, lots of good people in similar situations.
10mauq4,j628i1b,,Hide well and you won't have an issue
10mauq4,j63epcv,,Income based housing is a good place to start. Keep a notebook of everywhere you apply. I don‚Äôt know what resources are available there. Try posting in a local Facebook group for homelessness or a regular Facebook group for your city and ask for resources, income based housing units, section 8 housing, and any community resources, try calling 211, and have a list ready for what resources you need and then write down everything they give you.
10mauq4,j665ozk,,Get those foam pads for the floor of the tent to insulate you from the ground. I always use them when I got camping, retains heat and softer surface to lay on.
10mauq4,j6adk3l,,Some people are able to keep their cats. But it is very difficult to do so without traumatizing them.  If you can find somebody to take them temporarily while you use the Lion's share your resources to rebuild your life, then that may work.
10mauq4,,j6adr87,I wouldn't do that to them. Plus I'd be at work most of the time, can't exactly bring them with me there lol. As much as it would hurt me, I'd find them new homes if I have to, for their sake.
10mauq4,j6eay2q,,Join plant fitness or any cheap gym and you can shower and relax there. Rent a room  ask your co workers if you can crash on their couch for a few weeks, Your cats are going to be a problem lots of people are allergic..esa or not most dont want them in a home unless there are cat there. Post locally on FB and see if anyone can foster your cats for a couple months   Donate plasma. See if you can rent a cheap car to sleep in on Turo. Ask around homeless outreach near you for a bike. At this point a bike with a lock is better than none. Can you rent a room for 500 or so?
10mauq4,,j6ej6pg,I actually can't donate plasma. They turn me away for my small, rolling veins every time lol!
10mauq4,,j6ejc9k,I have a job. It's full time, pays 14 an hour. I've had it for a while. Its the housing problem here that I'm running into an issue with. I make too much to qualify for programs but I don't make enough to get an apartment with my income and bad credit.
10mauq4,,j6ejpqk,If I had a vehicle it'd be no problem. I think I'm gonna sleep outside for a bit and then try to buy a Lil used car that's hopefully not a lemon and graduate to living in that car until I can get approved for housing somewhere.
10mauq4,j65acex,,I'm not in the same area, but the tips I usually give are Cardboard under you (even in a tent. Hide it with a garbage bag in a bush when you don't need it)  Be prepared to be kicked out of the area (don't fully unpack, just the essential bedding and food)  Stay positive (It's a stepping stone not a mountain in you path)

10m8ued,,j625o6z,get a Conversion Van, it's great for urban camping and plenty of space for your cats as well for you, a mini-van may sound great but they don't offer much space, there's not a lot of space.

10m8ued,j631l5h,,I spent 6 months homeless in the back of a truck moving to different campsites every 2 weeks in Escondido, CA. It really didn't feel like being homeless. I had a safe spot to go to every night where I was allowed to be and a spot to shower and do basic grooming. I eventually got a tent and picked up a mattress that someone had tossed on the side of the freeway, and at that point i damn near felt like I had an actual home to sleep in.   Back then the campsites were about $12-$15 a night, so it wasn't that much cheaper than renting a room, but I couldn't find someone to rent a room to me, so camping was the best alternative I could find.  I tried to save money by parking in parking lots or residential areas but usually a cop would come and knock on my window and tell me to leave. I wound up being so anxious about it that I couldn't get any sleep. Having a spot were I was allowed to be made all the difference.
10m8ued,j63d94p,,I would be applying for income based housing. Also section 8 public housing is income based. I‚Äôm in Minnesota not cali so I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs quite different there. Don‚Äôt limit yourself to only a van. I have a eddie bauer I‚Äôve seriously been contemplating ripping out my 3 rows of back seats for a mattress for me and my dog and packing my shit and driving to cali, seriously. I‚Äôm in a bad situation and I hate mn. If you‚Äôre disabled you can apply for housing just for disabled persons. The rental apps at least for Minnesota are pretty much useless. Its web based searches and posting on local groups like Facebook asking for information on income based housing places. Don‚Äôt be scared of waiting lists, typically a waitlist is 75% void because once they open apartments and start calling people on the list, wrong number, unreachable, already found a place etc. put your name on every list you can and keep a notebook of which places you applied with the name address and phone number and the date you applied. Make sure you update them with current information.
10m8ued,j61t28h,,$3000 isn't likely to get you a very reliable van these days. Unfortunately, buying vans and spending ridiculous money to make them into little houses is a current fad for the American middle class. In a couple years, when the fad is over, there's going to be a glut of van conversions on the market and probably some really good deals, but right now it's hard to find anything that even runs for under $5000.  Of course, anything at all you can sleep in is going to be great for you pretty soon since the hotels will suck you dry. Is there any way you could make your current car better for sleeping in, though? Take out the backseat, put in blackout curtains, things like that. It's possibly a better option than a low cost van.  As for finding a real roof, have you tried looking at shared houses/rooms for rent? That's not just for college kids anymore and actually there's some real nice places available. Better any day than dealing with property management firms.
10m8ued,,j61vxxu,I've had way too many roommate/shared living nightmares to even consider placing my well-being into the hands of someone else again. Car-dwelling is not for sissies but I'd rather do that than situate myself around someone else. I'm just trying to weigh all my options because if I'm gonna be homeless, I must find the most practical way to be homeless.

Had ample income and great employment and rental history refs. But, Thin credit score. You see where I'm going with this? How much $$$ are property management companies or leasing agents making from costly lease app fees? Are app fees more profitable than actually renting the unit? Let's do the math. And while we're at it. Let's talk about Equifax, Experion, TransUnion, and how much power and control they have over our lives. Forcing people to finance, go into debt, just to qualify for shelter.

Very reliable cars .seats go all the way back and I usually slept in the front seats ....unless my back was aching...I then had a air mattress  for the back.. had a cooler I would utilize and a few totes of other stuff like clothes ,soap , and other necessities . Good luck ! I've been there but it's not the worse thing ever  ! Lots of time to think when you are there. Sometimes I wish I could just return to it. It's humbling to say the least .....but it's not that expensive ! Especially the prices of food ,gas and rent these days.

10m8ued,j63nuqf,,I‚Äôve been homeless in your area since Oct. I was having the same problems but things are getting better and I‚Äôve been learning. I‚Äôm so close to being out of homelessness. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say:  Not everyone is cut out to live in a car. I can sleep anywhere. My sister, not so much. I had to take her to the hospital for blood flow issues. Unless you plan on investing in a really REALLY good mattress make sure you‚Äôre actually capable of sleeping there. My sister went about 3 months until I literally had to take her to the hospital every night. It was terrible and I literally had to hear her cry herself to sleep every night, and we ended up camping in the mud regardless because otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt sleep.  Assuming you‚Äôre not superhuman like me and capable of sleeping in a car indefinitely:  Look for rooms for rent that are being sublet. There‚Äôs Craigslist, and also cheap places near colleges. Students usually have parents that have good credit scores if you need a guarantor, just pay the other half of the rent. Put an ad on paper at the local colleges nearby. Plus there are plenty of female only college situations where you‚Äôll feel safe, and the parents would probably feel safer that you‚Äôre female. Not all college students party. Some are older, some are more studious and quiet. You can even live really cheaply if there more people.  Otherwise, look into a guarantor service, which is a service that helps you qualify for housing BUT you take the fall if you fuck up.  Also look into renting an office and secretly living in it, just say you‚Äôre making a start up and working 24/7 is an option. Get a gym membership for showering.  Just make sure to take care of your health. Plus if you lose the car that‚Äôs losing your home. At least with a room or place you can rely on busing or rent a car if you‚Äôre desperate.  UberEats and Doordash have literally saved my life, but also I‚Äôm currently switching to a job in sales/life insurance. I‚Äôm just studying for my license exam atm. Look for sales jobs that are remote, where you don‚Äôt need to find leads, and where it‚Äôs commission based because there‚Äôs no cap on what you can make. You‚Äôll be much happier with a job where there‚Äôs no cap on the money, and you have an opportunity to make as much as you want.  I can even talk to the people I‚Äôm with. Maybe I can give you a link to send your resume too?  I‚Äôve heard great things about the solar industry too!  Also, if you‚Äôre food insecure or have trouble cooking, multivitamins on top of EBT and food bank stuff can help you not get sick. Eating junk food and food that isn‚Äôt cooked everyday will kill you! Get free big waters from Starbucks and don‚Äôt pay for it! Drink water and get nutrients every day!  EDIT: me and my sister are both trans. Feel free to dm us since we know services you will qualify for! You shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for hotels!!
10m8ued,j641pdj,,Yes you will end up with garbage. Consider the cost of repairs and maintenance.

10m5ajp,j617ilb,,Perfectly well said, some of these people who say that the mental ill are dangerous and are on on drugs all the time need to spend a few nights in a homeless shelter. Also they should "get a job" and see what the homeless shelters say after that and treat you after that, and then try to rent an apartment while living in an homeless shelter.  Some need to see what and how the shoe fits before they say that all are bad and most have a mental issue.
10m5ajp,j65t93u,,I wonder what percentage of housed-people check the facts of homelessness for themselves before tarring all the homeless with the same brush?

10m2v2u,,j65irly,Oh this is an interesting point I hadn‚Äôt considered. I‚Äôm in a very complex medical situation really fucking me around and eh the only person to argue with me was my jackass younger brother who was adamant I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúreally homeless‚Äù because I was in a shitty hotel. Dude was dealing with his own shit and clearly some messy effed up family dynamics but I admit that I might have gotten more help sooner but was confused myself by whether I ‚Äúactually counted‚Äù as I was losing my housing and had a friend covering a nicer hotel for a bit.   I definitely see how others might be thinking ‚Äúeh I have a place no matter how shady and questionable to rest my head for the time being. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go try and get serviced because others need it more‚Äù. I have noticed some places are better than others at actually describing their definition of who they help or what they consider ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù but on its face, yeah. I also think there‚Äôs a lack of awareness of how many of us are in these super tenuous situations but not out and out on a piece of cardboard on the street.
10m2v2u,j62p4sf,,Because being homeless is not great. When you really think of a person's circumstances when homeless, it is awful. By saying something different it dampens a person's feeling about someone who is homeless, which is bad. We need some level sympathy regarding the homeless and not wanting to use the word is not wanting to feel sympathy toward another person.
10m2v2u,j60mlor,,>sounds pretentious and overall unproductive. It's not like it changes    people's views on homeless people or helps homeless people.  Truth.  It's like the descriptor, "ladies of the night."  Calling people who are forced to sell access to their bodies for sex "ladies of the night" rather than prostitutes (or 'who\*res') doesn't make their lives any easier or get at solving the problem.  It's just another meaningless tiny pushback that the system permits in order to give the appearance that it's open to changing without ever needing to do so.  The idea behind it is that calling someone 'homeless' makes that individual's lack of housing the only pertinent thing about them.  Similar to how describing someone as a junkie defines them by their relationship to drugs and ignores everything else about them.  To illustrate the difference, the actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) was a junkie and died of it, but people still treated him like a person, because was also a successful actor.  He would have described as 'an actor with a drug problem' instead of a druggie.    So for homelessness, saying, this or that person is 'unhoused' or 'experiencing homelessness' implies two important things.  One that their lack of home is merely one of many things that make them who they are, and secondly that that condition is temporary, rather than defining.
10m2v2u,j618bkz,,Because "homeless" insinuates that you are a stranger that does not belong anywhere and that you are no one's responsibility.  The physical reality is that your country is still your home. Your province/region/state is still your home. Your city is still your home. you still belong here. You are not suddenly "Hometown-less"  "person without shelter" would be a lot more accurate and less stigmatizing imo.
10m2v2u,j61g3e4,,I feel like people wanna use those terms because they're personally uncomfortable with the situation, and to feel less guilty about it, they wanna change terminology to make them feel better while doing absolutely nothing of value to actually help.  I've had people try and correct me when I say homeless, and no, I won't change the word I use. People should be uncomfortable about it. I wasn't houseless, I was homeless
10m2v2u,j61g2j8,,You seem to really love saying that phrase. Sometimes a change of language can freshen up your perspective. Try it.
10m2v2u,j62rlqv,,Because in USA, PC wording is everything. Other than a solution. I would prefer American homeless be called 'PRICED OUT". $2K/month for a 1 bedroom apartment? Not "homeless" or "unhoused" or "houseless". **PRICED OUT.**
10m2v2u,j613zgw,,Some people think that the word homeless has a negative connotation to it. Of course, that‚Äôs dependent on your audience and what their impression of the homeless is, so which word you choose should really depend on the situation.
10m2v2u,,j616eu2,Judging by the anti-homeless people that I know I don't think it would matter what anyone called it; their still going to hate homeless people.  You can call it whatever you want, but at the end of the day it's still the same thing and people still hold the same beliefs.
10m2v2u,j63sjqv,,In some social situations I dont like to let on that im homeless, but unhoused or houseless is practically the same word  Euphemisms I've used are "roughin' it" "out and about" "camping under duress" "In a social living arrangement" "Living at no fixed address" "fallen through the cracks"  When addressing another person I think is homeless, I ask "You roughin' it too?"  I met one lady who uses the word "transient", don't think thats a bad one.  When people think about the word "homeless" it comes packed with a lot of baggage.

10lzser,j66ycs2,,Thanks for being a good person. It sucks how many of us- male or female though I‚Äôll agree with you that it skews heavily towards the homeless women being the ones with the most health/ disability complications (that‚Äôs my reality.)- are in the situations we are with age related issues, medical ones, or pregnant women.   I finally came up to the top of the list for a project based voucher (so not section 8. Waitlists have been closed for years everywhere around me and I‚Äôve been in a couple of different Midwest states) for disabled and/ or homeless folks. I was living in a another state but so wanted to get back to that city. Took a train in yesterday and spent so much money, time, and health. But because I didn‚Äôt have a freaking physical social security card and couldn‚Äôt get one in time. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to even apply. After all the shit I went through and money paid to get replacement documents. Stupid because I have my social security number memorized and was also presenting my award letter for disability. And a birth certificate and drivers license. That‚Äôs how fucking cruel and fucked up Chicago‚Äôs housing authority is (national level HUD says it‚Äôs up to individual housing authorities whether they require a SSN at all. Fuck this shit. You don‚Äôt even need a physical social security card to work!). Basically was told by the screening person she‚Äôs often watched people lose out on housing over this very same issue.   So I have mixed feelings on your theory of giving homeless folks some kind of ID number. Maybe if there was a way to truly validate it where Section 8 and housing authorities would be able to take just that number (because how many homeless folks are walking around with their social security cards and birth certificates and crap?). So many stupid damn hoops they make us jump through to even try to get help and then they try to claim we all just want to stay homeless. Bullshit. We are sick and tired and sick of being treated as less than human and forced to jump through pointless hoops to even try to get out most basic needs met.   Anyway. Sorry for my rants. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what hope I have left when a stupid social security card (and how rushed housing authorities make the process if you do make it to top of a waitlist. I‚Äôd been on this one for four years. Long before I was actually homeless) lost me the first real chance at some help I had. I‚Äôm real glad you got your voucher. Stories like yours are the only thing keeping me going. I was begging for hospice and ready to take my out months ago. Sometimes I think my mistake was to keep fighting.
10lzser,,j672f82,You can go online to Social Security, ssa.gov... Sign up, sign in, go to replacement social security card... And when you are finished you can print out a letter that is acceptable ANYWHERE as a social security card. You're just waiting for it to be mailed to you. As for an address, you can either have it go to a local YMCA, a shelter..even a library. Do you know that in some states a Library card that you have signed is an acceptable for of ID.  Ya gotta have ID, birth certificate and your ss card. I know it's hard for some people..and some people are afraid to even go into shelters. But keep in mind, shelters are 'Do Overs'. You get to start you life over again. My sole purpose was in the MANY shelters I have been in was to.. Rest my head and wash my ass.  Look at ALL bulletin boards for information. Always have something to write with on you at all times. In shelters they have the means and ways to get all types of paperwork you need.   Another thing to look at too. Never be ashamed of what you're going thru, don't beat yourself up.Me out on the streets like I was, can't nobody beat me up better than I can, so I'll be damned if someone tries to do it to me. The staff, yeah they can be A holes. But no one out a gun to their head and made them ask, apply interview and accept the job. If it wasn't for me and my fellow residents being here, you wouldn't have a job. But ya can't say that to them.  Following the rules, you always have to follow the rules. The one I was in had a curfew at 10 and 11pm. No one outside after 11pm. I wake up at 2am, asked the staff can I go out and smoke a cigarette..they let me. It's who and how you ask. You ask for things, you respect the staff..they notice. You don't have to hang out with anyone, you don't even have to talk to the other residents if you don't want to. I was there to do one thing, get out and on my own.  Once a week I go back to the shelter, they have serve 3 meals a day, they have a Pantry. I can get 2 food boxes a month. I get one every 2 months because it's way too much food.  You get a chance Private message me.
10lzser,,j6738nb,Oh shit. Really? I had the housing person throw me over to social security to beg for some sort of document. She fucked me over telling me she‚Äôd help me apply for the card and holy fuck. If we had just done that yesterday. Oh god. That stings. Social security never explained that part either when I showed up in person (caused me to miss my train back and I should probably be in a hospital right now because of the medical consequences of it all). They just kept insisting i couldn‚Äôt lose out on housing and I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ yes that‚Äôs what they told me.   Fuck. That really sucks. And today was the very last day though supposedly they‚Äôd gotten an extension for me so I don‚Äôt know. I got mislead and screwed around.   Damn it. The address thing but also the fact that I‚Äôm in one state but the housing thing was in another left me not sure what to do. Thanks though. I‚Äôve been wondering if half my problem is not speaking up or saying more sooner. Because I feel like if I had learned this even yesterday‚Ä¶ everything would be different.
10lzser,,j6apbid,Is a copy of a social security card, birth certificate and driver's license acceptable or enough? or do they require the physical document?

We use to sing a song about him.. . 'JB follow me, to the bottom of the sea, while you're there, wash your hair and your dirty underwear.' WOW!! That shit just came to me. Bums were not  called homeless, I don't think the word was even invented or used.  PS 99, JHS 136 and Art and Design HS.

10lxy7r,j5znzbj,,Considering how expensive SF is, I'm not sure if I'd recommend it. Have you checked out any local programs that provide rent assistance? I also recommend checking out your city's anti-homelessness organizations, and contacting them about your situation. Since it doesn't sound like you're homeless yet, I think your best bet is to prevention.
10lxy7r,,j5zokag,Denver is expensive af too lol but it‚Äôs also freezing and SF is not. Thanks for the input
10lxy7r,j63f51j,,Start applying for income based housing. Keep a notebook listing everything you apply for. Call 211 and post in Facebook groups for information and resources, fb search your city and keywords like, charity, free, homeless, housing, homeless, resources

10lxy7r,j600mzp,,Neither city is affordable to live in.  Both are pressed to the max for resources, housing, etc.  Denver however has the worst weather imaginable for a homeless person.  You need some decent gear to be on the street this time of the year in Denver.  Someone on here recently made a post about going to Denver and didn't realize how bad it can get and badly regretted it.  If you have the gear to survive, go for it.  If you don't, head somewhere warm.
10lxy7r,,j60a3i6,Ok, so where is a good place to be to get in quickly with affordable housing resources etc
10lxy7r,,j60acrh,It's not going to be easy anywhere.  Can you at least get into a shelter in Denver?

10lxy7r,,j619wih,Yep.
10lxy7r,j5zu7op,,Yes head to San Francisco
10lxy7r,j61tkd7,,San Francisco is not only completely unaffordable, they're also experiencing a MAJOR housing crisis along with Los Angeles. Even with $10K in your pocket, you won't find a place to live. It's just too expensive and the shortage means that landlords are only accepting the cream of the crop of renters. I am actually from Denver, born and raised, so I'll tell you that you do not want to be homeless there. Not only is it horrifically cold, it's unsafe. Denver has a very high number of crazies roaming the streets, and the number increases daily. Very few, if any, shelters or mental healthcare facilities. It's dangerous.   Want to find affordable housing, jobs and year-round warm weather? Go to Phoenix.
10lxy7r,,j62o2y3,Yes Phoenix IS THE BEST..lived there and you can survive ...nites can get cold...Days are hot but u might find housing or shelters easier...Rather be Hot than freezing better for 4 legged friend..GET out of Denver as soon as possible..if u have access to internet contact programs in Az before u leave..I don't know if Az has 211... phone number for resources...Call them for 211 can really provide everything you need..take care..You can do it...jobs r easier to find in Az..it may take a little time but pool jobs, landscaping..etc..good luck
10lxy7r,,j64yw58,Thank you!!!
10lxy7r,,j6ebkv8,AZ is expensive as shit if you have a car you can do DD and UE. superbowl and very busy season is here. Join a cheap gym and sleep in your car until you can get a room. There are tons and tons of job here..fast food..stores..you should be able to get a job. Gig jobs dry up in summer when its slow season so you will need to find some sort of other employment which should be easy if you put any effort in it
10lxy7r,,j6eb7gu,AZ has 211 but we have so many people moving here its unafforable and hommeless resources are pushed to the max.
10lxy7r,,j6jniny,Thanks..I think any city is getting overloaded. But I'd rather be warm than cold. There are also smaller cities in Az

10lpuy2,j5z5xq2,,Cotton kills is a good slogan to remember.  Cotton holds water and sucks the heat out of your body.  Merino wool is best, it will wick water away from your body.  Fleece doesn't absorb water, it's cheap and lightweight.
10lpuy2,,j5zeh32,\+1 cotton next to skin will kill you in low temperatures if it gets wet. Goretex shells don't work in low temperatures as the holes freeze. Use wool (preferably merino) next to skin, layers and a light windproof/ waterproof shell can even work then.  OP, you've missed using emergency blanket in that set up which will reflect back a huge amount of radiant heat or you can open up foil packaging for chips/ crisps and stick to cardboard.  If you have snowfall and continual low temperatures a tent is unnecessary as you can simply make a quinzee.
10lpuy2,,j65oec5,Learned these lessons the hard way just yesterday myself and wish I‚Äôd seen this post then. I‚Äôm not roughening it outside (thankfully because with my medical situation I‚Äôd be dead quick no matter what) but had to be out and about on a wild goose chase for what I‚Äôd hoped was going to be a housing opportunity in shitty boots in the Midwestern snow storm. Fucked up and had on some mystery synthetic blend compression socks with wool socks over those. Seems I should‚Äôve reversed that. Saw the wool moisture wicking in action but my boots kept sporadically releasing water through the soles and while the wool kept out a lot everytime it seeped through to the compression socks it was miserable.   I spent some time in a public bathroom with the hand dryer and my shoes and socks trying to dry out and warm things up but fuck, if only I had known to layer those socks in the reverse direction it would‚Äôve saved a lot of hardship. (Though sharing this now because in an emergency if you can get to a hand dryer some place it works. Though learn from me- Dry out then research/ learn how to layer up better!). God I was doing the same thing with two hats. Thin cotton hat on my head with a wool knit with fleece around the ears hat over top. Will say wool on the outside sort of does best a cotton topper though. Made it take s lot longer for moisture from the outside to come in. Just was trapping any body based moisture against me. Maybe keep your cotton between two wool layers then.
10lpuy2,,j68xdmh,Use plastic bags over the inside layer of socks as it keeps the feet warm even though wet. Also, you can use torn off sections of an emergency blanket or large chip packets with reflective foil insides to put over your socks to radiate heat back.  However, you do need to get boots off otherwise creates problems and having a dry pair of socks to put on to sleep in helps enormously. Wet boots aren't a problem if you use plastic bags, you just need to dry socks then.  The 'hothands' things work too if you have money enough to get them to keep toes warm.  If you're in Midwest still its getting real cold again tonight +wind, if you don't have face cover and do have a spare base layer, preferably merino, fold the body into three or so and use the arms to tie it behind your head...that way you cover face/ neck and with hat pulled down just leave the eyes exposed.
10lpuy2,,j5zl870,Came here just to say this. Cotton is great in the summer because it's light and breathable, but it does not wick moisture! Probably fine to wear as an outer layer, but definitely not right against your skin.   If you want something that isn't wool for your base layer there are moisture wicking synthetics. Linen is also good at wicking moisture, but I imagine hard to find, and it isn't all that warm.

However when I‚Äôm asked for money I usually tell them all I‚Äôve got on hand is my credit card and that I‚Äôd be happy to go buy them some food if they‚Äôd like. Even if they are addicts; addicts still deserve to eat so I‚Äôll buy them food and won‚Äôt give them money.
10lp222,,j62gf8t,Cash is a quick easy thing to ask for that a person walking or driving by can give, but that doesn‚Äôt mean an offer of food instead wouldn‚Äôt be accepted.  I carry hand warmers, socks, cigarettes and lunches in my work car and those are always accepted readily.  Most of the folks I work with who fly signs are trying to buy propane and food, even the ones who are using need to eat and stay warm.

10lp222,j5ykw32,,I guess some people feel like homeless people are sometimes homeless by choice. I'm in a situation now where people don't know that I'm homeless and at my job there's a man who is homeless as well. I work at Starbucks also. He's very nice and comes in every day to sit in our cafe and warm his hands with our hot water. I recall my managers talking about him horribly in front of me, totally unaware of my situation. Just brutally making fun of the man as if he's disturbing them whenever he comes in and it really bothered me. I think some people are just privileged enough within their lives to not have to understand something like this. Doesn't make it ok whatsoever but I think people assume that animals are more deserving than people because in their minds people can avoid something like homelessness. But, most of the time homeless people are not choosing to be in the circumstances they are in. It truly makes me sad because so many people deserve so much better from society.
10lp222,j5z4ued,,There are actually rings of scammers that pretend to be homeless. They work in shifts and have higher ups and everything. Happens in Detroit a lot. It hurts both the people that need help and the people trying to help.   I give money to organizations that help the homeless so that it‚Äôs going to actually help people. Or if I have some supplies like sealed bottled water or food I‚Äôll give them that.   Animals aren‚Äôt trying to scam people. Not saying they are more important just that they are completely innocent and there is zero chance they are scamming.   It sucks cause the scammers have made a lot of people shy away from giving money on the streets. I want to help the person that doesn‚Äôt have a home and needs food but not the person that has a place to live and a car and food.

10lp222,,j61vwr6,Stupid fucking take about 'rings' of scammers. Guess what, scammers scam, in all arenas of charity. Any charity you support or deem worthy has the same issue and that has zero affect on the value or need of donations. If there's a buck to be made someone will try and take it. If people give x demographic money then people will pretend to be x demographic, this has fuck all to do with actual x demographic needing or being deserving of charity.
10lp222,,j61cbne,Treating all homeless people like addicts and scammers ends in a lot more ignored people in genuine need than manipulation attempts avoided. By a lot. That's like saying no one should get SSI because some people are lying to get it. The solution to people abusing help that's available should never be to take that help away from everyone.   Also, who says scammers and addicts can't have animals?
10lp222,j5zibv7,,Tons and tons of animals do not receive help either
10lp222,j60isj5,,1. Bc people will pretend to be homeless to rip people off. 2. There's a stereotype that all homeless people are on drugs. This makes people think that they will just use whatever you give them on drugs. For example, I know people who don't like Obama phones bc they claim poor people use them to get drugs. 3. Continuing on #2, bc people think that homeless people are on drugs, unwise with money, etc. they believe that homeless people "deserved what they got." Yes, I do know people with this mindset. 4. There's also the fact that certain like disabled people, LGBTQ+ people, African-American people etc. are more likely to become homeless. You probably already know that there's lots of prejudice against the groups who are most likely to become homeless, so some people won't help them simply because of the prejudices they hold.  Unfortunately, it's the people who pretend to be homeless and the people who believe in these negative stereotypes is what makes it harder for legit homeless people.
10lp222,j5ydhao,,Honestly every time I‚Äôve been asked for food by a homeless person, I go purchase them food, then they deny it. It‚Äôs happened several times to me and other people I know. Happened yesterday. Stuff like that makes you not wanna help out.  So I now just assume they don‚Äôt actually want food and only money, and I never have cash to give.  I‚Äôve worked w animal rescue for awhile and can confidently say that most people who do it are weird, anti social, and have a ‚Äúim better than everyone else‚Äù mentality. So not going to go out of their way to help people
10lp222,,j5zca7i,If you buy food, make sure it's wrapped. People drug food and that's probably one reason they decline.
10lp222,,j5zcsif,Forsure I am sensitive to the idea of germs on food so I‚Äôd never offer something I wouldn‚Äôt eat.  With the guy yesterday he was outside of Taco Bell, asked me for food, so I ordered two burritos for door dash pickup bc I had credit. One chicken one beef. Bag was completely sealed when I handed it to the guy. He said he ‚Äújust wanted a drink or something‚Äù when he declined, but he literally had two drinks next to him‚Ä¶
10lp222,,j603gsp,It could also be something you can't eat. Dental problems are rampant. My roommate recently saw a guy asking for food, a lady gave him a sandwich, and he thanked her but appeared dejected. The roommate asked him what was up, and the guy said he couldn't eat that because of his teeth. So, my lovely roommate gave him a bunch of soup, and the guy was ecstatic.   There are a lot of different reasons food could be turned down that aren't addiction.
10lp222,,j60e7co,I gave my apple to a homeless man and he threw my apple to the ground shouting, ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt got teeth!‚Äù At first I was shocked because I was planning to eat that apple, but saw the man and thought he needed it more, and now the apple was dented on the filthy sidewalk. I was a broke grad student at the time, so it made me really sad. It was a lesson for me. Soft foods only.
10lp222,,j603ugl,No one ever mentioned addiction. There are tons of homeless people who aren‚Äôt addicts who would need money over food.

10lp222,,j5zcxe0,Gotcha. Then I dunno.
10lp222,,j5ygpkb,It's great to know that you're willing to help someone who has nothing. Most homeless people I've helped with food always tell me that people just turn their nose up and walk away. I'm not saying people are entitled to give money to homeless people, but what's wrong with giving them something if they ask? I see a lot of videos of abandoned cats and dogs being picked up from the street, taken to the vet, and even given their shots, and let me tell you something. Veterinary visits and vaccinations are not cheap. It makes me wonder: Are people really so unable to give a homeless HUMAN a $1 but are prepared to spend that much money on an animal that they recently found on the street and frequently have no intention of keeping?
10lp222,,j5yhplm,Well most people who do animal rescue do not spend as much money out of pocket for the animals care as you may think. Most of the time we provide the shots and all vetting ourselves. They‚Äôre fixed for free. Unless an animal is extremely ill we don‚Äôt see a vet because there‚Äôs no need most of the time, we have treatments on hand.  Rescues partner with vets who offer veterinary service at no cost or low cost for sick animals, most rescues get large donations for vet care frequently aswell. Just about everyone I‚Äôve met in animal rescue isn‚Äôt well off at all so kinda have to pick and choose where to put all you‚Äôve got. Like me I‚Äôm a former foster kid who‚Äôs only income is the minimal money I get from the state. This month I had to purchase a lot more food for cats than expected, I‚Äôm now completely broke. Like have to ride the three hour bus vs the 30 minute train to school broke. People only have so much to give

10lp222,j5zxmaw,,I give food and sometimes cash but there are multiple reasons why I don't usually do it. Animals don't scam. All they want is shelter, food, and affection. Humans scam, threaten, and frankly, are visually unappealing in most cases. Its not widely talked about but people will feel more threatened by a homeless man compared to an aggressive dog because ironically, at the end of the day homeless are humans. This means that people tend to not perceive them as beings needing help but rather potential adversary possessing similar intelligence and capabilities as themselves seeking to take resources from them. People feel less in danger from animals because of their size, lack of intelligence, lack of evil intent in their instinctive aggression, legally having easier time responding with lethal force, and physical appeal for their furry skin.
10lp222,j5yif33,,Because cats and dogs are cute.   I often wonder if physically attractive homeless people are more likely to receive assistance from strangers than the disheveled uggos.

10lp222,,j60l4ru,AFAIK there are more homeless men than women because, I suspect, more people are willing to help out a pretty face - in good faith or nefariously - than some fat slob of a dude in his 30s.

Other people are answering your question from other perspectives but I think that sometimes homeless people become a fixture of a city that people are taught to avoid. People have stopped looking at people as people and that is very shameful. I have always looked into peoples eyes and I‚Äôve always been concerned about their state of being. I‚Äôve reached out many times to people, people have to be willing to accept help sometimes. It‚Äôs a bad time when people stop having faith in humanity and trusting each other, but there are bad people in the world.

Then head over to St George for a hot meal and a bag with 3 ham and cheeze sandwiches, chips, pb&chz crackers, abd a sweet (cookies or cake). That's 5 fucking meals by 12:30pm. We haven't even gotten to the options for dinner (Burger-fi and Chick-fil-A at the waterfront park).
10lp222,,j648fxe,EDIT: I forgot that on Friday - walking down the street to St George is that lady with the bomb-ass hot  breakfasts. bacon, sausage, or fish with eggs, grits, toast. A breakfast sandwich and choice of honey bun ir donut.  For you non homeless lurkers here - for 90%+ of the homeless population, getting enough to eat isn't a problem. The professional parasites rely on your ignorance of just how many places serve food to the hungry (not just homeless). And don't forget that $281 in monthly food stamps benefits...

10lp222,j60bdgw,,Dogs and cats can‚Äôt get jobs
10lp222,,j60chq7,You have people who work but are still homeless, or who work but are underpaid and live in their car. Some people are forced to be in these types of situations that they do not want to be in, but they make the best of what they have. So stop thinking "it's a choice" when that isn't the case for some people.
10lp222,j698sg5,,Well for 1, begging for a $1 at our big adult age isn‚Äôt going to cut it ‚Ä¶. Getting a job and working for ur money is better than begging üôèüèΩ believe me !

10lp222,j5zt0m9,,People for some reason have more empathy for animals than for humans. That is why it is nothing if a human main character dies in a movie, but if someone kills the dog, it's heartbreaking
10lp222,j610r27,,Dogs and cats are sincere with their emotions, are not able to pretend they are something they are not.  Many people do help the homeless,  in whatever capacity can, but there is always that underlying thought/stigma that they are either lying about being homeless or lying about their homeless situation and what they want money for.  To me though, money is money, if they want to go buy drugs (and I have watch a homeless man I have given ¬£50 to, instantly get up and go buy coke with it) and it gets them through another night, then that's their perogative.  I would suggest food/water, but if a bottle or another hit eases the pain if their current life. I won't argue them on that.   Whereas you know a dog or cat will actually eat what you give them, show gratitude.   Of course, you shouldn't be helping a homeless person anyway of all you are doing it for, is to get a hit of good feelings because you feel you have done good in the world.
10lp222,j61ujd9,,Basic psychology 101- when we see an animal our brains release dopamine and oxytocin. Our motherly instincts come out, we want to protect them same goes for a baby‚Ä¶ hence humans may feel abnormally comfortable around a baby bear or lion cub as an animal to pet but to see an adult human usually doesn‚Äôt illicit the same brain chemicals. We may perceive them as threatening even if that‚Äôs not their intention.

10ll2xs,j5yjzzm,,Personally I think anyone who claims to have ‚Äúthe solution to homelessness‚Äù is probably well intentioned but misguided. This solution (just like any other solution) isn‚Äôt going to work for everyone. It is going to take a variety of different approaches to address people‚Äôs different circumstances.
10ll2xs,,j5yyle3,Agree‚Ä¶the political nonsense, legislation, spreading of misinformation, and down right lies that politics purposely spill over to the public‚Ä¶alone is enough to keep stoking the fire of the homelessness cycle.  I feel this is at least one of the many areas of homelessness that needs to be addressed, in order to be successful with providing stability and housing to individuals.
10ll2xs,j6biss8,,We use a bold statement to get your attention. Our motto is ‚Äúwe do this as a community‚Äù. So, when we say we are ending homelessness it means as a community. We‚Äôre not dumb, we know our bike campers alone won‚Äôt end homelessness. Our homeless bike campers are intended for those who will easily transition back to normal life. This clears the field for all other organizations to handle what their goals are. As of right now it is literally impossible for any organization to handle anything due to the sure vast amount of homeless in america. Does this statement make more sense now?

We don't have many hostels in the Midwest.   You could apply for work at a Hyatt and explain to mgmt that you're homeless, those break rooms are tiny homes with a free breakfast, if you pull a double management will possibly toss in a free lunch, no free supper or alcohol though.   Hotel workers and nursing home staff can pull this trick off as well, plus nursing home work will give great medical and dental benefits, even to kitchen and janitorial staff, just be bubbly and explain your situation, it's easier to pull off if you're already buddies with the ADON in nursing and dietary, source: personal experience...  There's vanlife but you'd need a trusty mechanic and a gym membership+PO Box, having a library card and a church to go to would help with some resources and a few free nights of sleeping in the church parking lot, IF they give you permission, and as for free food your options are working at a restaurant and going to a soup kitchen or fast food places...

10lj8ix,,j5xeqic,I have a mailing address, but no working phone and no job
10lj8ix,,j5xfq4e,Technically the no working phone can be resolved easily.   AT&T has a program for people who make under a certain amount, plus certain employers will give you a phone for cheap, the BK I worked at would offer one. An alternative would be to use a service like TextNow, it's free and you don't have to pay for it, but can later on if you like, you can setup a voicemail too, even if you don't have wifi access, it's still a good option, pretty sure there's another service you can use on PC too but the name escapes me, idr if TextNow can do this as I use it on my Android phone.   What kind of perks are you looking for in a job? With food services there's usually free or discounted food and nowadays benefits, I'd suggest dishwasher or dietary aide as they are easier than fast food and you can land a hospital position.  ETA  Hotel and housekeeping on the other hand could free or discounted rooms, DA can but like I said, you gotta be known and liked for that. Plus with the COVID surge, I bet there's a Hyatt or compete or one of it's many competitors hiring, get in good there and you're practically set. The only physically demanding job is general labor, so don't apply through a temp agency, those places should be a last resort.

10libpo,j5x2gt2,,The staff at a shelter should be able to help you with clothes and documents. DV shelters will probably be the most helpful. Hopefully the school district can help with everything else. Are you in a large city or near one?  Get a driver's license as soon as you can, even if you don't have a car and don't want one. An ID will make it easier to apply for assistance, jobs, etc.  I encourage you to do everything you can to stay in school and graduate. Having a high school diploma makes a huge difference in the jobs you can get, especially if you don't already have experience.   Good luck!

Please call the National Runaway Helpline at 1-800-RUNAWAY or go to www.1800runaway.org to find some real resources in your area!  There is a chat feature if you can't call...but there is a real person who can help connect you with shelters and safety. Shelters should be able to help you get your ID paperwork going, help you apply for Medicaid and food stamps, etc. You are also eligible for assistance at school, special considerations for homeless youth. Ask your school counselor or a trusted teacher for assistance. They can get you extra time to complete assignments, extra resources, extra help/tutoring, etc...and will put you in line for scholarships and other assistance. There may be special employment opportunities for you as well...places that work with teens to help them get on their feet.  Please PM me if you need help getting this going. I work at a teen emergency shelter in Kansas, so I may not be able to house you, but I can help you navigate the system!   You don't have to do this alone. There is help out there...and you are worth it. You can do this!
10libpo,j607jfx,,I'm not sure where you are but look up "youth shelters" near you. Most of them tend to be LGBT accepting and they'll help you finish school, go to college, get a job, get your documents, etc. I went through a similar situation at your age
10libpo,j5x59sy,,I mean some religious people are crazy. But some churches, especially the Unitarian or United church ones, are super Protestant and pretty liberal minded.

I could‚Äôve been taken to jail because I didn‚Äôt have my license either. When I told the cop what happened, he let me go. This was in Tampa, FL.

10lhmww,j5xf9p8,,Me and my boyfriend and fallen asleep in our usual place outside a library and a cop came up around 6:30 am and woke us. He asked us to move and his reasoning was "I don't want to see you get in trouble if someone calls us to make you move. You're safe to sleep here at night but once people start moving about around 6 it would be best for you to move."
10lhmww,j5xqvtt,,In my experience, majority are, when treated right. Had more than one cop save my bacon (pun intended.)  The bad one's mostly few. Law enforcement can definitely attract some twisted types too. Gives a lot of authority over other people.   Can immediately recall 3 times police officers did something amazing to help me out and cut me big-time breaks. Am certain I'm forgetting more times.
10lhmww,,j62oahc,I've lived out of vehicles a total of maybe 4 years or more. In that time I had literally hundreds of encounters with cops. Some were understanding and just told me to move on down the road. I'd ask; "Where am I supposed to go?" and the only reply was "anywhere but here" where I patrol. Right, so I'd have the same problem next district over. Other cops were real ballbusters. Bullies who'd jack my ass up like I'm on America's Most Wanted list? My only "crime" was being too poor to afford proper housing. And having a low credit score. And yeah, trespassing or loitering too at that point. But not bothering anyone. Just struggling to survive. Just needed a spot to camp for the night and get some damn rest.
10lhmww,j5y7c65,,I was saved by police 24 years ago by an ex who stabbed me 25x with a screwdriver. They heard me screaming and tried to kick door in when that didnt work they rang the bell the loser went to answer it and immediately got cuffed and put in car. I had many many police, firefighters and ambulence people in my house helping me. Also my dad and uncles were police back then and were very kind. They also helped me 4 years ago when ex husband punched me in the face again when I was leaving. Thats how we ended up in shelter. They bought us food and took us to hotel until we could get in shelter. I thank God for them. ‚ù§Ô∏è

10lhmww,,j62n1yx,It kills me to see that shit happening and I'd like to see more cops taking a stand. I get it's "their job", and they don't want to lose it, but aggressive or abusive sweeps ain't a solution. As a trucker I was often asked to do things I knew would place lives in danger. I refused to comply, even knowing I might get fired and be blackballed from my career. Obviously I can't fault LE for the homeless crisis, but I *can* fault them for how they handle the problem.
10lhmww,j6ec86x,,Most cops are decent I think they are fed up with all the crime, drugs, arson. burglaries that many homeless do. There are 2 homeless men sitting inside a convenience store on the corner its been cold here in AZ at night. Cop behind me in line bought them sodas and coffee.

Turning it on is loud and threatening, so it's a good deterrent. On top of that I'm confident in my ability to use it, and have experience getting tazed.   I also happen to use a cane, it's not really a weapon but it's always nice to have some sort of big stick with you because it can force some distance.
10lh2j6,j67870c,,I have no judgment for anybody who decides that they have to have something to protect themselves on the street.  The first thought that comes to my mind is that I would just try to avoid everybody, but the truth is that that's not always possible.  The number one law of the street, from what my clients tell me, is that most conflicts are resolved with a physical confrontation or intimidation. So if you're behind a business building, and no one else can see, and it comes down to you and one other individual... It's not always easy to know what traumatized people are going to do.  Surviving violence while you are homeless is a skill. I don't think anybody who has a place to live really is equipped to pass any sort of authentic judgment about it.
10lfzhj,j5wv6ap,,Getting back out of it.   I've been homeless to varying degrees most of my adult life. Ranging anywhere from couch surfing, living out of cars and sleeping on concrete.   The hardest part is establishing anything stable enough to believe that homelessness isn't right around the corner again, including the mental aspect.   I find it so hard to trust people not to fuck with things that can bring my precarious house of cards down on my head. Resource guarding when I have literally anything to my name becomes such a feral response.   I've gotten really good at navigating life without stability. I can find food, a place to clean up, and a place to sleep reasonably easily.   But I cannot for the life of me find the ability to trust. Not employers, not landlords, not family, not "friends", not government agencies. I'm so genuinely surprised when anything good goes my way without having to fight tooth and nail for it, and I'm always watching for signs that each of those is about to crumble beneath me.
10lfzhj,,j5xfnr2,Understood.  Trust is very hard to have when you‚Äôve been betrayed by people and just about every other event in your life.  Trusting- means being vulnerable. Vulnerable means you can lose anything and everything at any time, but that‚Äôs where the folly is- fear. It‚Äôs almost like fear of doom becomes self fulfilling.  Maybe live with a healthy fear of danger, but let go of fear that you have no control over.  I guess this applies to me and anyone else that can identify.

10lfzhj,,j5xit9p,> The hardest part is establishing anything stable enough to believe that homelessness isn't right around the corner again, including the mental aspect.  It took me quite a while to adjust to that feeling, after my ex and I finally got off the street and moved into our own place. Like, it didn't feel like *home*, and I couldn't really relax without feeling like the whole thing would turn out to be a dream or something.  It's also been touch-and-go the last couple of years, feeling like I wasn't headed straight back there, and kind of resigning myself to that instead of trying to do everything I could to prevent that.

10lfzhj,,j670e1e,Man I‚Äôve saying the same thing. I‚Äôd been homeless once in my early teens but was lucky enough for a good youth shelter and to have some people around me where I realize now I got out surprisingly easily and fast. Older now and with extreme medical issues. I got dumped and displaced by multiple hospitals- they were literally going to leave me for dead without the literal form of life support I needed to survive. Now I got that but can‚Äôt find a home or stay in a shelter because of all the medical shit (and a medical focused shelter refused me because my illness doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúend date‚Äù. Like hello, wouldn‚Äôt that imply im in even greater need of help than someone who is going to get better?!).   So for me the loss of trust also extends to health care and the fact that im chained to it for the rest of my life to survive. Abusive relationship got me isolated from everyone and the pandemic and just being sick didn‚Äôt help either. That person left me at the worst possible time as I was suffering both medical and housing bullshit. I really wanted to die without them. Knew how fucked I‚Äôd be. They‚Äôre actually one of those folks real well off in a nice home. It‚Äôs fucked.   I knew the world didn‚Äôt give a fuck about me even when I was struggling and paying 95% of my disability check to have a fucking apartment. Pandemic made it clearer still. One good thing I have going for me besides the disability (so an income but not survivable one) is health insurance but all that gets me is therapists who both insist I‚Äôll survive this and solve it then having no clue how to help me. I keep saying even best case scenario where I do find housing and get my life back to something approaching my old normal, i don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll ever survive the complete lack of trust and knowing absolutely no one is going to have my back- not even the fuckers paid to like doctors, hospitals, therapists (I‚Äôve got shitty family. And in my case even if it were different my parents are in their 80s so..)- and knowing I‚Äôll always be a fraction of a step away from exactly where I am now or just outright death.   It makes me so fucking sad how many of us are where we are because of varying degrees of disability and health problems. And it‚Äôs wild since even those rich folks are just an illness or disability away from being one of us.
10lfzhj,j5wzfin,,Being despised by practically everyone for being homeless. There were kind people but it was 90% abuse day in and day out for over 5 years. In the early days I had several people really take advantage of my situation, work me nearly to death and treat me like utter crap.   One woman she worked me 10+ hours 7 days a week in return for sleeping upstairs on a couch in a room filled with construction supplies. I was supposed to have a much better deal but she didn't care. She basically turned me into her personal slave for 3 months until I could find a way out. The people I left her house for weren't much better.   During the time I was homeless I was spat at, insulted multiple times daily, had people outright hate crime me more than once and I had guys constantly trying to prostitute me. I was very lucky I survived it not being raped or worse.   The indignity of it all, being treated like you are subhuman. That's the worst of it for me. I'm housed 18 months now but I still get stuck in the homeless mindset sometimes feeling like everyone I meet just can't be trusted. I'm still very anxious when it comes to anything that could seemingly jeapordize my housing.   I'm no longer physically homeless but in my head part of me still is and might always be. It just lasted too damn long the whole experience. It's marked me for life in a way. I can't walk down the street in NYC and see homeless people and just take it for granted that I'm not.   I actually SEE them, as real people suffering and I know that suffering so it's not easy just walking by. I've fed people, given away clothes and stuff.   I still don't have a lot. I'm living on SS disability but I'm still paying it forward for the good people that did help me. No matter how poor I might feel I know there are people worse off than I am. I try to help a couple of people a month in one way or another even if it's only buying somebody a $4 McDonald's meal deal or a slice of cheese pizza once a month when I get my direct deposit.   The indignity of being homeless that's the absolute worst. Even if you get out you're always looking back and thinking about the cruel stuff that people inflicted upon you. You're always double checking yourself making sure that you're no longer looking or acting homeless. You go out of your way to behave extra normal in a way so that nobody would ever guess you once were yourself.   This is why I'm so honest about having been and openly talk about it, about living on the streets and in shelters. The stigma is still a big thing and non homeless people need to truly understand the experience so they understand why treating homeless people that way is very damaging.   I think it took me a good year of being housed to stop expecting verbal abuse from people. To feel even vaguely normal again. Being homeless it's like you're a scapegoat and an outcast. It's not an easy mindset to let go of.
10lfzhj,,j5x4lkg,Im glad you have housing. I can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôve experienced, you truly have a mark of strength. Anyone who verbally abused you is going to have a hard life. You are clearly such a strong individual, and those people could never even attempt to go through what you went through they are just weak people.  It takes time for the  mind set certain emotions to pass. You are only going up from here. üíú
10lfzhj,,j5yln9w,I‚Äôve been couch surfing with my son (he‚Äôs 32) since my mom passed. Since we lost our house in order for her to be able to live in an assisted living facility, I have been so mindful of the homeless people that I see on the street daily. I try to help when I can, but usually I just talk to them. I doubt anyone even sees them(instead of just looking through them). I have the utmost respect for these people, now that I have been in a similar situation. I haven‚Äôt had to sleep on concrete yet, but at least I have opened my eyes to the plight of these folks and feel blessed that I‚Äôm not quite there. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say without sounding condescending is that I am finally understanding and not judging. All people need to be understood and nurtured.
10lfzhj,,j671iha,>> All people need to be understood and nurtured.   That line hit me like a gut punch. So true. And seemingly so damn simple and yet‚Ä¶ I think we are in especially bad times where the internet gives a lot of pseudo interaction and socialization but so many people are so isolated and alone (was definitely my reality long before finding myself homeless). There‚Äôs people- especially elderly and disabled- who might have the home but are poor in every other way desperate for someone to care and a lot of those folks are just one tiny step away from being out on the streets too. That‚Äôs kind of my story and how I became perfect prey for the abusive relationship that landed me here. And the saddest is knowing even if I could do all over. I couldn‚Äôt have said no to that illusion that someone cared for me. Even if you‚Äôd have told me then how badly they‚Äôd hurt me and leave me with nothing.   I kind of assume a lot of us were in some variation of that even pre-homelessness. You‚Äôre lucky in a sense you at least have had family but family alone clearly doesn‚Äôt keep us from falling into the same places and problems.
10lfzhj,,j61giut,"You're always double checking yourself making sure that you're no longer looking or acting homeless. You go out of your way to behave extra normal in a way so that nobody would ever guess you once were yourself."  This. So much this. I'm housed at the moment, and the people I live with are amazing, but the first couple of months were rough.  I still find myself keeping my possessions condensed, easy to find and easy to pack. Having to explain why I hoard shelf stable food, or refuse to spend money on new clothes when my current ones only have a couple holes.  I was gifted a nice jacket and I still stare at it thinking the design is too loud, draws too much attention. Some of the learned survival behaviors don't seem abnormal to me until someone looks at me weird for it.
10lfzhj,j5woukg,,When people walk up to me and start preaching about Jesus in a frantic fast manner while getting louder and louder. Almost like there yelling in tongues with "Jesus" and "o God" thrown in. While all I can do is watch with my food half in my mouth because I was about to take a bite. They do this until people start staring toward use totally exposing me then they leave abruptly without even throwing a buck at me. Then I have to find a new place to eat.  Tldr: hobo exorcism.
10lfzhj,,j5yg8f0,We have a preacher freak here.   I‚Äôm waiting for the library to open and he‚Äôs ranting about repenting and The Way and then he face-planted.  He did a shot of down and then he went down hard.   EMTs are loading him up now.    Rather than make another comment, I‚Äôll stick my pet peeve in here.   Bathrooms.  I can not find bathrooms.   The usual ones are overrun with people shooting up, and then they pass out.   That shit is getting old.
10lfzhj,j5wsotm,,I'd say it's an equal combination between being isolated and alone, and trying to find a place to sleep and shelter in the winter with the police actively preventing us from doing so. If either of those issues were solved, I could tolerate this existence. I was actually doing okayish before the police cracked down, even on the coldest nights.
10lfzhj,j5wwriv,,The loneliness, personally the worst thing for me is not having an easily accessible shitter. I have IBS so‚Ä¶yeah that definitely sucks. Just gotta get used to popping a squat out in the woods I guess.
10lfzhj,,j5ype81,Was waiting for this answer. Without refrigeration, without homemade food, your stomach is constantly irritated and IBS comes naturally for most.  It's such a nightmare.. having to emergency-poop 3 times a day.. and nowhere to go.
10lfzhj,,j5x2kxj,Honestly, pooping in the woods is kind of comforting, feels natural and can be pretty peaceful
10lfzhj,j5wl4m0,,Agreed. Two individuals, one in a Hummer, other in a Benz got me kicked from my spot. I don't bother anyone. Just chill and charge my phone hoping someone throws acouple bucks my way.
10lfzhj,j5wyssv,,How disgusting and logically inconsistent people are around you.  They   1.) think people who are homeless deserve to be homeless.  2.) think that it's just "so easy" to get out of homelessness - pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  3.) Act like all homeless people are mentally ill.  4.) Refuse to hire the homeless.  5.) Fire the homeless for being homeless.  6.) Say things like "nobody has a right to live" and worse.  I've known way to many people & employers who said all of those things and worse. They'll say that it's easy to get out of homelessness & then advocate for a "final solution" while actively screwing people over.  There are some real nasty characters out there, and they are encouraged by our society in this regard.
10lfzhj,,j672fiy,I find myself mostly sticking to this sub because you don‚Äôt have to look far even online to hear all this shit. I‚Äôve repeatedly stumbled on heavy ‚Äúbootstraps mentality‚Äù over in the poverty finance sub, for example. Makes me want to just scream ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs so damn easy to make money and turn your life around why are you subbed here?‚Äù   My favorite about the ‚Äúnobody has the right to live‚Äù types is how heavily the crossover is between them and the sorts outlawing abortion because a fucking zygote has some sort of ‚Äúright to life‚Äù until they‚Äôre actually born apparently. Or the people who keep trying to take my cat away from me or reported me when I inferred I would off the cat and myself. They didn‚Äôt report or care about me killing myself. Just the cat. And I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt believe a high needs elderly cat who‚Äôs spent her entire existence basically on top of me (developed severe disabilities shortly after adopting her so we have always been together) is going to do too well without the single human she loves and trusts. But animals and fetuses apparently have rights no one extends to their fellow humans.
10lfzhj,j5y8myo,,Mine was no food or food that was awful/borderline inedible.   I developed fear of having no food.   I used to have trouble eating & now I eat all my food way too fast without thinking about it. Usually make myself sick.   I also now hate peanut butter & hardly ever drink water since it was such a pain in the ass to get in my old living situation.   Sidenote:          One time me and my fiance passed a  fellow homeless friend on the side of the road & he had just copped a BUNCH of snacks (mostly sweets & chocolate milk)           I just remember I hadn't eaten for like 3      days when we saw him. Anyways, he blessed us randomly with like hella snacks until we couldn't carry anymore.   I'll never forget that.
10lfzhj,,j72aweh,My brother has a food scarcity issue aswell but for him he hoards food and doesn‚Äôt eat in fear of not having anything one day. We both experienced such brutal forms of homelessness and yes have had to such nasty food. I got a plate of food from a pantry once and it was such nasty rice and ugly potato thing with moldy cookies smashed right in the middle of the meal. I didn‚Äôt think cookies could get mold but this was truly scary.
10lfzhj,j5xep8n,,i hate being alone. that‚Äôs the hardest part for me. i wish i had someone to talk to or someone who could offer me some kind words. i work everyday and i‚Äôm so tired. i wish i had emotional support through one of the hardest things i‚Äôve ever gonna through‚Ä¶ but ain‚Äôt that just the way.

10lfzhj,j5yx6tj,,I agree. Seeing everyone else like that really messes with your head. And then you're asking yourself, "Why am I the only one in this situation?"  Other things that were difficult for me was Sleep, Finding a restroom, and Lack of privacy/personal space.
10lfzhj,j5xjnvz,,Growing up I lived i "at risk of being homelessness" the entirely of my adolescence. When I was 15 the hardest part of being homeless was asking friends if I could take a shower at there house. Regardless of me bringing / using my own towel and hygiene products. When I became homeless again at the age of 20 the hardest part for me was to not steal from Walmart.
10lfzhj,,j72b9eg,Been there. Walmart has everything it‚Äôs hard to not just get what u need. I actually slept in a tent outside a Walmart for a bit
10lfzhj,j5z3ult,,I'd say, as I spent time in kc, fear. I found it hard to be asleep because every little thing would jerk me awake, and I'd constantly move my car because people would stare, and I'd get it in my head that I'd get my windows smashed or otherwise be attacked for being unsightly or something. Getting back to a normal life was drenched in tears.
10lfzhj,j61c2wp,,The hardest part of being homeless is that nobody you know can or will help you out of it. Being homeless is probably one of the most painful experiences I've ever had because people who love and care about you will literally watch as you drown. The second hardest thing is remembering your former life and plans. People who've never experienced homelessness can never even fathom what it feels like.
10lfzhj,,j61hnkj,"Being homeless is probably one of the most painful experiences I've ever had because people who love and care about you will literally watch as you drown."   Cannot agree with this more. Close friends and family would complain that I was asking to use a spare room or couch in their home for any amount of time. The same people who told me countless times they would be there for me if I needed it, that I could call them. It's heart shattering to be treated like a burden for believing them, and teaches us not to trust anyone when they say anything.
10lfzhj,,j61jya0,100% truth. People don't even realize that you're already in tremendous pain, embarrassment, shame, and humiliation. It's the hardest thing in the world to ask for help, especially when you're already carrying those feelings with you. The worst though, I think, is when you do reach out to someone and they say NO. Now you not only have to deal with your shitty new reality, but now you have to add rejection on top of it.
10lfzhj,j5wypnf,,Eh, rich people pissed me off even when I had money. I used to install 7 or 8 giant TVs in a mansion for a family of 4, knowing most of them would be on Fox News most of the time, except the one for the kids' console games.  The hardest part for me is people treating you differently when they realize or find out you're homeless. I'm the same person, who showers roughly as much as before and wears the same clothes, but it's like I turned into a grubby, scraggly, drunk, grizzled gold-prospector-type bugging them for a dollar rather than the person am, standing in front of them right now.
10lfzhj,j5xahl3,,While not as bad as hardly any of these stories, I would say hardest part is disorganization. I live in my car, and when I was in a gym I had my car keys stolen. Then I had my cards stolen the day after (only way I had remotely any money on them was from my job and consistently doing side gigs just to make enough to eat). I can't even claim them stolen due to needing them (using click to pay when I can) because that's the only money I have despite it being a few dollars and no address to get new cards sent to (my bank is out of state). So now it takes me longer to do anything unlocking and relocking them again. Just sucks being so disorganized that I can lose/have things stolen so easily. It's bad enough most of us hardly have anything to begin with.
10lfzhj,j5wnerr,,Once you detach yourself from materialism, you start not to give af about what kind of car people drive or what kind of clothes they wear or what kind of watch they have on or how much money is in their bank account. I know I don't give af. If you were to put a homeless person and the world's richest person in the world in front of me, I'd treat them both the same. Because at the end of the day, we're all human pieces of shits. We all get old, decrepit, and die. I never understood the worshiping and envying of another human piece of shit; especially the worshiping of celebrities and politicians.
10lfzhj,,j5x0voj,cool speech but not the point
10lfzhj,,j5x1nel,OK‚Ä¶ lol I don‚Äôt worship any celebrity. I‚Äôm just saying the system is unjust. I don‚Äôt like seeing people spend $3000 on a handbag when that could afford a place for me to live.
10lfzhj,,j62my5n,How long would that amount allow you to live? Should they stop doing anything for themselves and adopt you instead?
10lfzhj,,j6sici4,No but they should realize their privilege and try to help others. Just being a decent human. Im not asking any one to house and completely care for homeless people by themselves. I only want people to acknowledge the homeless and help in any way they can. Whether it be $20, some food, or just a word of encouragement.
10lfzhj,j5wvt4n,,People looking at you like a bum....I wear the same clothes and it's pretty noticeable at this point. Being sick doesn't help the situation
10lfzhj,j5xcbis,,How people treat you. Whether they ignore you, or have some smart shit to say, or condensed to you. As a 6'5 big guy with a sharp tongue I dealt with this less, but I saw how bad the cops and random people bully the most vulnerable.   Then there's the camping elements, bugs and weather, blisters of your feet, busting your ass to survive everyday.   For me personally though, it was not ending up in jail when some rent a cop or asshole decided it was their day to shine over sitting down somewhere or getting in a trash can.
10lfzhj,j5z4qut,,My family was homeless from 79 to about the first part of 82 and at 13 14 yo the hardest thing for me was dealing with the anger guilt shame and all the other emotions that would creep up. My parents were not very helpful because I guess they were dealing with it too. But I am over most it finally.
10lfzhj,j60g6cy,,The worst part is the way people treat you and look at you.
10lfzhj,j60yhe8,,No address generally means you cannot easily apply for a job or keep the vehicle registration current. Also people are extremely judgemental, not realizing they are more often than not one crisis away from being there themselves. ü§î
10lfzhj,j5zbi1y,,being alone
10lfzhj,j5zj1a2,,i actually do well being homeless. except i do have a 1st gen kia sportage.  for me the hardest part is probably saving money and taking care of myself.  it is difficult to connect with people and explain to everyone that i don't have my own place. everything else i pritty much have figured out or have gotten use to by now.
10lfzhj,j5xopls,,For me it's the police. My city has made homelessness pretty much a crime so I spend more of my time and energy avoiding and dealing with the police than I do anything else.

10lfzhj,j600p16,,For me, the depression and feeling of hopelessness. Also not being able to be clean all the time. As a woman, it feels so horrible not being able to shower at times. The effects on my mental health, I've been a strong woman all my life but this has completely deteriorated my mental health. I try to cope with it. I'll cry at night when my husband is asleep. I break down at random times. I have gone through worse in my life, but this utter feeling of hopelessness is wracking my brain. People stare, say nasty things, we aren't on drugs but are skinny because we can't eat well, and people laugh. Why are people so vile sometimes? I'm a human too.

10lfzhj,j5wv29i,,Can I ask the OP what they expect wealthy people to do? Hand you money? Give you their designer shoes? I was ignored when I was homeless, too, and I was housed. People walk right past most everyone else and pretend they don't exist. Everyone is so wrapped up in themselves that they can't look away long enough to see the rest of the world. If those people make you feel bad, move somewhere else -- maybe someplace where there are people and services who can help you out of homelessness.
10lfzhj,,j5x12m3,you made up an argument and argued with yourself here
10lfzhj,,j5x33gd,No, I seriously want to know what the OP and others on here want wealthy people to do. Would it make a difference if wealthy people acknowledged you on the street?

10lfzhj,,j5x2hv1,I don‚Äôt expect them to hand me cash frankly, because I don‚Äôt believe that they are kind people. You are a human here on earth if you expect to live on earth and not help the earth and the people around you, you‚Äôre just not a good person to me. So the people who are wealthy, and have a the ability to help others and don‚Äôt are just not good people in my opinion I don‚Äôt want their designer shoes lol.    When I was homeless, even if I had five extra dollars, I‚Äôd give it to the homeless person next to me so that they could eat. I don‚Äôt believe you should live on the earth given that it provides you air and not try to give back to the earth and the people who live here. Everyone nowadays just wants to be selfish. How is that going for you? Are you happy?   I am literally a Blackfoot Native American and African American so yeah, I‚Äôm a little upset when rich Europeans are driving Ferraris on my ancestors stolen land built by my ancestors who were enslaved while I sit back, still homeless and they do nothing to help.
10lfzhj,,j5xa5kt,I hear you. But how do you know they they're not helping. I'm not wealthy, and I almost never carry cash that I could hand out. But I support organizations like Feeding America and CitySquare in Dallas. One of my friends and his partner \*are\* wealthy. But they gave close to $40,000 to a local medical clinic that serves the homeless. Another friend who lives in New York talked the other partners in his law firm into covering almost the entire annual budget for a food bank.  I agree that wealthy people, in general, aren't as generous as they could -- or should -- be. But just because they don't hand you cash or don't look you in the eye doesn't mean they aren't doing something to help.
10lfzhj,,j72bkfz,Only thing I can say is there is a lot of people not doing anything.
10lfzhj,j5x0f1m,,The hardest thing was watching people walk their dogs while ignoring actual human beings sitting on the sidewalk on the brink of life and death.  They will spend thousands a year feeding and caring for that dog. They let that animal go home with them and give them a warm place to sleep every night.  That made me research some numbers. Apparently over $100 billion+ a year is spent on the pet industry. Every single year. If that money was instead spent on humans, it would literally not only END homelessness overnight, but also leave enough over every year to put a good quarter of all homeless ppl thru college.  Proof that at the end of the day, humans WILL choose to save other species of animals over their own neighbors. And society embraces this. Our priorities are completely wrong. This is sick and unforgivable on a global scale.  These kinds of thoughts, I wish I never had, because they stick with you forever. I can no longer think of pet owners the same way. I can no longer look at them without a great deal of contempt.  I am 100% sure that one day, poor people will be waiting in line at Emergency Rooms on the same triage list as rich people's dogs in Hospitals, so that rich people's dogs's lives can be prioritized before other poor humans. And everyone will just be "okay" with it. This is the direction society is headed in.
10lfzhj,,j5yir77,I completely disagree with you. No matter how much money people spend on their pets, it's their money to do whatever they want with. They don't owe you anything and it's not their fault you're in the position you're in. Sorry to be harsh but it's the truth.
10lfzhj,,j5yqedh,>it's their money to do whatever they want with.  This is correct. And every single day, they make the decision to use that money to feed, house, and medically care for a dog, instead of a desperate human on the brink of death literally in the same town they live in. I am genuinely ashamed for them as humans.  That is ethically unforgivable.
10lfzhj,,j5zf2bk,Or spend the money on like‚Ä¶ an Xbox. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre harping on dogs.
10lfzhj,,j5zblz4,Okay, people have tried to be decent to you. But you‚Äôre being purposely obtuse. It‚Äôs not the job of anyone to pay your way. For you to judge and be shitty about ALL people with dogs? What a stupid hill to die on. Would you want all homeless people to be prejudged? I doubt you would.   On that note, I‚Äôd better go buy more golden water dishes and cashmere dog sweaters. Since that‚Äôs apparently all you think dog owners are good for.   *idiot üôÑ*
10lfzhj,,j5zfor3,You don't speak for anyone but yourself.  I'm allowed to have an opinion. I completely understand ppl who are selfishly in denial of the results of their actions.
10lfzhj,,j5y38pg,So you‚Äôre essentially prejudging anyone walking a dog? This is such a lame take. My dog is a therapy dog, but I guess I‚Äôm an asshole for sheltering/feeding him?   I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt like all homeless being painted with one brush. So why do the same to dog owners?
10lfzhj,,j5ybcs9,Yes. In a time when humans are dying from neglect, hunger, and cold outside in our own cities, it is cruel and ethically unforgivable to choose to spend resources on a dog.  Completely unforgivable.  Something inside of me, can never look at them the same way again. their behavior is the absolute peak of hypocrisy and cruelty.  There are a lot of behaviors I've learned to forgive in humans... but this hypocrisy when other people's lives are at risk right there in front of your eyes.. I just can't man. They lose all respect in my eyes.  I get that everyone is a little bit selfish and a little bit ignorant.. but if that's what someone does with their extra income, they better not ask for help from other humans ever again. When they get old and end up in a nursing home? Let their dogs wipe their butts for them and change them and cook their meals and drive them to doctor's appointments, since they helped them so much. F that.
10lfzhj,,j5yuvei,I completely disagree with you. Human beings domesticated dogs, taking away their ability to live in the wild. Because of that we have an obligation to care for them.
10lfzhj,,j612aw8,>taking away their ability to live in the wild.  you mean exactly what we did to domesticated humans by making it illegal to hunt or fish without expensive licenses and limits, by fencing off natural water sources, and making it illegal to dig or build shelter without paying a ton of money for land?  It's the EXACT same thing. And as humans, we have a responsibility to help other humans first, before taking on other species of animals for crying out loud.
10lfzhj,,j5yq0fq,Yeah. You clearly just don‚Äôt get it. I hope you‚Äôre able to get beyond your judgmental pettiness one day.  I‚Äôd definitely prefer my dog in elder years than be looked after by people who think like you. So no worries there üôÑ
10lfzhj,,j5zd6mu,Ok. hope you dog takes good care of you, goes shopping for you, makes you meals, changes you, wipes your butt, drives you to doctors appointments, and launders your clothes when you can't do any of those things for yourself anymore..  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10lfzhj,,j5x3nz2,I totally understand. This doesn‚Äôt have to do with pets, but I thought I‚Äôd share. I was homeless in a pretty big city and I was sitting on the sidewalk downtown, waiting for the bus with my brother. A family was walking on the sidewalk and they had all just gotten some ice cream. All of them had ice cream cones, and there was this black man laying in the middle of the sidewalk on his side. I guess he was sleeping‚Ä¶he was literally skin and bones. Not a single piece of fat on him it‚Äôs possible he wasn‚Äôt sleeping. And the family just walked right past him like he was a dried piece of gum on the concrete no acknowledgment at all. If that was a dog, that family would‚Äôve acted completely differently.
10lfzhj,,j60wlkb,What did you expect them to do? Why does it matter he was black?
10lfzhj,,j729mn0,That‚Äôs a dumb question. That man‚Äôs ancestors built the cities we live in today. Y‚Äôall can keep pretending slavery didn‚Äôt exist. Black lives and communities are affected by systemic racism‚Ä¶.Black Lives Matter.? Are you living under a rock smh. Average white family in the US makes $125,000 a year. Average Black family makes $17,000. I expect them to ask if the man was ok. Maybe offer some food or let him use the phone to call anyone. He could have been dead. If there was a dog laying down in the middle of the sidewalk looking like it was unconscious would you do something. You Probably won‚Äôt because humans have more empathy to pets than actual people. Just think before asking a dumb question. I should even have to say this. If you don‚Äôt care about fellow humans your not a good person. You don‚Äôt just walk over a helpless human with an ice cream cone in your hand and pretend it‚Äôs a bug. Homeless people are treated terribly because people like you don‚Äôt care about the world around. Selfishness isn‚Äôt gonna get help your spirit.
10lfzhj,,j72gymg,You seem angry. My point is that the person you spoke of is human. It truly doesn't matter that he was male or black. You yourself "guessed he was sleeping". Did you check on him? Be the change you wish to see. Passing judgement on others isn't gonna help your spirit.
10lfzhj,j87djqu,,hiding it from my job is going to be a little bit difficult
10lbukk,j5w2v5r,,No shower, no good sleep, no clean clothes, time to find food, no where safe to keep my things while working, transportation between food, sleep, & work
10lbukk,,j5x0axr,I was *extremely* lucky when I first became homeless, in that I already had a full-time job, funnily enough in a thrift shop, so new/clean clothes weren't an issue when I could buy a whole outfit for like <$10. The only real issues for me on your list were showers and sleep. Showers, I'd either have to bird-bath in a public toilet or, rarely, used a co-worker's shower if I slept over after a party. Sleep was a bigger problem because I slept on a blanket over concrete; I was in the suburbs and couldn't really camp out, and I didn't want to draw attention to where I laired, from fear of other homeless people and the authorities.  Otherwise, food wasn't an issue because the suburban area I lived in had like 4 or 5 grocery stores within walking distance; I carried everything I owned in a military-sized/style backpack (a co-worker offered to take care of my roll-on luggage containing other stuff) and work was a relatively quick walk from where I 'lived'.  After that I was also very lucky in having a homeless veteran advocate who essentially got me a "friend of a friend" reference for a couple of jobs. I couldn't imagine the frustration and nightmare of trying to get a job on my lonesome without that kind of luck and support.
10lbukk,j5w3l6c,,Seattle has a large homeless population. The average rent here in Seattle is usually above $1,500. Minimum wage in Seattle is around $19 per hour. Sales tax in Seattle area is above 10%.   Once you do the math and consider the process of getting a rental apartment (background check, credit score, employment verification, sometimes you‚Äôll also need a reference letter), you‚Äôll know that having a job really does not guarantee you a place to live.  I know your question is why homeless people don‚Äôt have a job, but I guess the second half of your question is ‚Äúget a job to stop living on the street‚Äù. Apologies if this is not your subconscious intention.
10lbukk,,j5wlkpy,Good observations, I did not notice this at first to be honest.   The OP comes off as really nice, but when you really "read between the lines" of his or her question, you can get to the root of what they are really doing here... How sad...  Anyways, my question is wtf??? A reference letter to need a rental apartment? It is a different world over there!
10lbukk,,j5wyymb,I agree with you about the OP. It sounds curious, but all the answers are really obvious for a little bit of 'awareness'. The social supports are not really there for people who need help. If they did, people could get back up and move on with life. Nobody wants to be poor and distressed.
10lbukk,,j5wze8o,I recently studied the process of getting a trailer in WA. The system, I would say, is pretty fucked up.

10lbukk,,j6082tu,You do get studios for less than 1000$. Some being even close to 500$ assigned specifically for low groups but they would need you to be employed and capable of supporting yourself or you would need a Co-Guarantor.  Not sure how big a factor is credit score in getting apartments but even the above apartments ask for one.
10lbukk,,j60emqa,Thank you!
10lbukk,j5w7fl9,,i had multiple jobs while i was homeless, but none of them lasted very long just due to not having consistent shower access or transportation to work.
10lbukk,j5wdcmx,,I would love to have a job. I am inhibited from getting one by the following factors: 1. I have physical and mental disabilities that prevent me from working pretty much any job I would be otherwise qualified for, at least at any remotely competitive level that would allow me to keep said job. 2. I have a dog and belongings that I have nowhere to put safely while I'm at that job. 3. While not a factor keeping me from getting a job per se, it's important to note that there's hardly a job out there that I could stand a chance of getting that pays enough to get me out of homelessness.

10lbukk,j5wiykm,,Ooo great question I was homeless with my sibling for a year and a half and throughout my homelessness I had a lot of random people shout at me to just get a job while I was trying to fly a sign to ask for money for food that day.  I was homeless in a lot of different situations, homelessness for everyone looks different. For me I was sleeping on concrete, I have also slept in shelters, in hotels and I had my own tent/campsite near some homeless resources. People assume that homelessness is often a result of laziness or drug abuse.   I was homeless with my sibling because we were born from an extremely abusive family, from about the age of 15, we were living with different people‚Ä¶in and out of homes, so we didn‚Äôt experience a stable living situation for most of our adolescence.  Neither of us abuse drugs, and we are actually extremely motivated people however, given our abusive childhood, we did struggle from mental issues and also I have a physical disability (Scoliosis). So given things like physical pain and mental issues, such as PTSD that makes it harder to work for even a normal person.    When I was homeless, I struggled to eat sufficient meals. Sometimes I also struggled to find a place to wash myself properly, and I stunk a lot of the time. During the time that I slept on concrete, I didn‚Äôt sleep much at all and I started getting very intense sleep deprivation issues. I believe in order to work a job you need basic human necessities, such as a place to bathe, place to sleep and food. Now these are things that you can get from living in a shelter but often times people in shelters have to be kicked out in 30 days because it‚Äôs temporary housing. You could also be in a shelter with a lot of other people and again you‚Äôre not sleeping well, maybe you‚Äôre not eating well and maybe the environment as a whole could be triggering for you.   Both of my shelter experiences were very triggering because I was born from an awful family that also abused drugs, so seeing people in the shelter abusing drugs, and talking about it was not a comfortable place for me. Both times I lived in shelters I got sick a lot and I was harassed by men in the shelter as well.   One thing that is so important to understand is that most homeless people especially those in brutal homeless situations are just trying to figure out how to survive. They are thinking about what they are going to eat next and where they are going to sleep for the night. Being in that state of mind is survival mode. You cannot focus on any other task but surviving, so a job is not important at all. Jobs are for people who have basic human necessities or rather, I should say basic human rights. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize that when you apply for a job, you need to put down an address to receive mail at & some people don‚Äôt even have an address that they can get mail at.   Another note is that a lot of jobs don‚Äôt pay you enough to even afford housing, especially in very populated areas housing is extremely expensive. Going and getting a job at say Walmart or maybe a fast food chain is not going to be able to support your rent. Even people who aren‚Äôt homeless and are working jobs are struggling to pay their rent. Minimum wage jobs require 40 hours a week at least to be able to begin to afford a place. And to do so it would take a few months of saving money. I‚Äôm talking about minimum wage jobs because they‚Äôre are the most accessible and don‚Äôt require many skills. If you‚Äôre going to get a job that‚Äôs higher paying they‚Äôre likely going to deny your application if you do not have a place to live. Another huge factor of working is literally getting to work. Transportation like buses in a lot of cities can be expensive or simply does not exist. Riding a bike can also be very difficult to do if you have a physical issue or your work is very far away.  (I was only 19 years old when I became homeless and I‚Äôm almost 21 now and I still don‚Äôt have a job due to my PTSD and spinal pain. My housing isn‚Äôt stable either. I‚Äôm currently trying to get SSI income and it feels impossible. Takes forever. If I am approved it‚Äôs only $900 a month that‚Äôs still not enough for housing where I live.)   Many homeless people are disabled.
10lbukk,j5xas1x,,I watch my partner‚Äôs dog while they‚Äôre at work, but I‚Äôm disabled to the point where I can‚Äôt work
10lbukk,j5wvreb,,The primary problem with your question OP is that it completely ignores the fact that a huge number of homeless people *have* jobs. Your question is rude or judgy because of the assumption.
10lbukk,,j5xpspc,I don't think it was rude of me to assume minimum wage in your country is high enough to afford shelter.
10lbukk,,j6axqc7,minimum wage is only enough to get a house if you have zero other expenses and are able to work overtime (40+ hours) every week and even then you can just outright be denied housing because there are not as many places to live as people who need places to live

10lbukk,,j60x3zm,Out of curiosity: Do you not want to try lying on a resume because you fear legal action or is it for moral reasons?
10lbukk,,j60y9gp,moral reasons
10l9y24,j5vpu2i,,I mean, california and Oregon are chock full of homeless people who have plugged up the waiting lists and drained resources to the extent that ol Gavin Newsome pushed a law that allows police to commit homeless people against their own will. So, yeah,  MN might totally suck, especially in winter, but it's a different kind of awful on the West coast. Not saying don't go, just saying don't expect things to be easier, just different.
10l9y24,,j5vrzei,This is true.  Portland is planning to ban unsanctioned camping and establish sanctioned campsites.  People are fed up with the camps, crime and addicts.
10l9y24,,j5z5z2q,THUS SOLVING THE PROBLEM FOREVER
10l9y24,,j61ms7j,I mean, yeah, back when the camps were in parks, in industrial areas, among trees or tucked by roadways it wasn't too big a deal. Then they moved to poorer neighborhoods along the sidewalks.  Now they're on the sidewalks in neighborhoods where kids and those with mobility issues have to walk into the street to get around them.   Its going to end in an ugly way when a person gets hit by a car because they couldn't use the sidewalk. Unfortunately the hate is getting put on the homeless instead of on the cities for not providing a camping space. We've got no shortage of open spaces and abandoned lots. City doesn't want the liability of letting the homeless camp there but when some kid gets run down because they can't use the sidewalk (and for some goddammit reason the kids in my town can't walk in a single line, it's just a blob of six to ten taking up the whole sidewalk) well, the city will start talking about mental illness and drug abuse but it's a housing issue. Long term, more housing needs to get made, short term, cities need to designate spaces for camping.
10l9y24,,j61wg74,No, it's more than that.  Oregon decriminalized small quantities of drugs; the homeless soared, and crime escalated.  It all happened in a short period of time.  You cannot drive around anywhere without seeing tents and people zoned out.  Portland has a drug, untreated mental illness and cartel problem. It is dangerous to be homeless there and long timers (both housed and unhoused) are sick of it.
10l9y24,,j675aoa,Jesus, what a nightmare.  Here's hoping the best for you guys.
10l9y24,,j6ogyeg,And provide porta potties too.
10l9y24,,j6pw2tv,That's just basic hygiene. When they made the camps for covid, they had pump sinks, portapotties, and dumpsters. I don't know why they couldn't keep that going.

10kpw0n,,j6gh9nu,Word up. Yeah, definitely it's all about the balance there. I am a coffee drinker, so to get my pH up I love to just douse things in lemon. If I'm not feeling well though I'll switch to water..  Power to you family. It's hard for the ones who are really about it. Bless
10kpw0n,,j6gic9e,Sorry to hear. I had my gallbladder removed at like 15 years ago. Grew up super poor and rough so junk food was default. Didn't have control over that. So my biggest issue was how my intestines would react. For me apple cider vinegar and biotics (pro & pre) help. I'll generally avoid lactose and beans although if I feel like it whatever plus hit or miss. Pizza is one of my faves. But we all do whatever we do. Bless you too üëç
10kpw0n,,j6g9mxu,I don't combine them. There's benefits to apple cider vinegar. I actually hardly buy water and alkaline tastes better that's all I care about lol. Regardless this is just about my purchases not here giving nutritional advice üëç
10kpw0n,,j5u5rse,Cherry chips? How did those taste? I‚Äôm struggling to imagine how that would work.
10kpw0n,,j6g4si8,Weird especially because combined with BBQ. It was like combining a meal and dessert in one item which is randomly intriguing idea. Wouldn't recommend it. Only reason I ate half the bag was because I was trying to figure it out. Was confusing my mind lol.
10kpw0n,,j5s9ypq,Walmart?
10kpw0n,j5vvm2x,,Awesome! Enjoy!
10kpw0n,,j6fhw0b,Thanks üëç What would you buy?
10kpw0n,j5sfoqh,,Times like that, I like to get a couple packs of sushi from the deli cold case.  I always secretly hope I'm in front of one of those AM radio listeners who judges you for EBT purchases being "too fancy" then follows you out to the parking lot to make sure your car looks poor enough.
10kpw0n,,j5snm1d,I don't recall anyone ever talking down to me while checking out and using my ebt.  But then again I am hearing impaired and don't pay any attention to what's not in front of me.
10kpw0n,,j5t5bhf,I always use self checkout.
10kpw0n,j5t8dw0,,Can you buy fast food with it?
10kpw0n,,j5unhb2,No, you cannot buy fastfood with SNAP/EBT. You can buy pretty much anything from the grocery store with a nutritional label though, aside from hot meals or alcohol.
10kpw0n,,j5wfvb6,look out for cold meals that say "hot" because one time i wanted to buy a lobster that was in the cold seafood section. turned out after trying to cash out, my EBT didn't accept it because it was labeled as "hot" food, even though it was cold and cooked the day before.
10kpw0n,,j6g8pfm,Interesting. Good heads up. Never came across that because rotisserie chickens are good to go. Along with any cold food in deli even obviously cooked before.
10kpw0n,,j6g8v7d,Just found out can buy protein powder as long as has nutritional label instead of supplement.
10kpw0n,,j6xvhkb,In some states you can literally buy KFC with food stamps. In Florida a few months ago they allowed all hot food too for a short period.
10kpw0n,,j5wmz6q,Call your local EBT office and see if your state participated in the hot foods endorsement. I know they have here in California but not sure if they have it anywhere else.
10kpw0n,,j6g8eyi,Yup few states do for sure.
10kpw0n,,j6g8cen,In a few states you can at some places or something similar to that.
10kpw0n,,j6g912d,Another thing you can is buy off Amazon (it'll say EBT eligible and they've even got specific section on there).
10kpw0n,j5s8z3f,,Some sh\*thead nimby is gonna find this and repost it as "look what homeless people are buying with their EBT!"  F\*\*k 'em, keep it up!
10kpw0n,j5snhm4,,That's an incredible amount.  They really raised it during covid.  I just got a letter that mine is being decreased but without telling me how much.  I usually buy enough food to last me 2 to 3 months, mostly frozen dinners from trader joe, and keep some eggs and milk for breakfast.  I also try to save mine up.  I get like $260/month during covid and around $200 without.  So I will spend like $100/month and save up till I have around $800 to 1,000.
10kpw0n,j5tnq2p,,When I had ebt I was given $40 every month
10kpw0n,,j6g86jc,Definitely can vary a ton obviously depending on what you make and what state you're in. From what I can tell Nevada is as good as it gets.
10kpw0n,,j6g8dgv,Migrated from nh to nj
10kpw0n,j5vfmg5,,Enjoy :)   Growing up, the only time we could get crab legs (my favorite food) was when it was on sale and we had food stamps. Never feel guilty for feeding yourself.
10kpw0n,,j6fjem0,Grew up on every government assistance with 9 of us total. Definitely get what you're saying ü§≤
10kpw0n,j5wgdx4,,Sorry to ask but how did you know if you were eligible for EBT? I‚Äôm homeless too with only $60 right now. I tried online to see if I was but it asked for annual household income and I‚Äôm unemployed right now so idk what to put for that. I‚Äôm at the end of the line right now I really don‚Äôt even want to be here anymore ngl. Any tips or any Info would be nice thank you
10kpw0n,,j5wmcnr,Your annual household income would be $0 as you are not working.  They do expect you to report any other money you get over a certain amount, here in California.  You‚Äôd more than qualify and could have SNAP the same day as your intake, as it would be an emergency need based off your income/living situation.   As long as you have no stocks/bonds, property and/or foreign accounts, you‚Äôd be more than eligible.  I‚Äôm pretty sure it was $250 per adult here in cali with no income.   I would encourage you to Google your states online portal and get started on the application.  They may even be a viable resource for other helpful resources.
10kpw0n,,j6f6vp1,Exactly. Get around $375/month in Nevada so not complaining.
10kpw0n,,j5xhqxs,While you are facing all the anxiety of social services, try finding local food banks.
10kpw0n,,j6f6zz1,Yup that's how I got by while I didn't have it plus dumpster diving.
10kpw0n,,j6f6aj5,Comment below is great. Put $0 and answer everything else in a manner that makes you appear as poor as possible such as own nothing, $0 in all accounts. You should be able to specify you're living in shelter/temp housing or very least you pay nothing for lodging. Also I applied at homeless shelter (Las Vegas) for both EBT and Medicaid. They've got government workers who show up daily and you apply on and get cards on the spot. If not go online or show up at DHS.
10kpw0n,j5x9y4l,,It's nice to have, but just remember there are a lot of hungry people here on the forums that are pretty hard up. Not asking you to share it around, just saying it's kinda rubbing it in other people face's.
10kpw0n,,j6f3puu,Sure, but I went 4 months without and dumpster dived. Not my intention so feel most people won't take it that way hopefully. I'm always here to give suggestions regarding how to get food. Hope all is well.
10kpw0n,j5xh6aa,,Hey ....have fun with your daily food selections.  Try some nuts and apples.  Keeps you regular.
10kpw0n,,j6f3cx0,Thanks üëç Had some almonds other day and have blueberries almost everyday. Thankfully no issues being regular. Although can pose some issues since bathrooms can be tough to access at times lol.
10kpw0n,j5y8ec1,,So yummy and healthy! So glad for you!!
10kpw0n,,j6f2lt6,Thanks ü§û Definitely gonna take advantage of excess to explore higher quality. What food suggestions do you have?
10kpw0n,,j6fkgmz,I saw the photo of the snap balance. What amount do you get monthly? Do you have a place where you can store anything or is it all on you?  If you have a Trader Joe‚Äôs or a Fresh Thyme or An Aldi I would buy some whole food items or even from Dollar Tree or Dollar Type stores and buy dehydrated fruits, nuts, seeds try to stick to healthier choices to keep you healthy. I happen to love peanut butter and rice cakes and protein drinks. It is ideal if you can make sure you are getting at least 60 grams of protein per day. Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit.  You will feel better if you eat the Whole Foods. Best wishes.
10kpw0n,,j6fv5r4,Las Vegas is spot I'm most settled in so Nevada gives me around $375 per month. I'm in Chicago temporarily for now. Area I operate in had a Target and local chain called Jewel-Osco so I shop daily because don't wanna carry much around. Walmart and Dollar Tree are my go-to, but too outta the way. Appreciate suggestions. I'm actually a former top level athlete who wrestled and played football in college. Definitely about protein (at least try for over 200 grams per day) although I'm type who just kinda eats whatever. Never followed a specific way of eating.  Can't cook anything except use hot water from Panera Bread for ramen which I'll dice up some hotdog or sausage into. Location I use is one of few without microwave. So protein bars, protein shakes, jerky, turkey and chicken sausage, beef hotdogs, blueberries, hardboiled eggs are healthier stuff I go for plus whatever else I crave whether red velvet muffins, chips or whatever else can imagine.
10kpw0n,,j6gq8j4,Getting a lot of protein in is very good. I think you are making great choices for food. Try to stay warm and out of the cold. It is chilly in the Midwest.
10kpw0n,j5u5g1y,,Over Covid when they were giving extra and because I‚Äôm disabled and wasn‚Äôt really going out I built up a big balance like that (was also in IL. Props to them for being one of the more generous EBT states as a whole. Ended up displaced in MI when my shit fell apart and have had a lot of issues getting benefits over here). It was so nice to be able to treat myself.   Lord knows it‚Äôs been such an awful time in the world as a whole, and for us in this sub worse still. It‚Äôs good to get a win now and again.
10kpw0n,,j5wmspj,You do know that you‚Äôre able to use your card in another state, right?  As long as the store accepts SNAP benefits, you can use your EBT card pretty much anywhere.  I know here in California they started the hot meal program with EBT, meaning if one was unable to cook hot meals, they could call and get a hot meal enforcement and use it at selected fast food spots and grocery stores for hot meals/sandwiches.
10kpw0n,,j6g5i9w,Yup got mine in Nevada (Las Vegas) and temporarily in Illinois (Chicago). I've heard about that program in Cali. Only few states have it I believe. Awesome if ever got to experience it. My treat is 711 pizza üëç
10klofn,j5rics3,,I‚Äôve been in your exact position I have no friends or family either and been homeless multiple times especially recently a few weeks ago. It is a scary situation do you have a car you can sleep in?
10klofn,,j5rj0ck,No, I dont. And I am a woman on west coast. I hear human traficking is bad. I'm lonely. I'm so lonely
10klofn,,j5rjn2n,Be careful of anyone offering you housing in exchange for other things, this is a sneaky way men traffic women because by definition trafficking is when the victim is offered housing and money and transportation in exchange for something else. This has happened to me 3 times now. Please be careful being homeless puts you in a very vulnerable situation
10klofn,,j5rjqsf,I just want to be happy, everything feels so dark
10klofn,,j5rk07j,I‚Äôve been in your exact position so ur not alone. I suggest going to a shelter for girls how old r u op?
10klofn,,j5rk425,I'm 18 shelters bad can't find one that is sustainable been in 3 different states i am disliked
10klofn,,j5rkwyw,I was homeless at ur age too. Also am disliked everywhere I go because narcs surround me constantly. There are a few things you can do you could try to find an empty unlocked room at a hotel and try not to get caught, you could also panhandle for money for a hotel room or buy a storage unit and buy a mattress and heater
10klofn,,j5rl230,Narcs, the narcs are so bad
10klofn,,j5rlk5n,They really are best way to go about it is ignore them completely also shelters are dangerous sometimes depending on who is there so be careful
10klofn,,j5rlp36,The workers are narcs. I keep getting stuck in small towns
10klofn,,j5sinpt,I was homeless as a barely legal adult too.   I also had a friend who knew someone who promised to let me sleep on there couch in exchange for cleaning and to let me eat in exchange for cooking. Turns out they didn‚Äôt know them as well as they said and chose acquaintance poorly. I ended up basically a slave and the conditions were terrible. I won‚Äôt go into specifics as I don‚Äôt want you to think I am trying to frighten you but I do want you to know to be cautious.   It was a family and the kids living at home were around my age, some slightly older and slightly younger etc. you wouldn‚Äôt have thought it would go on but it did. Was an absolute hellscape. Beaten. Raped. Among other things.   Just be careful. It‚Äôs normal to feel alone. In my own loneliness I clung to the first bit of seeming kindness and that turned out to be a mistake. It isn‚Äôt always but that shit happens a lot.   Focus on what you can do to survive and try to spend some time at a library if you can. Spent a little time, even if it feels pointless, reading something you like or talking to other people your own age.   Accept help if you find it trustworthy but make sure it‚Äôs legit twice and thrice before you do lest it be a trap. It‚Äôs always when you don‚Äôt expect it and didn‚Äôt do that when someone gets you.   You are not even close to being alone but I know very well it feels soul crushing. There is an end and it will get better.
10klofn,,j5ufj0x,Thank you for this, and the advice about the lonliness. Indeed it is soul crushing.
10klofn,,j5ujiz7,It is.   Heads up. It can be surreal at times, or at least it was for me, to listen to others my age with entirely different worries and understandings of the world and how society works etc. To be fair I had that problem beforehand because of abuse and my situation in the first place after my mom died so I can‚Äôt say for sure but if you do experience it then it‚Äôs normal when you‚Äôve got such different experience. Still better to socialize and still detrimental not to.   If you need resources librarians also have a knack for knowing them. If they don‚Äôt know they know where to find it sometimes better than 211, depending on the librarian.  Edit: surreal
10klofn,,j5row5f,Where about west coast? I'm Eastern WA
10klofn,,j5rpd6g,Where on the west coast?  Here in Frisco things are tough. I'm just a young guy. I can't imagine what it's like day to day for women in most places.   If quality of life is what you need there is more money going around in Frisco, it is only just barely better but when it does count for something it's nice.   Being in hotter cities just means more homeless people and especially more chronic homeless people.   Do you have anyone in the shelter pushing to get you a place? Are there programs for that in your city.  The rumor I've heard is that atleast in Frisco, they coordinate rental assistance for certain people in the shelter.   I still will not go near the place because the rumor also is that it takes months and months, sometimes a year or more.
10klofn,,j5sge63,Thats ME.  Homeless No FAMILY  NO FRIENDS .  NO ONE. ALL ALONE IN MY VEHICLE  BROKE AND HUNGRY MOST TIMES.  DAMNN. .    THIS LIFE IS BRUTAL .  A LIVING HELL
10klofn,,j5v5s1f,I don't know your circumstances but i'm also alone. Sometimes i hint or openly say i'm homeless to get a reaction. They can't even understand how i can be homeless because i look normal. Some wealthy former neighbors and close or distant acquaintances stopped talking to me when i told them i'm in my car or when i lost my job, became disabled, unable to work. Not even offered a room or any help, even though they are more than capable of helping. In the past when i was housed it was always them asking me for help or hinting they needed help and i offered to help with whatever they needed. But it was a homeless foreigner who offered me help when i didn't need it. Some are even happy that i'm down and they want to finish me just because i exist. I'm not hungry and not out on the street but it's a possibility. I try not to talk about my situation with strangers. I have no friends or relatives. Homelessness is criminalized everywhere.
10klofn,,j5v6u75,I am Homeless 100% .  In my vehicle . I park it and sleep in a parkinglot.. Zero Help . Zero money . Zero Friends. Zero family.. Left for dead .

I have back problems and highblood preassure Anxiety.   Last money i had i paid vehicle insurance and cell phone , Gasoline.   Money ran out. Now im  Completely fucxxked .   Its cold . Im hungry .  Pray for me everyone reading.  Thanks .
10klofn,j5s1tz9,,Hello,   I saw your post and it broke my heart seeing so many young people struggling. I hope things get better. I'm sorry I can't help you much because I'm homeless too freezing outside. My heart is with you and wishing you the best.  Best,   Emma ( Katie)
10klofn,j5so4uz,,Shelter life sucks. It's demeaning and it's stressful and people in shelters treat you like crap. Staff, residents, it doesn't matter. You will always run into people ready and willing to give you a hard time.   That being said it can also be the best road towards your ending being homeless. I speak from personal experience. I'm typing at you from Affordable Housing, from a mini studio in Manhattan that I am not paying anything like the going rate for.   I was homeless for 5 years plus. I'm legally disabled and middle aged. I tried everything on my own. Until I went into the system and learned to work with it, to use it to my benefit nothing worked.   I spent like 3 years of the 5 in a really bad shelter in Brooklyn. They totally abused me and were no real help at all. In fact they tried to stand in my way when a better shelter offered me a place and real help with housing. I finally got out and transferred to another one but they made it very hard.   I did finally get housing but if I had stayed in shelter #1 I'd likely still be stuck there waiting. They had people there 5 years. They were far more invested in keeping people living there than in helping them to get housed. Shelter #2 did in less than one year what Shelter #1 hadn't done in almost 3.   Before that I was street homeless for almost a year and a half and it literally nearly killed me. I ended up hospitalized and nearly died from blood clots and pulmonary embolisms.   Being homeless on the street is a one way ticket to dying for a lot of people. It's hard as hell to get out and stay out but it can be done. If you're young enough, healthy and willing to work hard you'll find it a lot easier so long as you don't get sidetracked by depression and chemicals.   If you are not, expect your road to being ex-homeless to be a lot harder. If you are a woman you do NOT want to stay street homeless. Even the often brutal life in a shelter is preferable to being taken advantage of and you will face that no matter what age you are if you are a woman.   Something like 2/3 of the women that I shared a dorm with were abused in some way by men while homeless. Physically, sexually, mentally it was almost inevitable. Many women ended up broke,  addicted and prostituting themselves just to stay alive. They were prey even to other homeless, particularly the men they would meet who would try to turn their situation to their advantage.   Going into the NYC shelter system in the end it saved my life. Did I enjoy it? Hell no but it led to the way out.   I'm 18 months housed. Things can still be tough in terms of health and finances sometimes but I'm mostly doing okay. Was it worth it? Yeah. I still have flashbacks of stuff that happened while homeless sometimes but I'm proud to say that I made it out and I'm holding steady.   3 out of 5 single people that end up becoming homeless will end up back being homeless. It's a brutal cycle. It's very hard to get out and stay out of being homeless once you fall into it. There is a lot that will get in your way during the journey out but the biggest thing that can block you is YOU.   Homeless people can be their own worst enemies sometimes. They're resistant to accepting help. They put up mental roadblocks refuse to do things that can help them get out. Believe me I know. I did it myself for far too long and it kept me homeless for far longer than I needed to be.   I'm not judging anyone. I'm just telling you what it's like and that it's a valid way out, the whole shelter thing. As unpleasant as it is it may be what gets you out finally so don't just discount it just because you think you will hate it. Of course you will. The shelter system is designed to make it so unpleasant so you will want to work and get the hell out but there are real opportunities that can come out of finally going into one if you are willing to try.   I'm living proof of that and that it can be done. Easily? No, never. Unpleasant? Definitely. But it worked for me in the end and I'm very grateful to NYC and it's shelter system for that. As brutal as it was it worked.  I'm OUT.   My #1 priority is staying out.   That's just it.
10klofn,,j5v9r8n,You sound awesome. That is all.
10klofn,j5rgrv8,,Shelters have bed bugs
10klofn,,j5rh1du,I dont know what to do anymore
10klofn,,j7mqhug,I was so lucky two 5ish month stays at one shelter and 3 weeks at another and no bed bugs. Some shelters have big hot boxes and require all clothing is washed and all clothing and belongings go through the hot box. Had one scare but it wasn't a bed bug.
10klofn,j5s5vs4,,Get a job in a restaurant or as a janitor maybe.  It's not glamorous but these jobs are desperate for people and they pay enough to rent out a room somewhere. I've been jobless for months now and am looking at options myself. I am barely hanging on to my apt but I might be renting out my rooms and sleeping on the couch while working as a janitor if I can't find a better job.
10klofn,j5u2vys,,Start chasing your case manager to get you into a transitional shelter. If you have to be an addict, smoke some weed or drink alcohol & then get tested. F'ed up but sometimes that's the only way to get in. Only a step better but they're more willing to get you into housing..... Also depression or PSTD
10klofn,,j5u52xt,Nope none of that works I have PTSD among other things and on top of that I'm guessing they are making big money off the substance abuse program. I am in a LEGAL state and they said that "because we found marijuana in your pee test, your probably using something else too." But with no evidence only thing i used is mary jane in a LEGAL STATE. It was also only 15 NANO GRAMS. NOT GRAMS NANO GRAMS. She said she gave me the highest amount of classes due to suspicion. Now I cant work or anything, and I signed the contract like an idiot. They know i am upset and refuse to let me speak with the director. The entire shelter staff is in on this bull shit. I'm not going to go, they can't make money off me if I'm not there.
10klofn,,j5uovdb,It's stupid for these programs to admit you for using marijuana, a LEGAL substance. It is also used as medicine but shelters still would have a problem with people using it in their facility.
10klofn,,j5up6es,I understand that it would be against the rules to use it INSIDE the facility, but 21 year olds who do it ocasionally are even getting in trouble for it. And the way they are treating it is terrible. I'm so livid I cant even go into detail at the moment
10klofn,,j5upe4w,I understand. I've been there! It makes me upset as well.
10klofn,,j7mqzdh,Alcohol is legal and people are admitted all the time. Depends on circumstances. Just because its legal state its not federally. Probation officers can also tell you no substance use which includes drinking and pot. They can even tell you you can't go certain places. I couldn't go to the casinos for 18 months.
10klofn,,j7mrltb,I know..but still..
10klofn,,j5ugtda,For real fuck em
10klofn,j5ryp14,,Shelters are traps, I found that out the hard way. The reality is, as it turns out, we are not free nor do we have any right to liberty or happiness. The law is based on a culture of shame and everything works based off a hierarchy of power, where everyone gives and gets shit on. The bottom is where everyone is scrambling to get away from, no one can be trusted down here, this is the innermost circle of hell. I would forget about any notion of happiness immediately as it is a delusion that will only distract you, causing more failure. But when you do fail, use it as a learning opportunity lest you waste the time and energy. Time is the only real currency anymore.
10klofn,,j5sfaq3,When I was at my lowest point, I would go to the library and read zen meditation books or listen to podcasts online. The idea of sufferring and happiness both being temporary states was helpful. It gets better and worse, that is life.   There is no justice either so that becomes a reality that is inescapable when you are homeless. Acceptance is the only way to move forward and I still feel crippled in chains despite all of it myself.
10klofn,,j5vbmv2,That‚Äôs so depressing. I‚Äôm homeless now but I‚Äôm glad this isn‚Äôt my mindset.
10klofn,j5s11ej,,Thank you! Thank you! For making this post. I thought I was the only one. Everyone keeps telling me to go to the shelter. They  have no idea it's a different world out there. Now I understand why my ex-girlfriend was panicking and crying when she realized I was going to stay in one. That's when we were dating... Shelters are horrible; the good ones don't have Walk-ins and good luck finding a bed
10klofn,,j5sm5oh,I started telling people, if you don't live in a dorm don't suggest it to others. There's a reason why you don't. Love your neighbor as yourself instead of throwing crumbs to the dogs.
10klofn,,j5smf0p,Well said! Some people called me picky or proud for not wanting to go to a shelter but have no idea how tough things are there
10klofn,j5u36fj,,Women's shelters. I'm in a 1/2 decent one but even this one ..... Uggg. The house manager is a gossip & at least one of the residents is a snitch
10klofn,j5v0a7j,,My local soc service tried to put me in one. I said i'd rather freeze to death in my car in a safe area instead of risking my life and getting aggravated in a shelter. There's a reason why shelters are in high risk areas. They label everyone and put all homeless in shelters. I don't fit the typical local homeless stereotype. Soc service workers told me it's not true what i see and hear on tv. It's because the media says shelters are bad but it's not true, soc service said. If it's not true why does everyone hates shelters. It must be true. I've never been to a shelter, never been homeless but houseless since early teens. I'm not going to a shelter. I'll die if i have no other option but i won't set my foot into a dangerous prison.

10klofn,j5sgx95,,Dm me .  I got room in my van .  Together we can overcome .   Van life wouldnt be so bad if i had company.   By the way im no perve or anyone w nasty  Intentions.  Im a good guy just trying to save up  Here and there to get a place.
10klofn,,j5smi69,Good guy, huh? Interesting username.
10klofn,,j5smt8d,Yes we all make mistakes .  Maybe You are the only perfect human on earth.
10klofn,j5ud0rj,,Everything is temporary if you put some effort in it. No family will help you...why?  Post locally for help but without a job...income...and the desire to change your situation it will never change.
10klofn,,j5uf970,I'm not even going to waste my breath on you. It's quite obvious you have a bias against me already. Fix your own life before you shit on mine.
10klofn,,j5uoz90,Right. don't waste your time with people like this one. Judgmental from the start
10klofn,,j5upbqk,Right? "Why wont your family help you?"  And then automatically assuming that because I am in destress I am not teying to make things better
10klofn,,j5uqkfi,Sometimes, it's our own family that disowns us and causes us the most harm. Family is supposed to love us but that doesn't mean they do.   You are doing the best you can in your situation that you don't want to be in. It's unfortunate but it's part of life.
10klofn,,j5uqml0,Yes, unfortunately it is
10kcsaq,j5sdb52,,Op you need to get regular showers. Can you join a gym? Buy or make something like this. Fill with water and put in the sun. I would try to shower every 2-3 days. It‚Äôs essential for so many jobs.   https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-Camp-Shower-5-Gallon-Solar-Shower/339782766?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222228000000000&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=m&wl3=42423897272&wl4=pla-51320962143&wl5=9028819&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=339782766&veh=sem&gbraid=0AAAAADmfBIouxOH4waGEeuES7Lanp7L0v&gclid=CjwKCAiAoL6eBhA3EiwAXDom5n6QJGV4XwFHXadpHlzIKw-lAnzcoBtmUpdkseqccDhD6sK4Jt-PEhoC07kQAvD_BwE
10kcsaq,,j5vd2t0,I've been working for the past year so it's not in the way of my employment. I look fine - everyone is always shocked that I live in a tent. I just feel gross and need a better cleaning method.
10kcsaq,j5qdmbd,,It's hard to give definite advice without knowing what kind of irritation you're talking about exactly, but my first thought is that the wipes you're using could be the issue. Especially if they're alcohol based (but even if they're not), they will mess with the normal, healthy bacterial community on your skin and essentially select for more aggressive species and strains, which could develop into an infection of something like Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas. Wipes will also just make the seasonal dry skin of winter even worse, which causes irritation, too. Either (or both) of these can lead to an immune reaction like eczema or psoriasis.  Try switching to a different type of wipes and use them less. I find that the best way to stay clean without showering, at least in the winter, is to wear a base layer of good long johns and an undershirt and wash them as often as I need to. Go to a laundrymat that has a sink and handwash then put them in the drier.
10kcsaq,,j5qtct4,I just use baby wipes. And I have base layers I change frequently. Main issue seems to be that dead skin builds up and isn't getting washed off. I've been attempting to find a low-key way to fake showers at work that doesn't take longer than my 30m lunch break
10kcsaq,,j5qw4sj,I have had that problem and ended up being very sick. Everyone was looking at me like a bum
10kcsaq,j5r0mqa,,Takes time homie. Especially if you were the kind of person that showers twice a day. Don't under value a natural skin layer, remove it once it hits that "baked in dirt you can't wash of with just soap and water" level. Y'all know what I'm talking about. Keep clean just don't worry about scrubbing the skin off. Once you wash and dry your hair keep it covered as much as possible, that will cut out the dirt and wipe oil out of your hair until your scalp slows down oil production. Use a brush to stimulate your scalp and if you sweat dry it out completely. Salt and oil build up kills.
10kcsaq,,j5r9suv,I was always a shower once every few days person while housed, so it didn't hit me for like 4 months. But like the 3rd shower I managed to snag I realized there was so much built up dirt and I didn't feel like I could fully get clean. Now I notice it all the time and feel gross. I've been keeping my hair covered and up all the time, which helps. But I get so much dead skin build up after a while and IDK how to prevent it/how to deal with it with no shower.
10kcsaq,,j5rekoi,Ok bro I think I understand better now. Go to Walmart in the camp section grab a collapsible bucket and a 100% cotton bandana and a cup. You're going to get FAST at this trust me. So fill your bucket with water as hot as possible and go into a stall. Fill your cup with water and throw your bandana in it and crinkle it up scrub your whole body with the cup of water no soap just get wet. Dump the cup into the toilet grab more water in your cup and rinse your bandana off then dump it. Now soap and scrub all your skin with the cup. Now you need to get the soap off use the cup to keep your clean water clean and rinse yourself off with the bandana. The last step is the most important, wait for a minute and press and rub your skin with your fingers and palms. if it's to wet this won't work just give it a little longer. The damp skin will literally roll off you. I don't recommend doing this to often it can be ruff on fresh skin. Just as needed. And you can use the bucket to was normally in between.
10kao7a,j5pl6th,,We're well aware of him.  He's a nut job.  He got banned over here and started that sub out of spite.  He took a few people with him in the process.  Good riddens to all of em.
10kao7a,,j5qkqhw,Same guy dm'd me for a comment a made on a completely different sub and starts ranting a bunch of garbage. Didn't realize he was branching out.
10kao7a,,j5pm425,yeah he mentioned he was "bullied" off this subreddit and left, when i told him i was coming here after messaging about the ban..........he very quickly unbanned me :S. but can cleary see why he was banned and i have left that place.

10kao7a,,j64k1cq,Would be nice to know what we even disagreed on.
10kao7a,j5x2b3d,,I got banned in the r/Germany subreddit for just making a post about how Germany is having second thoughts in sending tanks to help Ukraine. Which is unthinkable. The banned me.

10k3dme,,j5o5ukz,I'm just back to the west coast so I don't know how it is there. What would you say it's like? Dm me if you want to talk privately.
10k3dme,,j5o64fn,You're near California, that's cool. Must be warm there, in general, it's cold here, but surprisingly hasn't snowed in Jersey yet. However new york is getting hit pretty bad though. Lol In general my homeless life is too bad. Have my SSDI and snap card.  Got a storage unit as well where I keep my stuff.  üòÅ
10k3dme,,j5o6cih,I was in Mass in November I was waiting for the cold but it never hit. I just want to give back but it works different depending on where you are from.
10k3dme,,j5oe7c8,That's cool, so you kind of travel around the states?
10k3dme,,j5oeh2c,Just briefly the Midwest is still a mystery to me. Honestly I'm mostly stuck in the north west of the country.
10k3dme,,j5p9ymw,Oh I see.  I would love one day to travel away from jersey, been to Florida once, I'm in New York a lot, but I haven't really been anywhere else aside from the Northeast part of the country.

10k3dme,j5rtiev,,Oregon. It's pretty nice to be homeless here compared to most other places. Lots of resources, weather is only bad bad maybe 2 weeks out of the year, kind people, and fairly lenient laws. Biggest issue is that because of everything I mentioned, there's a LOT of homeless people here. This means the housed people are much more callous towards homeless people, there's more desperate people on the streets who want what you've got, and longer waiting lists on services.
10k3dme,,j5ru9v6,What services would help more? I'm probably closer to Portland but I can tell volume is an issue.
10k3dme,,j5vfht7,One of Portland biggest issues is drug use. They keep trying to crack down on it, but they're doing a shit job. Arresting people doesn't make an opiate epidemic magically dissappear. We desperately need better mental health services, both addiction related and otherwise.   We would also benefit from education for police/local officials/other people with power as to what actually gets people off drugs (which is helping them fix their life and get stable before trying to get them sober, instead of forcing them to detox in a facility/prison before dumping them back on the streets you found them on).  As for non drug related things, winters here have been becoming increasingly severe in a way they have never been before. This means there aren't many existing resources the can help people when its starting to get cold. Not just shelters but assistance with supplies (hand warmers, dry socks, tarps, raincoats, close toed shoes). We also need more places that can provide a warm meal.
10k3dme,,j5rudsf,What services would be needed? I'm near Portland and was thinking of trying to research there.

10k3dme,,j5w76t7,Everything here is expensive and if you're homeless you're going to struggle. Do you have a specific question about resources?
10k3dme,,j5w7lth,Just what would help the area.
10k3dme,,j5w7zzi,Definitely access to affordable housing and better homeless shelters....For example, I'm chronically ill and can't find a home. You can be on a waitlist for 8 years
10k3dme,,j5w9bc3,That's going to be hard to solve for given how expensive everything is there, I'll give it some thought thanks for your input.

10jzz90,j5o6tw2,,Please use the report function to report any scam messages to the Reddit admins.
10jzz90,j5nr4nw,,Super common, 99.9% scams or people looking to take advantage of those in less fortunate positions.  Theres really nothing you can do to avoid it short of not being active on subs where this occurs. :/
10jzz90,j5obaye,,Honestly, yeah, this sub sucks with stuff like this.   I know I'm going to get downvoted for saying this. But a lot of people's posts are met with either creepy ass replies; or straight up harassment, (especially towards those who are mentally ill, disabled, or trying to receive assistance).   Part of the reason why I haven't made a post, even though I've wanted to for a long time. Seriously, I sometimes wonder how many people on here have actually experienced homelessness. Cause that stuff is the last thing you want to see.
10jzz90,j5nwu5v,,Mate I think it's pretty common. SOME people want to prey on the less fortunate. Always go with your gut feeling and stay safe.
10jzz90,j5q3h7s,,There has been quite a few scammers posting on the sub in the past few weeks, so I'm not surprised.  It usually happens around this time of year for some reason.  Last year it was Philly Foot Pics and her boyfriend.  She  this sub for over $4000.  Remember guys there is a reason for the policy here of sending money to people for a reason.
10jzz90,j5p0407,,very very common, lots of weirdos lurk here to pray upon the homeless

I pray about it all here and stuff offline I don't even know how to pray lol.  Please stay here though don't get down and leave.   Weird messages, can pple have multiple accounts? Maybe that's how. Im not sure. Maybe a bot sent those messages, can bots do that? AI is so smart I wonder if it's AI not human.. ? I play a bot elsewhere and goof off. It's good timing you posted this.   Hhow are you faring? Are you ok, have basics despite homelessness? I haven't seen any uncomfortable messages or messages I've gotten didn't bug me. I'm still jarred about the MT city letter about how one municipality is gauging how to operate or navigate the homelessness pop in their area. The unmoored post yesterday was at this sub.   Maybe sincere colleagues and peers but like the mods here warn don't get scammed, be safe online. Follow mod rules. Pple seek human connection so it's probably harmless. I mean pple are mostly good. Strange messages can be reported but it's probably nothing. One day a person said some ugly stuff about food and the bathroom. I thought ok, popping off is cool. I did not reply or really know what to say.   Something I'm going thru at a new sub, mental health island reddit is that I forget that some pple live by hierarchy and I don't in that pple are pple. I'm happy to be in life. I get in trouble by error in stepping on toes but that's my peer, so I'll reach out and talk it over. At times a few pple my age made me feel inferior and they did intimidate me but that's last year, last decade . With the resources here and YouTube I feel mentally stronger.   . I celebrate basics. Yesterday at the shelter I had these warm veggies and fresh shower items. Did laundry. The ladies started fighting so I left but ate ok. Slept in a dark calm place nearby stores.  Sorry back to the topic, Everyone matters as people. They are someone's son, daughter, pple equal or sameness with the human condition so I don't judge strange messages. At times I reply with resources I felt or sensed I must send them in return. Not intuition. Then the non equality types and I debate over words about words about words. It's nuts. I'm nuts. Their nuts. But that's elsewhere at reddit. I just get too into my debates because I've lost friends to cults and other stuff excluding death.   Everyone here is ok towards me. I'm a friend to pple, with nothin,g totally poor.   I confess I often lash out and get mean on certain topics other subs when I'm mad at life or in pain. So I say sorry often. At times I'm frustrated with no apartment and read elsewhere of the most absurd existing concerns I get existential and at times cold.   But I'm venting at the void and at my inner constitution. At times and it's not DMs, but I'll start swearing which isn't not ok for me. My blood pressure goes up over current events and emotional topics. I feel I'm unseen or not heard at all. Invisible. Disempowered. I try to practice telling my truth and this annoying maternal/paternal instinct kicjs in and I start giving advice. Lol. I don't have children didn't want them or pets - I wanted a life of few attachments my art my music. So selfish of me. I feel speak freely openly with reddit.i try to practice being heart based here. So when someone is lashing out at me I apply listening and empathy. There are pple at reddit that judge that life choice as someone to not listen to whuch is totally ok.   Back in 2000s, even 2013 I used to get pictures. Adults today don't even send a dick pucü§£üòÇü´£üôÑ. I found more dick pictures from jobs I've had but never here. Reddit is a very unique little hang out. I like how the features here work. Reddit is so supportive. There's 741741 text for help if needed that's cool. I find reddit can be a mirror or a place of peer led solution finding too. I missed several messages from the good pple and they took that as rejection. I am homeless and wifi isn't always accessable. So I hope those pple are ok. I meant no harm by not replying just didn't see it. Daily it's carrying my body, trying to secure basics , get to next morning and it's not easy. I'm debating going back to my car from the place I'm WiFi ing at because of OKC roads. Snow day. But I have to balance gas and heating for truck with donut tire so I can't go far then it's snowing. Lol. It will be ok.  Most of all you matter, stay close here, as you go towards housing, housing will work out. Support to you sorry I ramble.   Thank you reddit..
10jzz90,,j5s5pcm,Yeah I'm doing okay, been keeping clean and busy mainly riding my bike, I'm pretty hungry currently cause my paychecks only come in fortnightly but to be honest I've been in far worse mental states in the past. This situation requires me to think and move and be out in the beautiful Australian scenery.  I have a few friends in the area and they are all worried but I feel wrong relying on them. I know I'm strong enough to deal with it.  "when a man knows why he lives, he can withstand any how"
10jzz90,,j5uunx8,cycling is enjoyable I did that to and from work often in the past. good job on your upbeat atitiutde. thats uplifting.   hang in there. just ask for a few minor things. I know its tough to ask for help. it was tough to acept help at times because of the ever hanging over my or anyones head of "why canot you sort life out?" well housing is more complicated today, why? supply. look up travel hacks and head to anywhere you want and start over there but that means leaving freinds behind which is never easy. last month my freinds had to take me in after living in my car for 11/2022 into last lmonth until I recovered. medicaid in america said i cant have any more hospital stays until 2024. I said what happend to 2023? no reply. america is calling one place that says one thing then you are sent to the next number that gives more different data. confusion.   yes i like that quote, trust yourself first.
10jzz90,j5q162y,,Yes I got those a few days; one of them tried to use religion to trick me. Talk about trying to take advantage of people

If you start feeling warm and comfortable it means you're in the later stages of hypothermia get up and call the EMTs. Tomorrow if you can go go grab a space blanket they're like a dollar at Walmart wrap them over your tent under the tarp if you have it and then wrap them inside of your close.

10jtc8s,j5n3huj,,Or someone else suggested calling a mental hospital and getting committed for a short time. Your life is valuable and you will not be taking a spot from anyone. You need it the most.
10jtc8s,,j5o87hk,I always recommend this. Im a nurse in a psych hospital, and the vast majority of our adult patients are homeless people who claim to have suicidal ideation so they can get inside for a few days.   I am always shocked at the amount of hate I get when I recommend this. People spew nonense about how you lose your rights and they will keep you locked up. Thats all such BS. Going to a psych hosptial is one of the best options out there when you are homeless in America. Hopefully the hospital has a decent social worker who can help set the person up at a rehab or sober living after discharge so they dont go back to the street.
10jtc8s,,j5oow92,hi, yes!!! grattiude to you!! a few HOS stays just for food, water, a bed, rest. then i did get plurisy and other illnesses 11/2022 into 12/2022, admitted to the hospital for lung abcesses thats just staying in truck/car for a few months in the cooler air and some cold temps 20 to 35 degrees at night.   social workers and case mgmt is exhausted and they turned their backs on me. citing policy, i thought, move on, another social worker can be a light to me. thank you for being a hurse and caring for us. it makes me sad on in patient when others scream, yell and hit staff. i was hit by a pateint and staff couldnt do anything but place her into quiet time out.   still. still. I went to any HOS for the help, food, water, bed. its not ok to stay homeless and i didnt want or pick a life or a stint like this. staying warm is a huge, huge cost. i didnt get my meds like lithium or cant take the whole dose because i have to be hypervigliant of surroundings and not zone out or seem under any influence of anything. scary. i told the housing authroty its too difficult to live like this. in okc, im one of 20,000 people seeking housing.
10jtc8s,,j5r7egq,Thabk you for that! I am very sorry for your situation and i hope it gets better. If you let your social worker know you are looking for a sober living, or residential housing, the social worker should be able to hook you up to get off the streets.  Being homeless is a terrible life.l, my father was homeless from the time he was 30 till he died in his 50s. It really broke him. I wish I could have helped him, but it wasnt possible. I see him in every homeless mentally ill person i care for.
10jtc8s,,j5pdzfk,forced drugging sure sucks tho
10jtc8s,,j5r6za2,They shouldnt be doing "forced drugging." The only time they can give unconsented for meds is if you are an active physical danger to yourself or others, or if you are under court ordered treatment. And active physical danger means thibgs like banging your head on the wall or punching people. If they are forcing drugs on you outside of these boudaries complain to your state health department or CMS and they will be in a huge world of trouble.
10jtc8s,,j5tnnvg,last time I got acted, I got my turn with the psych and was just like "Yo I think I'm Bipolar 2" and he's like "yeah that sounds aight" and gave me some pills I don't even remember. I took them once and woke up with the spins, scared the shit out of me and my ex. Amazingly, I've rediagnosed myself as not actually bipolar.  Next time, I'm just gonna ask for speed and blow.
10jtc8s,,j5s2nqb,You're assuming 100% homeless are on drugs or are alcoholics. How horrible of you. How completely horrible. I loved your reply til that last sentence
10jtc8s,,j5s7w4m,I am not assuming that at all. You might not be familiar with sober living housing. It's not for substance abusers. Its just housing that is drug free. You dont have to have a history of drug abuse to be in a sober living house, you just have to commit to not doing drugs.
10jtc8s,,j5vg0f3,Ohhhhh okay! Yeah, I definitely wasn't familiar with that. Thanks for explaining :)
10jtc8s,,j5vuh0d,I actually wasn't aware of that either until I was assisting in getting patients placement. There are way fewer resources for mentally ill who do not have a substance abuse problem. The social workers told me to give the patient a sober living list and i told them she wasnt a substance abuser so she couldnt go to a sober living. They explained to me sober living isnt treament focused, its just about agreeing to live drug free while in the home to support a wellness enviroment.   They are wonderful resources for anyone who is homeless. They usually have a couple of people stay in each bedroom, but it makes the rent super affordable. And most of them will let people pay by the week so you dont need a huge chunk of money to get in. In Arizona the cost was usually about $60-$75 a week.
10jtc8s,,j623l6i,We need these places all over the usa in every city, town, village, etc. Shame all these empty houses from coast to coast can't be used for this. All ppl need is a safe warm place to lie their heads, low low rent so they can actually save $to move onward.  But that's too easy for the govt. The way things are going, it nearly seems the govt (usa at least) WANTS the majority to be homeless.
10jtc8s,,j70hpzj,Go put your foil hat on
10jtc8s,j5mspqq,,Thanks for showing your face, fellow human, I see you. I‚Äôm sending powerful intentions into the universe for you, that you feel safe, that you stay healthy and get some rest.

10jtc8s,,j5onr59,yes!! what bright beautiful eyes of hope!
10jtc8s,j5my4ob,,Find heated shelter please. You will get frostbite and lose limbs or die. Sit in a planet fitness all night or a store 24 drinking coffee. Call the police and get arrested to sit in jail for 24 hours. Whatever you need to do, do not stay in that cold.
10jtc8s,,j5n5r3u,This OP, one cover will not keep you alive at those temps, go take care of yourself some how and keep going
10jtc8s,,j5oo5y9,yes, what about the ER for a while? they are kind will give you a tray of food and try to keep you for a while. please do not die out there. homelessness is survivable. we can all, we can ALL OVERCOME THIS. and look back and think, "oh how minor, oh go existential, what a camping trip from hell." omg i wish everyone here had housing.
10jtc8s,j5mjeyh,,Damn,Bro.Hope you got a lot of covers.
10jtc8s,,j5mk6tk,just one cover
10jtc8s,,j5msu0l,how did u become homless and is there no way u could go to a shelter or a relatives apartment

10jtc8s,j5nozm9,,You can not fall asleep in the open, considering the temperature and your lack of gear! Find something to crawl in, stuff it with leaves or paper, any type of shelter or you're in serious danger.

10jtc8s,j5n0jam,,Has anyone ever tried calling the police to get to sit in a jail cell for 24 hours to prevent sitting in the cold all night? Just anything to stay alive.
10jtc8s,j5mng13,,Hang in there. Rubbing your hands together can give you some warmth from the friction of your palms. Good luck dude

10jtc8s,j5qgwi8,,Find a Salvation Army or Catholic Charities and they‚Äôll direct you to a shelter. Dial 211 also to get crisis resources. Unless you‚Äôre not in the US which is where these resources pertain too.
10jtc8s,j5n7vbu,,Damn homie
10jtc8s,j5nf996,,Ball up like a hedgehog.
10jtc8s,j5op87p,,remember to move your feet, toes and body even if you are laying down. it sounds strange but movement during the cold helps alot. but i cant imagine facing 5 degrees the worst was 20 degrees forme. love, support, sustenance and warmth to you. i tried overflow shelters in OKC, no room. nothing. then again i caught plurisy and other illnesses there so its chose to be warm in a shelter and put up with fights or stay outside. staying outside is safer but colder.
10jtc8s,j5mxhg3,,Man I‚Äôm sorry hope you can stay warm enough through the night. Try to drink some OJ or something so you don‚Äôt get a cold like I did from sleeping in my car
10jtc8s,j5nhasy,,One of this dudes friends please reach out and locate an emergency shelter.
10jtc8s,,j5nmfxp,i dont have friends

10jtc8s,,j5sj0kh,cant you get in with a friend or something? i feel so bad for you , i dont know the shelter system in your country but you look as if you need better warmer place to stay , how about churches?
10jtc8s,,j5skdze,i try to atay in warmer places when i can but not always have possibility
10jtc8s,,j5uqjpu,you have no family that can help you?
10jtc8s,,j5ur05o,my parets died like 7 years ago left me nothing i managed somehow to this year never asked somone for help till now.
10jtc8s,j5qoxs0,,Look up thread, someone offered you a sub zero sleeping bag!
10jtc8s,j61qu68,,This is very unusual. Municipalities in Poland always have temporary housing available for situations like this.
10jtc8s,j5pwl02,,Its 24 degrees f for everyone who was confused as me
10jtc8s,j5mskb0,,Imagine on your breath inward you are fueling a flame in the center of your chest, with every breath it grows warmer and brighter.
10jtc8s,,j5nn8q7,Dude, stop spewing this mystic bull, you're going to get someone hurt or killed. Sick to say this to someone in such a desperately dangerous situation.
10jtc8s,,j5no9jr,Some of it works but it‚Äôs psychological rather than mystical. Just it has limits and -4 is past them. It also doesn‚Äôt remove the effects from pushing your body past it‚Äôs limits using it.   I‚Äôm familiar with it and utilize mind over matter well past the point I should. The mind can overcome many things but death comes for all who freeze or are dropped into molten lava. There are limits. This is most definitely not the situation to be pushing it. At best it could help perform a mental exercise while preparing to die.
10jtc8s,,j5mwipi,Wow. It does nothing.
10jtc8s,,j5mwmnn,It wont if youre skeptical. Mind over matter friend. Sorry youre going thru this
10jtc8s,,j5rhmip,You should totally go outside when it‚Äôs freezing and try it. Report back!!
10jtc8s,,j5nc04n,Power of the mind in this case? You sound like a hippie who fried their brain on too many 5 lsd strips. EDIT: Plus breating under your blanket will just cause the condensation build up and further worsen the problem.
10jtc8s,,j5ncop5,Right. And thats unfortunate for you to misconceive that. In any case yeah you can control your metabolic processes and bodily functions with your mind through visualization, for good or bad.  Every had a full bladder and not been able to pee?  Every tried to shoot a basketball and you kept missing until you stopped trying?  If you tell yourself that you are warm you will be. Just like if you tell yourself you‚Äôre cold you will be
10jtc8s,,j5nffam,Yeah if there would be like 15c outhere maybe. But  if you have only 1 blanket at -4 it's kinda an emergency and you can imagine how you are not cold all you want up to the point till you freeze to death.
10jtc8s,,j5nnxq6,This is just imagining until dead in -4 with one cover. Even then it only becomes effective when you get so cold you get numb. That‚Äôs bad btw. The numbness I mean.   It doesn‚Äôt work in extreme temperatures quite the way you seem to imply it should. It won‚Äôt stop op dying and rn I‚Äôm really afraid that‚Äôs the way op is gonna go. He may even already be gone, considering the last responses in the comments where roughly five hours ago.   Op is in an emergency situation and death is quite likely. They need immediate help not to die.
10jtc8s,j5onp98,,im osrry this is happening to you. OKC is awaiting snow. please stay warm and stay nearby a place like 24 hour gas stations or 24 hour grocery store? im hoping youstay warm.
10jtc8s,,j5onyrk,i will try
10jtc8s,j5q036r,,If you can, get your hands on one of those foil emergency blankets. They're crinkly-sounding, but you'll be toasty as all hell in one of those in the single digits

If you‚Äôre up in the east coast I don‚Äôt mind giving you some blankets. I also got s couple warm jackets and socks. Got an extra heating pad too if you have the means to use it anywhere. Gets a bit wonky and needs to have the cord adjusted to stay on but it heats up fast and stays warm. It‚Äôs yours if you want it my friend

10jknbk,,j5pigfi,Bro you listen to too much Abraham Hicks. You probably troll the spiritual subreddits for fun. Thus making you even dumber while you waste precious time on nonsense.   Your comment makes no damn sense and you know it.
10jknbk,j5niam6,,If all you want out of life is yoga and meditation, why not just find a retreat center to work at? A lot of them take live in volunteers, at least seasonally. Vipassana centers are a great place to check out too.... The courses have long waiting list for new students but they provide 10 days of lodging and food and literally all you do is meditate. Once you're an old student (aka have taken one course), you can volunteer for courses and all centers have live in, year round staff who are experienced meditators.
10jknbk,,j5o6da6,Honestly, this is a really good idea. I had a teacher who did something similar, and they really enjoyed it. OP, I would highly recommend you consider this option.
10jknbk,,j5qkqjt,Please link some legitimate programs that dont cost $500+. Preferably a fraction of that.
10jknbk,,j5qsjx6,What is it you would hope to get out of a meditation retreat? What do you hope to accomplish with your yoga? I've always followed a spiritual path myself and it seems to me that that kind of life is incompatible with the way you're understanding "choice" in this discussion. Everything you do is a choice. It has to be. Live intentionally and all that shit. Until you can see how your current life is in fact something that you chose, meditation or yoga isn't going to get you anywhere.
10jknbk,,j5qwfrf,There's a lot more to meaning and language, and the meaning of the word choice particularly than this all encompassing idea you put forth which, nothing encompasses everything. So right there is a disconnect from reality   Choice is something relative to the lack of choice. You really cannot tell me that you choose to slip and fall, you choose to be hit by a car at a stop light, or you choose to have crippling depression. If you believe this, you either have not been through it or you forgot about it.  The above question is a good one noone ever asks. You are quite literally the first.   I have alignment problems through my whole body. Always have. I also work to hone my ability to focus through daily meditation, and then I do the physical yoga to work on my posture. In-between i do breathwork, and study. The goals are obvious to me but I don't have the names on hand for these states, there should be Buddhist terms out there.   There's the alignment of all 33 notches of the spine, I don't know if they're supposed to be evenly spaced but regardless they shouldn't press or stress each other at all. There's a natural curve I believe, but that's not what you feel for. It's about the weight distribution, lifting your body with your back. Having your center of gravity in the SP. I am a very skinny guy with development issues so I have to rework my entire body through this process.  Again I can't think of a good word for it I often point to the Vetruvian Man diagram that Da Vinci did because it shows quite well what I'm referring to. It's an important goal in anyone's yoga regardless of what they want to do, to achieve this alignment.   I also do bhakti yoga which is pretty personal if you ask me and it of course feeds back into the rest of my practices.  After this stage I can actually tutor others to do their own yoga.   I also still produce music and have that as a potential income. I had a laptop as recently as last September, and was making beats every day at the cafe and even sometimes just on the street.  But of course I got robbed. It's just hard to replace it right now  I know a lot of people do yoga to achieve everlasting bliss but, funny you speak of choices, I for one can say that I have the freedom to choose between bliss and reality and I choose reality. Nirvana is a virtue and at that a skill to tap into it but it isn't all encompassing. It's just the realization of what isn't all encompassing, leaving only what is.   Before enlightenment chop wood after chop wood and so on  I'm pretty sure everyone is just highly confused as to how life works outside of their personal societies. These notions just don't seem to be understood past the imagination.
10jknbk,,j61vsx3,International Vipassana Academy. All courses are completely free.
10jknbk,,j61w7sa,https://www.dhamma.org/en/schedules/schgiri
10jknbk,,j6206f0,Thats perfect. Granted, I need a passport, and probably a 'Real I.D.' to reenter the US whenever that happens.  I am honestly looking for something more long term, but this is a good start. And would hopefully result in some connections
10jknbk,,j636phr,These courses happen all over the world. When i took mine, at the end of the course, one of the managers said that they were looking for year round, live-in help. They usually want a seasoned student (aka someone who has taken multiple 10 day, and even 20 day courses) for those types of positions. But they're live in with food included as well as a stipend. There is a Vipassana sub if you would like to learn more. Best of luck with your search for healing and shelter.
10jknbk,,j66jj3s,I will do more research. The website you linked was showing me courses in India at a particular center.   Thanks for your help
10jknbk,j5nslag,,Have you looked into dialectical behavioural therapy?
10jknbk,,j5pdzyk,I went through fifteen years of treatment. They were not going to put me through DBT again. But you'd know that I went through all the treatment I could if you read the Post.
10jknbk,j5mjmca,,Maybe I'm missing something, but it sounds to me like you were living a comfortable life, with a job and everything and quit it to do yoga? ü§î
10jknbk,,j5mkyit,Yeah. And the confusion you are expressing is exactly one of the many things I am pointing at in this post. Maybe you are missing something. What is there to be confused about?  If you just can't understand then don't bother I guess
10jknbk,,j5mlh9c,So your current predicament IS your fault...  I think you should humble yourself and stop pointing fingers, unless you plan on pointing it at yourself.  You posted a long rambling incoherent post on reddit, im sorry I couldn't understand what you were trying to communicate, but there's no need to be a cunt.
10jknbk,,j5mlo0g,I didn't point fingers at anyone as far as blaming them for my situation. I'm not gonna miss this bullshit  Literally how can you just not read a post and then start fucking typing as if you know exactly what's going on
10jknbk,,j5mm81m,"Homelessness is a choice for many, but not for me"   Absolutely a choice you made.
10jknbk,,j5mnzqv,It was a choice made for me. My choice was to do yoga full time
10jknbk,,j5muzj0,I‚Äôm getting the message here that you shut off your flow of income in favor of yoga and are now saying that the whole issue was out of your control. If I‚Äôm right about that, how could you have possibly thought that bills were going to get paid? There has to have been at least some thought about ‚Äúhow will I pay for housing?‚Äù Before you quit.
10jknbk,,j5mwufz,No man. No that's not what I'm saying. If it was an option for me to be housed right now I would be housed. I only brought up money in the OP to point out the connection between funding and housing.  I am so utterly sick of people and this bullshit. Please go somewhere else. I can't fucking take it.   And no it didn't just shut off. I also make music and tutor and make small amounts of money doing it. I switched over in 2020 and wasn't homeless until 2022. But who gives a shit. You find a way to focus on the worst in things. It clearly gives the majority of people pleasure. And yet most of them just lie about it to themselves or everyone else.  Why should I even make my case to anyone this world is a dumpster fire. I do not have the wherewithal to exist constructively in it. And I certainly wouldn't want to be a mental vegetable under the care of anyone here
10jknbk,,j5n0c0v,Your not housed because you made the choice to quit everything to do yoga, is that what you have said so far? And since you quit everything you have no funds. That choice you made to do nothing but yoga whenever you want was a choice of yoga over housing and income.  what are you trying to say that it was a mistake to quit everything?
10jknbk,,j5n1xjv,Oh my god but it's not anybody's fuckin fantasy bro. I didn't wake up and say I'd love to be homeless. I didn't get given two options for doing what I needed to do, where my heart wanted to go. But I never brought that up, because nobody gives a shit, because most of you assholes don't follow your heart and don't know what that means.   No man I woke up one day and found out there was no place for me. Not even at hostels. Simply because I don't fit in and I'm not in the income bracket  Literally just go elsewhere how do you all keep making the same fucking argument and ignoring the response.  Each one of you has a different username but are you all the same person holy Jesus literally go back to being real life NPCs if that's your fancy  Edit: also screw all of you. It might as well be trolling. It's almost impossible to think that any of you could be really serious at this point.
10jknbk,,j5mzhf3,But, what exactly is your case?
10jknbk,,j5mzmew,Yo the post is fucking ten paragraphs long how do you have NO CLUE AT ALL I am done ‚úåÔ∏è
10jknbk,,j5mt163,So you're going to be a full-time yoga student (although you don't have an instructor) and you expect other people to provide shelter and food?
10jknbk,,j5oey6b,I get what you‚Äôre trying to say.  That the situation in which you cannot follow your heart without being abandoned by your species is ever present for most beings.  That it shouldn‚Äôt be that way, and it absolutely doesn‚Äôt have to be.  You‚Äôre expressing frustration at the way the world ‚Äúworks‚Äù while it only does so for a very particular type of person, and everyone else is fucked.  You wanted to just be happy doing what you love, and the absurdly wealthy just continue to win.  I guess fuck you for bringing up your frustrations though????  I don‚Äôt understand Reddit.
10jknbk,,j5pd1cz,It's not reddit it's just averages. You're looking at the majority response.   See the upvotes? Those are the ones like you and me. We are mostly silent.   I seriously doubt this is gonna get any brighter.  Thanks for your good heart still.
10jknbk,j5prjk4,,Kinda sounds like a choice you made
10jknbk,,j5q0wdp,Read all the other comments and their threads I have addressed this many times over ALSO RE READ THE POST
10jknbk,,j5q17ji,I read it all and couldn‚Äôt figure out what was outside of your own decision making
10jknbk,,j5qlcp4,When you make a decision to go hiking, and then you fall into a ditch, I hope someone comes around and looks at you. And says   'Well this kinda looks like a decision you made.'   While maybe your foot or your neck is broken   'Wish i could help buddy but you brought this on yourself'  Lol fuck you!! üôå
10jknbk,,j5qm5p5,That‚Äôs a stupid and invalid comparison. Maybe if I went hiking and intentionally jumped headfirst into a ditch and broke my neck that would be comparable, but I avoid doing that kind of thing when I hike. You didn‚Äôt accidentally quit your job and lease though did you?
10jknbk,,j5qmy8l,I didn't quit my job dude I started doing yoga full time during covid, alongside making music. My job never came back around.  Nor did I quit my lease you fucking asshole. I lived in a dorm year before last with these two brothers who made it super difficult to live around them because they wanted me to move out. Eventually I struggled so hard with it I went to a hostel because it was the next cheapest option. I didn't know about SROs at the time, and I havent had more than 900 dollars on me at a time since. Ive made many attempts at moving in to places either with cash or with assistance, the assistance never pulls through lately and often times I'm just competing with people who have more money than I do for rooms and accomodations. I get singled out by drug addicts so I stay the fuck away from the shelters.  What do you not get  Oh you dont get any of it because you have never been homeless clearly. Fuck you
10jknbk,,j5qo5ir,Yeah sounds like a series of choices you made

10jknbk,,j5uwp0h,Bro I love how the subreddit is for people to vent and connect and yet, y'all just go around violating rule 7 with every comment you leave. No wonder I haven't had this post deleted for cussing everyone out. I mean all around this is so not the point  And yeah I have the same normal levels of narcissism that almost all artists have. As a writer and a vocalist and an entertainer, and a tutor.  I listen to myself the same way I listen to others   I think the reason you point it out has more to do with your own insecurities
10jknbk,j5uxtxg,,The majority of you have just not been through this kind of homelessness. The majority of you viewing this post have not been through homelessness at all.  When you do go through it though, I hope you come back and find this post. Remember where/what the karma is.   Because I used to think like all of you until I got here.
10jknbk,,j5v4tdf,I'll just say it once.  My wife has a similar issue and isn't in treatment, we went homeless due to her actions & I had to pull us out of the situation.  You said that BPD isn't a serious issue - it is.  You never said in the OP that you went through DBT, and then attacked me and seem to diminish the importance of it.  You don't have your shit together, you're spinning out.
10jknbk,,j5v563x,I said I went through treatment, and yeah I do because DBT was some of the weakest and most ineffective treatment I ever went through. Meditation has done far more for me in terms of my ability to manage emotions and attachment.   And in reality you can't tell me DBT is not just social rehabilitation. Thanks, I'll create my own identity. Not that I didn't go through 4+ months of the treatment before earning my way out of a residential facility with changed behavior.  Yeah I do hundred percent think BPD is a joke. It arose somewhere in like the 80s as a diagnoses for people who can't receive a diagnoses. By definition it's not a disorder it's just the borderline of a disorder. Now it has all these symptoms which correlate and those really come from retroactively pointing out symptoms amongst those who are diagnosed.   BPD really came into existence to lump together people who really are not in the same boat anyways. There are plenty of BPD symptoms I didn't have, and never did. And plenty that slowed or stopped completely when I got out of classical treatment and into yoga practice.   ‚úåÔ∏è  I'm wondering if you even know that
10jknbk,,j5v5qy5,DBT is the form of therapy with the highest rate of success for BPD, but it requires that you take it seriously and acknowledge the issue.  If you don't get help and take it seriously, you're fucked.  That's all I have to say, and I say it from the place of someone who cares and had to pull someone else plus themselves out of hell.
10ji897,j5kn5k3,,Wow
10ji897,j5lwlud,,Scary times and no right to privacy
10ji897,,j5m1zae,I think I fucked myself when I signed up for an obama phone without reading the terms and conditions or privacy policy. They are tracking devices, hopefully that can be used to help the homeless population instead of harm them. It's likely the latter but I'm trying to be less cynical.
10ji897,,j5ml5fm,That isn't really relevant. All phones are tracking devices. Until there is a strict privacy law banning biometric tracking there isn't much to do.
10ji897,,j5ns0vi,It is relevant. Despite all phones being tracking devices, the carrier you use and its level of affiliation/cooperation with the gov or whatever shell corporations that are used to sell data to the feds is important. As is the model of phone. The apps you use, the people you talk to the sites you visit, all that data is being monitored by default on most if not all devices. It's the backdoors into those phones that are pre existing that are important. It allows companies, agencies or even individuals the rights to your data. By ignoring it I have ignored the possibilities of consequence for that ignorance. As mentioned in another comment the carrier I have used puts their phones out stock with malware on them. I discovered at least one identifiable and confirmed malware. There were so many system apps that were cloned or different versions of the same thing.
10ji897,,j5masli,Well, you aren't wrong.  I'm a bit conspiratorial but part of me says that it would be easy to round up certain parts of the population that way.  I feel the same way identifying as homosexual to any government entities.  There were us govt institutions that participated on lobotomizing decades ago if other treatments for homosexuality didn't work.  There's also the case of how the nazis treated homosexuals.  We are undesirables...homeless and homosexuals and our name starts with the same three letters.
10ji897,,j5nqv7n,I was talking about how I view that corralling type mindset the powers that be use. The rounding up of certain people. Homeless. Homosexual. Drug users. People with mental health disorders. But they also control the division of those people. Its a little long winded but the tl;dr Is, the gov uses tactics to create division. Basically causing division by coaching us to point out each others differences rather than our similarities.   This is a copy/paste from that comment:  The best way I can describe it is... There is the music genre "Rock". That puts its fans, which is a lot of people, in an aligned state of opinion about that genre. The media machine creates sub genres. Say, punk rock and heavy metal. They then control the narrative so that fans of those sub genres have opposing opinions of one another. Now there is a bitter rivalry between what could be an aligned or at least neutral group. Then they take punk rock and say there is old school or underground anarchist punk versus modern mainstream pop versions of punk. It splinters even more. I'm sure by now you get my point. Except with actual sensitive topics like politics, race politics, etcetera. Creating a divide on what was becoming an alligned force. Like BLM, which they completely derailed and then turned the narrative into a splintering effect that triples other examples. Not to go on a rant there, my mind is all over the place tonight.
10ji897,,j5mj2m0,What I've noticed with the Assurance Wireless phone was that it came preinstalled with uninstallable apps and malware. It will automatically open up a web page every 30 minutes or so, and change the redirect to a new site every few months. Resetting the phone doesn't remove it, either. After a Whois lookup on one of the sites I noticed it was registered to a Chinese company; although, ever since then they've been using private domain registration.
10ji897,,j5nra9d,I have also used assurance and can confirm it is *loaded* with malware deliberately. I checked my apps and selected the option to show system apps and there was at least one app that was identified as malware. But probably like 20-30 really sketchy apps. Cloned apps and multiple versions of the same one appear a lot. Between the preinstalled malware, the google terms and conditions/privacy policy, the carriers terms and conditions/privacy policy and the surveillance state that we are in... It seems almost impossible to bypass it.
10ji897,j5r69p7,,It's insane. I know it's safe to assume everyone is under surveillance but this is a new low. Not every homeless is a criminal and needs to be tracked. The more i see what goes on the more  i want to be off grid. I hope some day i'll be able to detox from the internet and unplug.
10ji897,,j5snkm3,The best way to start is to start right away. If you feel like being online is toxic then make the choice to take care of yourself. I know addiction isnt that simple, but I unplugged for 2 years. It made me cynical and look at the world differently, in both good and bad ways.   Honestly I havent thought about doing that in a while. Might be healthy for me to try it again, even if just for a day. Reddit is one of my only social outlets and I don't know if that's healthy or not.
10ji897,,j5tl9bz,It's not addiction. More like dependence. I'm dependent on it for information and communication. I don't do anything fun online or in real life. My existence is very limited.
10ji32w,j5kjgaw,,You lie about your current address. Change it later if you want.
10ji32w,j5kir3u,,Most employers just want a legal valid ID. And that the name matches the one on your social security card.     You tell them you just moved here and will update your ID later, most states have the rule you need to update your ID within a month but seriously almost no one cares. Employers want to know if you are legal to work in the US.    Many agencies that help the homeless will allow you to use their address as a mail drop, find one in your area and use it.    Good luck.
10ji32w,j5kohag,,Many non profits will let you have a mail drop at their business.   https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/get-help/help-with-something-else/mailing-addresses-homeless/  Post office Po box. Or their free mail program where they will hold mail addressed w their address & your name for 30 days for pick up   https://www.uspsmails.com/how-to-receive-mail-without-an-address/   Most homeless shelters allow you to use them as a mailing address.   You technically don't need to provide a permanent address for work - you can tell them you're in transition & will update HR as soon as possible.
10ji32w,j5kqv4s,,You can find a mailbox location that will give you a street address, not a P. O. Box number for a fairly low cost. Most places aren‚Äôt going to look any deeper to see if it is a real residence.

10jfpmz,j5kiet9,,You have a couple of options depending on how long you think this will all take.  If you have any friends, autistic or otherwise, THIS is the time to reach out to them. Couchsurfing can help you bridge the gap. Worst they can do is say no. As someone with asd, I have let other people with asd crash with me before.  You could look for a cheap weekly airbnb deal... or if you live somewhere with fair weather, you could buy a large comfortable tent and rent a campsite in a campground for a couple of months with that money. They have restrooms, showers, laundry, etc.  Homeless shelters for women and children are rather decent. You usually either get your own room, or share a room with a couple other ppl, and it's relatively safe.  Homeless shelters for men are pretty awful. You can often expect to share a single room with 50 or more people. Most of them are pretty dangerous and your things go missing. You get no privacy whatsoever, and most of them make you come and go during specific hours. between those hours you're either locked in or locked out.

10j4nu7,j5inmd4,,Homelessness is different for everyone.  Most people will say that homelessness with a car or a van is a much less miserable experience than street homeless.  There are miserable people everywhere.  A lot of people working 40+ hours a week and spending half of it on rent are miserable.
10j4nu7,,j5ji3kv,I work 60+ hours and I‚Äôm still homeless! üá∫üá∏
10j4nu7,,j5k3wq9,yeah, but are you **miserable**... since that was the point.  The person you were responding to pointed out how being homeless in a car is less **miserable** than being on the streets... and how a homed person with a job can also be **miserable**.  This was in response to the OPs post about homelessness and being **miserable**.  You seemed to lose the point.  Ok.  Great.  You've got a job, and you are homeless.  The OP **already covered** being homeless and having a job at the same time.  Do you have anything to contribute, in regards to whether or not you are miserable, since that is the topic of conversation here?  I mean... I work **7 days a week**, from **7:30am to midnight**... I've done this since September 6th, 2021 and the only day off I've had was back in June 2022, when I went into the hospital for dehydration.  I'm still homeless too.  Oh, and my job, requires me to appear to be in a relatively good mood, since it involves making Life Checks, ensuring the old man I take care of is still alive.  Am I **miserable**?  Sure.  Not because I'm homeless though.
10j4nu7,,j5k7hsq,To be clear, I‚Äôm homeless, overworked and miserable and nearly freezing to death most nights trying to get myself and my family somewhere to live. If you want to talk about misery, I can do that. I just don‚Äôt see the point. If I didn‚Äôt have a family to support, I could easily be homeless and happy. But I have to see the abject misery on my wife‚Äôs face because she got rejected, just like me, to the last 20 jobs she applied to, while struggling to do the same for myself. I already have work, but it still not enough with how much I work. At least I know my kids are ok where they are, but would you like to to detail to you the fucking misery of being so fucking broke that you cannot financially support your own children and spouse while working to the point to exhaustion every fucking day while only having to look forward to the fact that I made money to run the car a few hours to not freeze to death when the temps get to 15 degrees in the night? The fuck is your point? Am I not miserable enough for you? Did I not frame my misery with enough light for you? Do you wanna play the pity game? I‚Äôm miserable to the point of that suicide seems great fucking regularly, it has begun to be a serious problem for me. Miserable enough for you?  Jesus fucking Christ what what‚Äôs you fucking point even? Go sit and be warm and be fucking happy that you are not actively contributing to the suffering of those you love because you live in a society that would rather do away with the poor and the homeless and be stuck with the horrifying fact that even if you work yourself to death that they still won‚Äôt be ok.
10j4nu7,,j5kixgh,>To be clear  Actually... ***to be clear***... none of that information was present to provide any context to your comment about how many hours you worked while being homeless.  And there are other comments in this post from people who are homeless and NOT miserable.  So... ***to be clear***... there is no way I am responsible for knowing the details of your life, ***before*** you include them to provide context for your comments.  The fuck is my point?  The question was...  >but are you **miserable**  ... and a Yes or No would have sufficed.  The comment I replied to, could have been taken either way... miserable or not miserable... since you would not have been alone or unique if you were not miserable working 60+ hours and being homeless.  At the time of your comment, you could have hypothetically been living in a nice conversion van, remotely connecting into an office via the internet, posting different amazing vista shots on Instagram of the views you wake up to.  I had no way of knowing.    I just knew you didn't contribute anything on the actual topic of the discussion.... aka whether you were homeless and miserable or not.  You only contributed how many hours you work, and the fact that you are homeless.  Nothing more.
10j4nu7,j5jbagc,,Homelessness is something different for everyone but you got to avoid the pitfalls. I made it a point when I was homeless living in my van to stay away from the toxic ones such as the drug addicts, the fast talking scammer types, drinkers, and just anyone who got trapped in the the cycle of negativity.   The only time I found peace was when I was locked in my van with the tunes going, in my bed.   For me the key to keeping it from getting miserable was progressing I went from losing my job getting divorced and the ex-wife getting everything to living in a van started off doing janitorial jobs, deliveries, got myself a security guard license then an armed guard license. I made my way to becoming a cop and then a deputy sheriff.   I retired on a disability pension after a bad car accident and heart attack on duty.   The key is to keep moving Do not stagnate progress.
10j4nu7,j5ldii6,,You can forget about the beach. Cops will chase you off. But as for being homeless in general, that depends on your location. If it's a big city, it's Philly gonna be hard. Rural area are the way to go. Especially the southern us.. southern folk are much more generous. City folk will look right through you. I am homeless by choice, basically um doing what you're contemplating.. Technically I'm a vagabond, since I travel around alot. Fact is you're still gonna have to work in a way. You need money to eat, and to get money you'll have to do cash jobs, bussing, or panhandle. I prefer panhandling.
10j4nu7,j5mqqxy,,What you are describing is not homelessness. You are craving more of a vagabond/drifter lifestyle. I personally applaud you and feel that your the perfect age to try this for a year or two. Work odd jobs, maybe live in employee housing, make enough to feed yourself, meet interesting  people.
10j4nu7,j5injis,,This homeless shit is easy if you have a good head on your shoulders and aren't addicted to drugs or alcohol. I been doing it 3 months and haven't went hungry once. Shit or even been unhappy one day. Although I live more of the hitchhiking traveler life, not like i had any savings nor do I work. Just get my ebt every month. The generosity of people has been greatly shown to me as well.
10j4nu7,,j5iuc63,What part of the country have you been traveling in? Where would you recommend to start. I‚Äôm currently in Alaska and after my next paycheck will have about $1000 to buy a ticket anywhere.
10j4nu7,,j5iumm4,I've been all thru california, Oregon, Nevada (sucks), Arizona, Utah, Colorado, New mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, now Florida. California has lots and lots of resources. I would recommend taking this time to travel on a dime whether by train or hitchhiking. Get a decent pack and sleeping gear and there's always somewhere to shower and charge your devices. You don't wanna become a home bum.
10j4nu7,,j5jhn3b,"Nevada (sucks)"  Agreed. For a lot of reasons. For example, have you ever tried to sleep when it is over 100 degrees at 3am?
10j4nu7,,j5k47ha,yes
10j4nu7,,j5iuor8,Socal not los angeles is cool san Diego ain't bad either

10j4nu7,,j5kokox,Who's somebody?
10j4nu7,,j5kp14v,Idk, maybe I was surprised it didn't block you from using it by state, but maybe I'm not surprised. XP
10j4nu7,j5rw00z,,It depends massively on what resources, skills, and connections you have. I'm very good with people, motivated and in good physical health, able to work while homeless, in a city with moderate weather and good public transit, and in a relationship with another person who is also all of the above. I feel like I'm doing fine.   Homelessness can mean eating found leftovers before sleeping in a 3 month old t-shirt for 20m on a freezing park bench before getting arrested for loitering. Or it can be hosting Thanksgiving dinner for your camp, and waking with the sun to go to work. Or it can be 1000 things in between. You never really know exactly how it will be for you until it's happening
10j4nu7,j5j1h7g,,VERY, especially in FL. Tropical in FL means wet heat, hotter than you would ever believe, heat that is impossibly hard on the body. Mosquitos as big as your hand and LOTS of them as well as huge roaches, fleas an atom bomb probably wouldn't kill. Also they are very down on the homeless and there is almost no support via social services. I can't speak for the other states but FL is a total hell hole.
10j4nu7,j5iozsu,,It really depends on the person... what they are used to, what their needs are, how well they adapt. I pretty much grew up homeless. I don't even know what the other side looks like. My expectations and comfort threshold are much lower as a result.  I can't speak for California or Hawaii. People complain about Florida LEO, but no one ever bothered me. Sleeping on the beach sucks though. So does sleeping at night in the summer if it gets too hot, but that isn't too often unless you are in the Miami area. That few degrees really makes a difference for me.  Some of the delivery services allow you to deliver by bicycle in some markets. The money is bad, but it pays for food and you can work whenever you want. I would rather have a real job, but unfortunately I'm fairly useless.  Things may be a lot more comfortable if you get a car, and especially if you can swing getting a Prius that: 1) is large enough for you to lay down in & 2) the climate control can operate without the vehicle running constantly.  To me, either of these options *seem* a hell of a lot better than having to work two jobs to afford an apartment that I only use to sleep and shower, but I guess I don't really know.
10j4nu7,,j5iuh5p,This is very helpful, thank you. Where in Florida have you been homeless / where would you reccomend?
10j4nu7,,j5iwqv3,Go to ENGLEWOOD BEACH  FLORIDA.  You will be homeless in paradise.  Free showers on the beach .  No crime at all .  Most gorgeous beach ever  And people are so nice.  Its like a senior town .  Plenty of food everywhere  Can fish and cook.it.  Its a Paradise on earth.   TONS OF JOBS IF WANTED TO WORK.  Zero crime . Super laid back .  Its hidden gem . Look it up om Youtube.
10j4nu7,,j5jjr0z,I think anything I said would be based on personal preference rather than anything objective. I've been all over Florida except the keys and the Naples/Ft. Meyers area. No place seemed particularly good or bad, except that I would avoid sleeping outside in any area near extended stay hotels or tourist attractions.
10j4nu7,j5jdpi1,,It's a different experience, compared to sleeping in a bed.  Obviously, you don't have a mattress or privacy. But when you do get it figured out, it kind of feels like camping.
10j4nu7,j5jyz4z,,It's not miserable, just try and sleep in a secluded area and stay away from people and police.
10j4nu7,j5ifkvl,,Don't worry my guy the new word order is coming soon and millionaires will be on the street taking survival lessons from OG homeless
10j4nu7,j5iluhg,,It can be very hard, some manage better than others. My experiences were very difficult. Bathing and daily living tasks were hard to accomplish and staying cool or warm was a constant challenge. Winter 2009 was cold and I had struggled with hypothermia.
10j4nu7,j5k1zx4,,I was recently homeless and it could have been a lot worse had I been outside. AZ native, so ending up homeless during the summer was hell. Over 100 all day and night. I was at the shelter downtown in tent city, in the dorm for people who work. I got a bed and food at the church. If there was 50 people in that dorm I was the only one trying to get out. Very caveman in there. I now have a 2b apt and 2 chihuahuas. My day would be work, stoned, sleep. Nothing good to engage with around that place.
10j4nu7,j5llgol,,I think you‚Äôre already asking yourself the right question about if you‚Äôre just romanticizing it. If I were you I‚Äôd maybe not scrap the whole idea but like look into hostel at least or‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm blanking on the name but found this through Reddit (wrong time or the year for where I‚Äôm at now and I‚Äôm disabled so didn‚Äôt think this was likely to work for me) but there are farms and such that will take volunteers and they‚Äôll house you as long as you work and a website I‚Äôve seen that will link you to ones around the country. I‚Äôd make some sort of plan like that over just straight up going homeless.   Because the one thing that I try to emphasize to folks and wish someone could‚Äôve spelled out to me (didn‚Äôt really have a choice but this is definitely what took me by surprise hard) is that one of the worst things about homelessness is how hard it can be to get back out of. Like once you‚Äôre already unhoused life seems to have a way of throwing even more shit at you and kind of keeping you down. And so many of those bad things that would suck but be relatively easy to deal with while housed are a lot harder to deal with once homeless- talking thinks like an illness or injury, being robbed, having your car break down, etc. even far smaller things just seem to have a way of piling up. I think I foolishly believed that being disabled would give me some kind of leg up. But nope. If anything it‚Äôs made it a lot harder.   Obviously I‚Äôm in a very different situation than you but broadly speaking it seems a lot of us never intended or expected our homelessness to continue as long as it has. It‚Äôs also stupid lonely sometimes. And dehumanizing. I suppose doing it by choice has the advantage of meaning less emotional baggage than what a lot of end up carrying (as in, a whole lot went wrong in my life all at once that landed me in this position. Coping with that shit and trying to address those issues definitely makes things s lot harder). But still, I‚Äôd say have a plan of some kind as much as possible.
10j4nu7,j5lm6ru,,It‚Äôs the worst‚Ä¶.being distressed every time; possible harassment by especially cops. Potentially freezing to death

10j37e3,j5iauht,,A comfortable place to sit. The staff at the shelter I was in had those hard metal folding chairs in their offices. It would have made me feel better if I'd had a soft place to sit. Can you have a mini fridge with water and juice? If you have any pets, maybe add photos of them. Everyone likes animals (well, most everyone).
10j37e3,j5iv01l,,Just be real with people and recognize they are human veings with as much variation as any other person.  Don't say I'm sorry, or you're so strong or bullshit like that. I like the colouring book idea. Not sure how the clowns and dolls would go. Would definitely be a conversation piece.  Also remember to protect yourself. Don't give away too much personal info re your likes and interests. Anybody who dislikes you will be able to start to put pieces together to turn it around on you. Remember people are people. And desperate circumstances bring out the best and the worst in humans.   Some of the most frustrating and angering parts of being homeless is the loss of autonomy over your own life and the words with no actions. The way stigma informs services and funding, as you have already seen. Often in really naive and useless ways that only make the trap worse.  Ask people what they need, what they would like. That would have blown my mind. Especially when it comes to simple things like handouts of lotion and socks or whatever. I cried one time because I got some apples and it was just by chance they were in a box that was given to me. I had been really craving one, but had no choices over the food that I ate.  What I started calling "acts of dignity" were super rare, but they were the ones that really stuck in my brain. Indicated that person as one to watch to see if they actually cared, would advocate for me, and someone who may be worthy of trust or respect.
10j37e3,j5iqfgu,,I was stuck in a homeless shelter last summer and I was really upset and sad. Pictures of animals always make me feel just a little better.
10j37e3,j5j93hp,,Fruit bowl would be fab if you can have a stock to give out. I used to grab fruit from the reduced section to share out when I was working in hostels/hubs since you won't find much coming through food banks/donations.   City map can be useful if you're talking housing, easy to point to an area and you can put pins in for relevant services for easy reference.   Photos/art etc can be nice to look at. I err toward well known characters/films/places etc, as opposed to clearly personal stuff, when I'm likely to have a lot of people coming through. You can tell someone about your own pets or interests if it feels safe and appropriate down the line, but you can't walk back from someone recognising your dog that they've seen out in your garden or feeling like you won't relate to them because all your photos are from your graduation and expensive holidays.
10j37e3,j5l6n2a,,Fidget toys may help too! It may help some people feel more comfortable
10j37e3,,j5lei1g,Totally was going to comment the same. I keep a few in my bag and have had a couple of kind folks gift me them as well and every time I‚Äôve walked in to a crisis center or office of any sort where there‚Äôs fidgets out on the table I always feel a little bit safer as a neurodivergent person.

10j0gvv,,j5lvm9k,I agree that public info is not doxxing, but I am not a good barometer for what "follows" the "rules".  For instance, my username would have been much more explicit were it not for site and subreddit rules.

10j0gvv,,j5jiv0h,Being homeless is a choice dontcha know.  That all you gotta do is hike up them bootstraps and POOF you now own a home and have two kids a wife and a lovely million dollar job!  Just like everybody else!
10j0gvv,,j5jo56p,TIL.  I‚Äôve been doing it all wrong.

10j0gvv,j5ixnjx,,"These wanderers are well networked" -  I've done van life, rainbow family, grateful dead tour, and street life, and I can confirm that organizing "wanderers" is as easy as herding cats. This jackass is so out of touch and full of hate that it's disgusting.
10j0gvv,,j5llpy4,This reminds me when nurses at a hospital I was sheltering at insisted I should have pawned off my phone because I was homeless.
10j0gvv,,j5m23qq,I don't see why you didn't. You'd have $40 tops for a day, and there's no way, being homeless, you'd ever have to call emergency services. You'd never be around someone od'ing, seriously injured in a fight, or having serious  medical problems due to lack of access to their proper medication. üôÑüòë
10j0gvv,j5im8tk,,I love that they describe this shady "network" as "progressive," clearly there's no political bias driving their decision to write this!  My attitude is that if a homeless person wants to use my money for drugs or booze, it's none of my business. Who doesn't want a little relief or something to take their minds off the madness of the world?  Besides which, don't most homeless populations in the US consist mostly of locals and not "networked" homeless people traveling to random towns/cities because they have a homeless shelter?
10j0gvv,,j5jtjzx,Some homeless people do travel all over. I'm thinking that the shelters do get overcrowded and so they feel that they have a better chance getting help somewhere else.  Until they realize that this is a nationwide problem.   I'm not proud of America the way it is right now. If I have the power to move out, i would.
10j0gvv,,j5nkh19,It is a nationwide problem which is why it requires a nationwide response.  I would propose a Affiliation of Cities that would tackle the problem (housing being the utmost).   Let's say a hundred U.S. cities joined and pooled resources to address homelessness so that any one city would not be overburdened and each could bring their own unique solutions based on the type of homeless people, climate, job availability, drug rehab, mental health accessibility, and of course housing.  For example, Seattle and Portland are inundated with many homeless with drug issues because of the cities'  libertarian approach to drug possession.  Funding from the alliance can help finance more drug centers and safe places for them to gather, rather than the streets and makeshift campgrounds.  In turn, funding for economic distressed homeless in other areas of the country get help from the same alliance budget, but addresses that specific problem.  Mental health services, job programs, affordable housing, etc  all can be financed through this program.  Currently, every city and region is left to its own devices and so solutions are piecemeal and inadequate.  It will take a combined effort to effectively tackle homelessness.  A nationwide effort.
10j0gvv,,j5phygk,Great, rational answer. There is no one solution, but many different factors to consider.
10j0gvv,,j5l9heq,The whole nasty letter got to me but then I had sort of a bitter laugh when they made damn sure to squeeze the ever popular ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give homeless folks money. Most of ‚Äòem spend it on drugs and alcohol‚Äù line in what was already such a cringeworthy and out of touch screed. Like you knew damn well that line was coming or if not directly spoken was clearly something they believed.   As someone who‚Äôs also queer and Jewish I am wondering where all the secret networking and cabals I‚Äôm supposedly part of are meeting and why I‚Äôm not getting the invites. Must be the lack of address and all them drugs I‚Äôm doing.
10j0gvv,j5hx0vv,,damn. I'm speechless. I guess none of them are familiar with Jesus. I bet they pretend to be.
10j0gvv,,j5rahsd,They absolutely are familiar! You are speaking of the Republican Jesus, right?
10j0gvv,j5iaaij,,I like how they solicit their community's opinions on "their experiences with the homeless" but they have zero interest in talking with actual homeless people themselves, who are apparently _not_ also members of said society.  Fr though reading this was like listening to fingernails on chalkboard.
10j0gvv,,j5jt065,Yes! I really hate that.
10j0gvv,,j5kbmhh,I want to go there now.

10j0gvv,j5jsey5,,Thank you OP and everyone who provided info and links about this. I have personally worked very hard in my own community trying to dispel dangerous myths like the ones put forth in this letter. The willful ignorance of these commissioners makes my blood boil.
10j0gvv,j5jhctp,,Here is the actual published letter, that they thought was a good idea to publish and would make them look better.   https://flatheadbeacon.com/2023/01/21/selling-out-montana/                               Thanks /u/MrsDirtbag I didn't want to shit where I eat so to speak and drop something here I shouldn't.

10j0gvv,j5jjumj,,The War on the Homeless rages on.....  so stupid.    DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS YOU CREATE, society and leaders of the "free world".    Greed of the few over the need of the many is not the way to build a healthy civilization.
10j0gvv,j5jmux5,,So does mine Although they do have a few places where you can enjoy a lump of oatmeal & a cup of coffee [ 1 teaspoon of sugar] for you to start your day. Well ,it's off to the library for a few hours. Cold & rainy here
10j0gvv,,j5jnfvm,If I can't get gas today  I'm gonna just slap a mailbox on this car.
10j0gvv,,j5jovc3,Sounds familiar.   Shelter boots us out into 20f weather and the library doesn‚Äôt open for 4 hours.   Gotta stand there like an idiot while the whole city drives by yelling insults and looking down on us.    They don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre 4 pay checks away from standing right here with us.
10j0gvv,,j5kdgor,Agree.  I used to volunteer at a shelter and that is exactly what would happen.  I was and I am sorry.  I didn't know what to do.  I hope they went to Macdonalds to stay warm but even that was a far walk.  Even people who want to help others don't know what to do.
10j0gvv,,j5jp1y7,Same here
10j0gvv,j5k59ni,,‚ÄúRugged individualism‚Äù. üòë
10j0gvv,,j5n9q5s,Most accurate statement I've ever heard, and I'm the very definition of a Rebel lol!
10j0gvv,j5i1l1p,,This isn't going to change until people get active and organized, and start opposing this with direct action. It's going to take protests, civil disobedience, mutual aid, and doing things to undermine the reputations and pocketbooks of the people making these decisions, as well as the people and businesses supporting them. Until we build this kind of solidarity, this trend will continue. We have to build it now. There is no more time to wait. People are dying because those who might be inclined to care are sitting on their butts.
10j0gvv,,j5jilos,They don't seem like they're just sitting on their butts, it seems as though they're trying to act and organize AGAINST "The Homeless THREAT".  Locally we keep hiring more police and community patrols and crap to tear down homeless tents and camps and to keep them shuffling along.... instead of trying to actually help.  hard conversations my ass.  The only difficult conversations these people have is done in the bathroom on their golden thrones.
10j0gvv,,j5ka84q,I thought I was pretty clear, but I guess I should have been more explicit. When I said ‚Äúpeople‚Äù, I meant people like you ‚Äî not people in the government or the people who obviously support them. Now, obviously, one person can't really do very much unless they have an exceptional amount of time, talent, and resources. But it's pretty unusual, even in deep red areas, for everyone to be in support of this sort of crap. Those people need to organize. There are so many other issues that run along the same vein that are just as serious, like systemic racism, LGBTQ+ rights, and police abuse that there's no excuse for people not to be organizing. Again, one person can't really do it on behalf of others ‚Äî you can't make other people do what they're unwilling to do. But everyone who has some awareness of this stuff has a responsibility to stand against it, to the degree that they have the means to do so. And almost everyone has some means. I have had perhaps the least means of anyone, and I have still tried my damnedest.
10j0gvv,,j5kc23x,So what should I do?  I'm in another state.  I'm not a voter there.  Do I just write a letter to them?  Would they care?  I don't disagree with you I'm just in need of a specific call to action.
10j0gvv,,j5ke7m7,I'm just sick of fighting when it's obvious the ones leading are corrupt and have too many financial conflicts of interest to be open to any change.  It's SUPER liberal where I am, and everyone here would much rather believe in the broken system and outlaw protests entirely than listen to any radical views like helping the outcasts.  Many more people are being abandoned daily by the system, just discarded by society.  Instead of increasing our ability to care for our vulnerable our taxes are put into expanding and encouraging our euthanasia program.    Rather than listening to dissent, those in charge are censoring it and filling the remaining space with propaganda.    We're led by criminal psychopaths, it's the only explanation.  I don't think anything will work, honestly.  No one is organized here, anyone who tries to do anything good is shunned by society and is putting themselves at risk for things like having their bank accounts frozen.  Still, protest, and disobedience seems the only real option.  Mass strikes.  I'd personally like to see everything just stop, most of the work done is just evil and helps take advantage of even more people anyhow.  I just don't think you'll ever get enough people on board until most are starving in the streets, and by then it may be too late.
10j0gvv,,j5piqdt,You‚Äôre right, but first you need to have viable suggestions in contrast to this letter that will work. It isn‚Äôt going to accomplish anything to just oppose something when you don‚Äôt have any suggestions to fix the problem. And it cannot be to just ‚Äúgive everyone houses‚Äù or some other unrealistic and ignorant suggestion.
10j0gvv,,j5pqbbr,There are plenty of viable suggestions out there. And the housing first policy is one of them ‚Äî choosing to dismiss it when it has worked elsewhere doesn't make it not viable. Even leaving things as they are is better than what this letter is proposing, since these kinds of policies make things worse, not better.
10j0gvv,,j5ptwjv,Not saying housing first isn‚Äôt viable, just that most people have no specifics on how it‚Äôll work, who will pay for it, how utilities will be paid for, stipulations, requirements, who gets a house and who needs residential care/treatment, employment assistance, what the plan is for long term, etc. They just say ‚Äúgive everyone a house‚Äù and roll their eyes like it‚Äôs so obvious. That turns people off.
10j0gvv,j5if6j8,,Just signs of the time we live in today. It will get to the point where being homeless will become illegal. Already, many States are cracking down on homeless and semi- homeless folks.  The depression of the 1930s had millions of people homeless with no jobs. Now we have increasing numbers of homeless because inflation is out of control.  This is only the beginning of a serious catastrophe. We have stupid leaders in Washington and across the board. These people either don't have  clue to what to do or simply just don't care.  Becoming homeless can be brought about by many factors. A hurricane or tornado can wipe  family out of everything they owned. A fatal disease can destroy  a families savings and life work.  These so-called leaders just label all the homeless as boozers and drug abusers. Meanwhile. they continue to waste billions of dollars on wasteful spending.  It is beyond reason as to why this country can send millions to other countries but can't spend money on its own citizens to solve these problems.  This crazy inflation is going to put many more into the streets. The American dream is gone!
10j0gvv,,j5jny4e,Yep. Less than half of my homebum homies are users.    And even many of those are just doing it because of their situations.  They‚Äôll blow $20 a day on it. Not enough to reintegrate so they escape reality for an hour.  I don‚Äôt begrudge them that.   We‚Äôre all on the same team.
10j0gvv,,j5jsqtb,billions for the Ukraine, zero for Americans
10j0gvv,,j5k2wf5,Situation was the same before Ukraine dude. Don't use right wing talking points.
10j0gvv,j5jrquu,,I was homeless while pregnant with my first daughter, living out of my car. I had lost my job and soon everything else bc of Covid. I wasn‚Äôt on drugs or an alcoholic. This is absolutely gross. Ewww no ma‚Äôam ü§Æ
10j0gvv,,j5lcoii,I‚Äôm sure the actual majority of us are more like you and me than this wild imagined view of homelessness they speak of in this letter.   (in my case severely disabled with needs too complex for most nursing homes to take me even if I wanted that, had an abusive relationship end as I was already battling a really shitty housing situation. It‚Äôs been such a traumatic and awful mess. I tried begging for hospice but had the doc refuse- perhaps rightfully since there‚Äôs no reason I should have to die if I just had the right supports- yet oops not finding any such supports)  I actually quit a heavy cigarette habit during the height of Covid and after becoming homeless quit using medical marijuana so not only was I never a drug addict, if anything I‚Äôve done the damn reverse. I obviously can‚Äôt speak to your situation being pregnant but it sure seems like those of us with multiple complicating factors- so the being disabled or pregnant while homeless, are even less likely to get help or folks don‚Äôt know how to help but are all the more adamant something must exist. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to help but there must be something!‚Äù Seeing a lot of that. I began to realize social workers and case managers tell themselves this stuff so they can sleep at night. Whether we survive or not is beside the point in the end.   Glad you said was so I‚Äôm assuming you made it out? Were you helped or did you ultimately end up white knuckling it through alone?
10j0gvv,,j5lehpg,I worked random jobs to get paid and saved. Got approved for low income housing and just worked my way back up. It was hard no doubt but there was no way I was bring my baby into the world homeless

10j0gvv,,j5p3suw,Good job... What we could do is start a go fund me for the shelter in honor of the commissioners!  Then send a letter to them so they know their letter has sparked interest and support for the homeless and their shelter.  Or I could just send a donation to the shelter and send them a letter which would have a smaller effect, but it would be easier.
10j0gvv,j5jjjyn,,WOW.... that's all I can say on this. Just WOW!!
10j0gvv,,j5jojj0,So sayeth we all.  Unreal.  Pissed off that homeless people show up at shelters.    The nerve.
10j0gvv,j5jyp9q,,I like how they act as if these people CHOOSE to be homeless like yes let me quit my job, stop paying rent and go live out in the streets with no money, no food and no shelter! ü§™
10j0gvv,,j5lap5q,Reminds me of the same people (I suppose because it IS the same people) who are so certain that folks are faking their way onto disability because oh absolutely who would wanna work when you can get a $900/month check from the government. It‚Äôs wild to me this attitude of ‚Äúwhy should we ever help anyone. It‚Äôs just encouraging people to stop trying‚Äù. Like do these people hear themselves? And that most also are quite religious as well, or claiming to be. The hypocrisy is astonishing. Like lord knows it‚Äôs nothing new but it never stops boggling my mind anyway.
10j0gvv,,j5nb08z,People are very narrow-minded these days and get easily jealous because of their own feeling of missing out on some things, so they have little patience to hear other people out. It's sad, but it's a sign of the times, lack of empathy is what I'm trying to say.
10j0gvv,,j5najx6,Some people unfortunately are faced with either paying extortionate rent in an unhygienic slum, or live in a semi-comfortable existence in the privacy and security of the middle of the forest. It's a real dilemma I had to face. It's definitely doable, but you need survival skills. I saved money as well and eventually got into a much better position in life.
10j0gvv,j5k6rn7,,"Enable them" to what, survive?
10j0gvv,j5igbsj,,One of the MANY reasons I left montana and that area back in 2010. The entire MT government is corrupt. The police and justice system there is so corrupt that They WILL arrest you if your neighbors hear you curse in your own home and charge you with Disorderly Conduct. This is in direct violation of your first amendment rights. They'll also allow the cops to steal your car and have it illegally towed.
10j0gvv,j5j59ck,,so basically they won't do it unless other communities do it
10j0gvv,j5jt6v6,,Are they saying all homeless there are drug addicts and alcoholics? They label all homeless.
10j0gvv,,j5y7ccr,All? No: how ridiculous and black-and-white.   A significant minority or slight majority at least? Definitely,

10j0gvv,j5ne156,,You know, they can solve most of this problem by bringing back things like $500 rents, $100k houses, and stable jobs.  But nah. They just wanna be expensive real estate cunts, play keep away with the good wages, and then bitch and moan about the consequences.  These fuckers made their bed. The homeless are here to stay until the cost of living goes down.
10j0gvv,,j5nnz6i,Their plan is to slowly strangle the population till it's down to their ideal size, and they incite social problems to do this. Drugs, poverty, starvation, etc, it's all enabled by Design.
10j0gvv,,j5nrgk3,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a smart plan. People in power need other people, preferably a permanent underclass, to do all the things they do not want to do. Rather than wittle down the population, my theory is that people in power want as many people in prison/indentured servitude as possible. Remember, when they ‚Äúoutlawed‚Äù slavery, they left a loophole : it‚Äôs legal if it‚Äôs as punishment for a ‚Äúcrime‚Äù. It is no accident that so many things have become a ‚Äúcrime‚Äù ever since that happened. The people in power basically want slavery back, so they‚Äôre making everything a crime and trying to incarcerate as many people as possible. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôre going to get their ‚Äúpermanent underclass‚Äù of people to do all the things they don‚Äôt want to do for the cheap.
10j0gvv,j5j742v,,...Montana. What do you expect?  Also - Flathead county - makes it sound like they have no brains, kind of fitting.

10j0gvv,j5k3zq9,,It's probably a pro landlord state versus support or offer assistance to the unmoored.  Nice term, like it.   Ask the city the letter is from/by if there are weekly housing meetings about the homeless plight.   I am begging for housing locally. It's just a wait. That's ok. Things take time.  üíî Been trying since March 2022 after my landlord was writing tenant default letters based on cameras at the complex. They tracked and changed rules on myself and others.   Two pple plus myself are hud, we were weeded out.  üí∞Was never late on rent.  Landlord mistreated me said my apartment was dirty. It was not. My art area was disorganized. I was as not allowed a pottery wheel. They said it sounds like a drill. Untrue.   üí∞Donated to their bus grift that doesn't run at all.   üíêü™¥üß§üß∫üß¶Cleaned their dirty laundry room. Got in trouble for "upstaging" staff. I didn't upstage anyone I cleaned their messs because cleaning my environment matters to me. It doesn't bother me to wipe whatever up. Just clean it.   During fall 2021 staff could not decide on when to mask. After getting mistreated at the 10/30 Halloween chili cook off I got sick, the tenant default letters started 11/1, dad died the 11th. They wrote me another tenant default letter 12/1, I landed up in hospital over cardiac chemicals. Potassium. I masked the entire 11-12 months I was there. They thought it was shady. No. I'm at risk for illness and I mask. Basic.   ü™ÑüßΩAll I did was wipe down after a round of Lysol spray. The washer contained dirty baby diapers after landlord moved her teen daughter with a baby into the unit landlord forced a OU student out of. His sin was similar to mine, studying or drawing outside. üìùüìöüé®  It breaks my heart but the Christian Taliban Control Patrol runs shit. I thought I was some kind of believer, after meeting them and hearing their beliefs I shuddered from the authoritarian talk. Void of agape.   Housing vouchers don't matter, case mgmt doesn't care and expect to lose 70% of your stuff when no one worked on a 105 day 7/14&15/2022. Evicted that day, mocked and fucked with the whole day.  So glad I don't live there.  Landlord started fixing renters hair, placed the smokers on nicotine patches to stop them from going outside. Because going outside upset two women that babysit baby while mother and grandma landlord party. Going outside set off a loud bell and set off cameras. Their camera notifications are on their phone. Their jobs are hellish, everytime a person goes outside past certain areas the cameras alert staff. Their job was to watch cameras and record comings and goings often then play them back with a different time stamp.   And they get HUD contracts, grift money, misuse funds, waste paper, it was a office of control freaks.  By March I learned the city wants to bus out the homeless or place them at two centers for food and a bed. Two mental health wards. Been to both.   If you are found as a homeless person you are sent to a mental health court of no recourse. It's not capacity related or need related. The purpose is to cycle, cleanse the shelters, filter pple around into receptacles that I thought were hospitals of help.  So the letter is of no surprise to me.   Cities need to communicate with landlords to stop false fake evictions but if the property owner to wants you out, you are driven out.   At the moment or last and this month I've driven/flown around the country trying landlords. No matter where I tried the old landlord won't let me rent. Case mgmt and orga gave me apartment leads and paid application fees, old landlord said don't rent to me. Negative rental refs as the housing voucher expired.   I'm still seeking housing. My case is minor existing details I'll overcome homelessness.   If the letter posted is enforced I seriously doubt the police will try to harm homeless people. Police here try to help and a few attend weekly city housing meetings.
10j0gvv,j5k4okj,,After reading that....I'm just shocked....I guess some want to be homeless I just never met someone that wants to be and stay homeless. I'm so üíîüíîüíîat this letter.   My dude or dudette I'm sorry this tone of letter was printed and signed. Are there any cases of violent homeless people to warrant the letter?   However cities will do anything to uphold their city image and funding. I hear city council meetings live online at YouTube. And it's nice pple I've met them at art walks.

10j0gvv,j5kyck0,,"Many times, that spare change you give to a homeless individual will be spent on drugs or alcohol"  Even if that's true, what the fuck did you think *I* was gonna spend it on?
10j0gvv,j5l183i,,r/montana
10j0gvv,j5lmakh,,You should start littering there
10j0gvv,,j5n9e5a,Very obvious g/stalking tactic unfortunately. Pickup a coffee cup and you've neutralised the threat lol.
10j0gvv,,j5nblvs,Oh more to be a menace than enact any real change. Very annoying to the one picking up the cup. Also what is g/ stalking?
10j0gvv,,j5ndtrj,It wouldn't make any difference to me, honestly, I would be proud to keep my environment tidy. If people are are purposely trying to create a problem by dropping rubbish then it really annoys them.
10j0gvv,j5n9utf,,The person writing that should just take some paid stress-leave and forget about the obsession. Or have they used their stress-leave already?.....
10j0gvv,j5ruyvf,,Okay, let's just pretend there's a bunch of homeless people who aren't truly in need of help. Why would they be seeking help then? You think they're taking shitty free food and clothes and everything else when they have access to better things?   And even if there were a bunch of people just taking advantage of the help, why would you take resources from those who ARE struggling in order to stop them from doing so? Those priorities are as out of order as they can be.   Also, how do they know that the resources made more homeless people come there? I'd imagine that when there are fewer resources fewer of the homeless population is documented.   Do they understand how hard it is to pick up and move? That's immensely difficult for housed people much less unhoused people. Who you know on the street is often what keeps you safe. No one is like "hey I heard it's easier to get on food stamps 3 states over, let's spend money we barely have to leave every small bit of stability we've built here, so we can get a shot at that!".
10j0gvv,j5u2pxw,,County does not equal city‚Ä¶ lots of conservative counties out their trying to preempt city ordinances. Not sure if thats the case here but its good to be precise when assigning blame
10j0gvv,j5y74u1,,Most of this is factual. Mental health treatment services are necessary to treat the prevalence of schizophrenia among homeless demographics, and probably criminal justice enforcement to stop car prowlers and other predatory "lifestyle choices" as outlined. Giving money and providing services without demanding rehabilitation does absolutely nothing to keep the problem from perpetuating, and it does the opposite.
10j0gvv,j7zu8il,,Fuck this letter. If someone wanna buy beer with the money I give them that‚Äôs their choice. I‚Äôd like to see the author of this letter live life in the street and see if they don‚Äôt want a drink

10iyv7l,j5howrg,,Hopefully it will last you a bit. Are you able to get food for free anyplace? I know it hurts to sell stuff when you are in a bind.

10iyv7l,,j5lbkf8,Typos can be malicious, luckily this one wasn't too bad.
10iyv7l,j5jd84m,,Aww, but if a resource can help you, sell it. Over the years the attachments mean less and survival or basic needs food, gas, shelter matter.  Hearts to the pokemon collection. ü´Çü§ù  I had all three hardback dark souls guides, hundreds of pages and someone else burned them because I'd want them or sell them. Few more things I traded/sold to get by. There's a cleansing impact to letting go but yeah it's tough.   In the past of lack then great wealth parents would sell all sorts of stuff. But that's life. Hopefully you won't have to make that trade off again. Maybe If u miss them look them up online. When I had to reduce assets or stuff I took a picture of a few things and accepted that it's a resource to help me survive, sell it.   Support to you. It's not easy a choice.
10iyv7l,j5muu5l,,that's very good you don't drink or smoke - don't accept that crap from anyone ... fentynal would be a worry -  I guess trying to find a job that can house you somewhere would be nice - u can give them a great bargain and work for minimum wage or below for cash maybe?

10ipz2d,,j5n0w8b,No problem. It's usually general labor type jobs, but the pay is usually 90-130 per job and you get paid direct deposit the next day.  Great for the homeless or even when you get housed and have a full time job, you can always pick up a weekend shift if you need some emergency money.

10ilegi,j5gd56v,,Tent won't support the weight of the snow. The way you are supposed to do it is build a giant snow pile and let it set and firm up for a few days I think. Then carefully hollow out the inside.   But no way is a tent supporting any amount of snow required to hide it.
10ilegi,,j5ibn6a,I certainly wouldn't assume that a tent could support the weight of snow. My thought was building a snow pile that was big enough to pitch the tent inside, but was built to support itself. Of course, that doesn't mean it couldn't collapse and things couldn't go wrong. But there's lots of potential for things to go wrong no matter what I do. That's just kind of the situation. Basically, I'm trying to find the least bad option.
10ilegi,,j5idf4u,Well here are more detailed instructions on how to make a shelter out of a snow pile. It says let it "sinter" for only 90 minutes in the instructions, I don't know if I'd trust that, I'd want at least a day to let it set personally. I don't think I'd try to make a snow pile big enough to fit a tent, that'd be huge. Just make one big enough to shelter in.    https://scoutlife.org/outdoors/outdoorarticles/2992/how-to-build-a-quinzee-snow-shelter/
10ilegi,,j5kikcz,if you used igloo construction methods, there's no reason why it wouldn't work (ie tent in a tent), but you need pretty deep snow to cut blocks out of
10ilegi,j5fpk4h,,Not a good idea.  You're still going to get swept.  The city has starting enforcing the camping law and they are cracking down everywhere.  The Artic Blast drove everyone indoors and the police are taking full advantage of that.  They are not going to let anyone set up camp anywhere for the remaining of the Winter.  And it doesn't help that it has snowed 5-6 times since the Blast. The snow isn't going away. You'll be waiting forever.  It snows here until May    Start calling around to the shelters now while you still have time.  They are all full because of the weather and the recent migrant surge, but you should get ahead of that to reserve a spot.  Good luck out there.
10ilegi,,j5fq7bd,I have had no luck getting into shelters. I've already tried and tried and tried. I also have disabilities that would make it very difficult for me to function in a shelter without a serious problem, and one thing that's become clear from talking to others is that shelters here have zero regard for the ADA.  That said, I would think the snow sticking around longer would be a good thing for this kind of idea, rather than a bad thing. IF a shelter could be built that wasn't apparent, that nobody knew was there because it just looked like another snow pile, then having the snow stick around for months would draw out how long that would last.
10ilegi,,j5fu4wa,I called the St Francis day shelter.  They have a few beds open at various shelters.  You have to be dry.  No alcohol.   Call 303 297 1577.  One of those shelters are Samaritan House.  That's the best shelter here.  They will accommodate your disability with no problem.  They even allow service pets.  There are also a ton 24/7 warming centers open which I am sure you are aware of.
10ilegi,,j5fug4u,I have an animal that's NOT a service animal. That's one of my reasons that I can't get into a shelter. Also, I'm autistic, and accommodating the sensory overload issues I have is likely to require housing me in a quiet place separate from everyone else. The overcrowding and noise can cause sensory overload, which can lead to shut down and meltdown, which can be a dangerous situation for everyone.
10ilegi,,j5lnz00,You‚Äôre not picky. I have health issues too and shelters would make me very vulnerable. The safe ones around here have long waitlists
10ilegi,,j5fvl0e,I think you're being too picky for someone who just moved here homeless.  Someone was nice enough to accommodate you with a hotel, and now you want you're own shelter for you and your pet.  That's not going to happen.  Stop making excuses and start calling around.  The sun is shining here today,, but the next storm is right around.
10ilegi,,j5fw82b,I'm not sure how wanting basic human dignity and survival is being too picky. I have disabilities. That's not something I can control. People failing to understand that doesn't change it or address the problem. Also, I'm not sure how having moved from one location to another matters, when we have a constitutionally confirmed right to travel in the US. People are people and have inherent rights as people no matter where they go.  This is not a situation I've chosen. I haven't had any other meaningful options. I have called around as much as I can. I have tried very hard to navigate the system for months. I appreciate any and all information and advice I can get, but if you're coming at me with judgment for having less means than you or someone else, then you're part of the problem not the solution.
10ilegi,,j5fzbrv,You can stop using your "disability" as an excuse or to get people to feel sorry for you.  I remember months ago people on this sub telling you explicitly DONT MOVE TO DENVER because of your disability and the harsh Winters.    You told everyone they didn't know what they were talking about and here we are today.  Come to your senses and start calling around today.  Don't wait until it's too late.  https://www.facebook.com/reel/731475824946766?s=yWDuG2&fs=e&mibextid=Nif5oz
10ilegi,,j5gwokm,Sometimes people make the wrong choices, don't have to rub it in and make it worse man. I'm usually a nice person but I am tired of seeing people treat other people like crap because they fucked up something, sometimes people fuck up things and sometimes you try to do everything perfectly and it doesn't work out.
10ilegi,,j5g17tu,I'm not trying to get people to feel sorry for me. I'm trying to find solutions that work.  A disability is an excuse. That's why it's a disability. It means that a person can't do what other people can do because of something physiological about them that they don't generally have much control over. That's what a disability is. The failure of people to understand something that basic is responsible for a large portion of human misery in the world ‚Äî and not just for the disabled people directly hurt by it, but it reverberates through the whole society.  I was getting a lot of information from different places. I didn't have a lot of options. I rolled the dice and lost. You can keep kicking down at other people in difficult situations, or you could be part of the solution and try to fight back against the city that's making things miserable for all of us. If you want to project that misery on other homeless people, then you're no better than the liberal NIMBYs, cops, and politicians screwing us all over. Makes me wonder what you're even doing here. If homeless people can't have solidarity among themselves, then we really are screwed over. Stop blaming the people getting stepped on by the system and start placing the blame on the system where it belongs, otherwise things will just continue to get worse.
10ilegi,,j5gwb21,notice 'denver' is in his name...he comes here to hate on the homeless
10ilegi,,j5imdrh,I'm going to be straight up and blunt here, please read this as feedback for you: Disabilaty isn't an excuse, never has been never will be. Reality check is that you made a choice that seems like it was a mistake and now you're facing issues.  An animal may be considered a service animal under certain circumstances, you do NOT need a doctor to sign off on this if you're in a situation such as now.  Does your animal help you emotionally such as calm you down or help when you are having a sensory overload issue? Do you have a physical issue such as getting up and down and is suppor5ed by your animal?  If yes to either of these then you can get into a shelter with the animal because legally it asists with a medical condition that is helped by the animal and is not emotional such as depression. However the legality of the animal is that if it's a dog or not. There is no such thing as a service cat or bird or lizard or whatever other animal you pick. Miniature Horses are the only other legally accepted animal.  Back to Disability, just because you or I have an issue doesn't give you an excuse to lean on your condition.  I have 2 bad vertebrae in my neck and an Unspecified nerve disorder that causes lockups.  I push myself daily and strive to be the best I am capable of being. I don't let my issues get in my way and when they do I just push on.     You can't let your issues control your life or get in your way.  You want to use your Disability as a crutch and that's obvious, you allow it to get in your way and fail to use what you have at your disposal to your advantage.  Your Disability should give you priority and certain protections within reasonable scope of the law and laws. Using your Disability as an excuse is bullshit. I use mine as the truth as to why I can't always do things, there's no excuse there only fact.  Movie recomendation: Fundamentals of Caring This might help give you a new look on things.    As people have said and attmpted to get you to understand you absolutely need to call the number listed and see about getting into a shelter. You'll be able to help yourself easier by accepting the hands up that are being given to you here on reddit and physically.

10ilegi,,j5ifqdu,Well said dear friend!
10ilegi,j5irohl,,I wouldn't call it a stupid idea. In your frozen shoes I might think the same way. It's probably impractical though. And dangerous. If the structure doesn't collapse and suffocate you, hypothermia might do you in. Please stay safe and let us know if you've decided to follow through on this plan.
10ilegi,j5ii7r5,,Random aside, LGBTQ people have to stop fearing red states. Are you worried they will make it illegal to marry one day? The federal government ensured they can't. Literal physical survival at stake and people worried about the politics of a state.  Its absurd. It's warm enough to survive and some like Oklahoma have expanded Medicaid. Normal people do not care. I live in tx. There are two tg people on my street. At the corner store, there is a flamboyantly gay man who everyone loves and a tg man.  They are not harassed by Greg Abbott. Lol. He's a turd but what can he do besides say tg teens can't play sports in public schools?
10ilegi,,j5imppo,Are you for real? Do you have any idea of the dangers of being LGBTQ+ in a heavily red area? I mean, even here in Colorado, which is fairly liberal, we had an LGBTQ+ club shot up very recently. You might remember that, since it made the national news. Multiply that danger times 10 in an area where everybody thinks you're a threat to their children because you're not cis-het. I made it in my previous state because I flew under the radar so that only a select few people knew I was LGBTQ+, and also that was before people were really being whipped into a frenzy over it like they've been for the past several months. But remaining stealth like that also takes a serious psychological toll, which can also be detrimental to survival.  Currently, there are states trying to pass legislation that would basically make it illegal for trans people to get hormone therapy, dance in public, or be around children. That's not an exaggeration. This shit is getting dangerous and deadly.
10ilegi,,j5ir1ge,>Colorado, which is fairly liberal, we had an LGBTQ+ club shot up very recently. You might remember that, since it made the national news.  Colorado Springs is a military, red neck, gun toting part of Colorado.  Denver is not that.  No where near that. The  LGBTQ community is strong and active.
10ilegi,,j5kbi3e,That has no bearing on the point I was making.
10ilegi,,j5kezzo,Dallas does also, just to name one example of a liberal city in a red state. The rhetoric from certain people in the media is disgusting, for sure, but I don't see any danger. I have a trans friend in Oklahoma and no one is bothering her. It's not even a liberal town but ... I think media hype is giving people a wrong impression. I have two trans neighbors on my street in Texas. No one is bothering them. Oklahoma has proposed a bill limiting hormone therapy up to age 26. Hasn't passed. Probably won't. Would be deemed unconstitutional if it did. Texas has not proposed to limit adults medical treatment. I don't think the liberal media is doing anyone any favors acting like trans are on the verge of being taken into camps.
10ilegi,,j5kgb8e,I think you're making a lot of assumptions here, including about how I've come to my conclusions, that just aren't true. And it's really dangerous here to rely on your own personal experience to try and prove a negative. Yes, it's certainly possible for an LGBTQ+ person to live in a deep red area and never experience a problem. But you only have to roll a miss once.
10ilegi,,j5ki4y1,I'm worried about you getting frostbite üò≠

10ilegi,,j5im4m8,I don't know. Probably die on the street.
10ilegi,,j5irfnk,What type of camping gear do you have on hand?
10ilegi,,j5kcij1,I'm actually fairly well outfitted. I was a prepper before I became homeless, I've had a lot of people help me out monetarily, and I used the large chunk of money I got recently in part to update my gear. I have a decent three person tent, I have a heavy comforter and a cold weather sleeping bag that can together keep me warm down to below zero, and I now have water wicking under layers to help keep me warm, along with a new set of good boots. Basically, if the cops would leave me alone and let me set up, I would be mostly fine regardless of what the wind and weather does.
10ilegi,,j5kf2gp,A lot of our gear is similar.  So I know you know how to handle yourself on the streets.  But the cops are gonna be cops.  That cold front was probably a godsend to them.  It did the job they couldn't do.
10ilegi,,j5kfa88,Yup. Cops are really the one thing that I can't account for. Not without a good stealthy place to hide. That's my only defense against them.
10ilegi,,j5ih56j,If he did would he be asking about a snow shelter?

10ilegi,,j5kdcsc,I'm sorry.  I wasn't trying to out you.  A lot of your profiles are pretty public.  I just assumed you were out there.  No need to go any further.
10ilegi,,j5kfltn,You're fine. It's really not a big deal. I haven't made an attempt to hide who I am.
10ilegi,,j5kfvdn,I donated a few bucks awhile back from your tik tok videos.  That's where I remembered you from.
10ilegi,,j5kgjia,I appreciate that. I just hate to constantly have my hand out, and getting money wasn't my purpose for making the videos in the first place. I really appreciated everyone's help, but I consider the videos failures because they haven't spurred any change to the larger situation.
10ilegi,,j5kjs2a,Have you tried to get disability?
10ilegi,,j5kk7sw,Yes. The first time there was a glitch in the system, and I got screwed over. Then more recently, I was fortunate enough to get a good chunk of money, but that also disqualified me. Mental health issues make it very difficult for me to make phone calls and navigate the system, especially when they make it complicated and bureaucratic. I need to try again, but I need help, probably in the form of a caseworker.
10iikdn,j5g4pyq,,The plane ticket wasn't a gift, it was a not-so-subtle hint that they need their space. Without you in it.   Sorry about the PTSD; whatever the root, that's rough. I think you're being a little ungrateful calling your hosts petty, though. A year is a long time to try to nuture and protect someone, even if it's only by providing an indoor space. It sounds to me like you really need an advocate who can help you with the disability and services and help teach you how to navigate these things yourself.  Good luck.
10iikdn,,j5k4fee,I don't agree that the OP was being ungrateful. Based on what the OP stated, i think his friends were playing a psychological game on him. Because if they wanted rent to begin with, they would have asked for it upfront (in the form of a contract) - not wait 12 months later to "evict" him and claiming that he didn't pay rent for 12 months...  So, his friends either wanted to appear as though they are doing him a favor or maybe they do care but they realize they have made an overcommitment (12 months is pretty generous).  But they "evicted" him because he wasn't able to use his "gift" that his friends gave him (a plane ticket as a gift???). And it's not a coincidence that the friend they were sending him to cancelled on him. We see that the OP didn't pick up the subliminal message initially (his friends wanted him out), however, it is not difficult to simply communicate that you want someone out of your place. No need for the mind games.  I think a written agreement should have been established, from the beginning, to better protect OP. Although, we can agree that we don't know the extent of his situation, i don't think it's okay to dismiss the fact that people can, indeed, be shallow. It's possible that the OP could have done something to trigger them, but either way, we don't know for sure. But I don't think OP has a reason to lie about his experiences because people can be that shallow.
10iikdn,,j5k8hsb,Here is another take.  The OP has some very kind friends who allowed him/her to stay there for free for a year.  The OP, after a year was not progressing to a point to stand on his/her own.  This was causing tension in the household.  The friends didn't want the OP to be shoved out into the cold so they talked to a mutual friend who agreed to take in the OP.  The friends bought the OP a plane ticket so the OP could get to the new location.  Something happened; either the friend got cold feet and changed their minds, or the OP didn't get on the plane or both.  I think the OP needs more help than what friends can provide.
10iikdn,j5fj0js,,As someone with cptsd sometimes people get tired of it. They probably thought it would change or go away but it‚Äôs not a cut. It‚Äôs a chronic condition that requires ongoing and continuous care. Even when you cannot get the care from a professional you must take care with your own mental state and the ways in which it taxes you.  Even paying rent it gets exhausting. I often keep many aspects to myself among friends for this reason. I don‚Äôt want to tire them out. Damned if I‚Äôm not constantly exhausted mentally and emotionally but I don‚Äôt want to tire them out too.   So I curse the internet instead! (Lol)  You stayed rent free for a year and froze getting on the plane. That can be a valid response however you need to understand that at this point your like a house guest who stayed months longer than they thought it would take.  $200.00 is a lot of money.   While they can‚Äôt legally evict you for the agreement had, and while they cannot even sue you for a gift you never agreed to pay back in the first place, it would be best to leave.   Interpersonal relationships can survive many things but they cannot survive contempt, and it sounds like you are now in a contemptuous situation and relationship.   I‚Äôve had people claim to have ptsd to me for there reason for not trying and I‚Äôve never had a lick of patience for it.   You‚Äôve made no headway as far as they are concerned.   I understand it‚Äôs easy to get lost in your own head but it looks like you had the opportunity to get on the plane and now you need to call 211 and find a shelter.   What things you have, take them or find something to do with them.  Talk to them and let them know three days isn‚Äôt legal even for a legal eviction(a legal eviction is five days, not three, and a judge will laugh them out of the courtroom).   If you need this much support truly, and have Medicaid etc, you could also try to take yourself to a mental hospital but‚Ä¶ speaking from what I know‚Ä¶ that may make things worse rather than better depending on how that goes. However, on the off chance you don‚Äôt get a shitty one they can even help with getting you assistance and even in a sixteen hour program etc.
10iikdn,j5fq50m,,It's time to leave. Unless you're paying rent or helping with bills and food, it's likely that your friends can't afford for you to stay any longer. They're not being petty; they're being realistic.  They were very generous to let you stay for a year but, IMO, that's long enough for you to have changed some things in your life to prepare you to live independently.  FYI, I stayed with a cousin for nine months after I left a homeless shelter. But I paid rent, helped with bills and groceries, helped with chores, picked up her kids from school, took care of her dogs ... and the arrangement was still hard on all of us. It's stressful bringing a new person into your home, even when that person tries not to be a burden.  What have you been doing to get treatment for PTSD? If you have a counselor, they might be able to help you find shelter. Go back to the doctor or whomever diagnosed you with PTSD and ask for help with getting services. Call 211. Google shelters. But whatever you do, thank your friends for supporting you for a year and promise to pay it forward when you can.
10iikdn,j5f9yzm,,You have been there long enough and have wore out your welcome. I would have taken the plane ticket it was a nice jesture and now they have wasted $200. Your problems are not their problems. Call 211 for resources.
10iikdn,j5g9ntd,,You do not owe them for the gift. They can evict you even if you were staying for free with their permission. Generally someone who doesn't pay rent, like someone living with their parents, are effectively considered a month to month tenant under the law. So whatever law in your area that apply to month to month tenants applies to you. They can decide to end you tenancy with proper notice even if it was agreed you stayed for free. But you owe them nothing for the gift. The law does not allow people to give gifts and then sue to get it back except under very limited circumstances.  I would need to know the location, or city, to know whether 3 days are sufficient. Probably not unless they are claiming a for cause eviction. But the thing is that they can't kick you out after 3 days. To legally kick you out they have to wait till the notice ends, file an eviction with the court, and then have the judge authorize a forceful eviction. I wouldn't push it so far as to get a court ordered eviction, but it might be possible to buy more time than 3 days. With a location and exactly what the notice to vacate said I could probably say more.
10iikdn,j5h8n2h,,what was the gift? and its a little confusing but they gave you an eviction letter ? something is not right , but obviously they want you out, i dont think you are forthcoming with all details but it sounds like a terrible situation and i send you prayers.
10iikdn,j5k0b1r,,I don't know the extent of your situation, however, I do know, in general, that people do use and abuse others under the guise that they're helping you. Unfortunately, that's what comes with being homeless and with living in their place for free. I think if you were paying rent, things might have been different. Maybe. But when people know that you're depending on them, they feel in control and it feels good to them.   You had received a written eviction but never had a lease. Was there some kind of agreement written on paper? Or was it just a verbal agreement? Having things documented can protect you. But in my opinion, you can't claim legal rights regarding eviction if there wasn't any established agreement (a lease) to begin with. We need more information here.  Overall, i would interpret this as they wanting you to leave their house. I mean, since it's their place, they have a right to ask you to leave. However, i know you are concerned about finding a safe place to stay to continue with your PTSD treatment. In this case, i don't think you have a lot of time to think this through (as you had indicated). So the best thing to do is to get into a shelter for now.  Hope things work out for you.
10iikdn,j5ehqok,,Of course the friend I was suppose to stay with over Christmas ‚Äúfelt so bad‚Äù they‚Äôve now abandoned me and won‚Äôt speak to me at all, to so I don‚Äôt have them either. Everything has fallen apart in less than a week.
10iikdn,,j5eui1z,It sounds like you wore out your welcome after a year.  Have you called 211 or located any shelters?  Are you working with a therapist or social worker?
10iikdn,,j5i6c7v,Maybe that friend is concerned that you'll end up staying with them for a year. I understand that you need support, but expecting someone to take care of you until you feel like you're ready to leave is pretty ballsy.
10ifq3v,j5eyow1,,What city in alberta?
10ifq3v,,j5gc07y,actually from a small town but edmonton is the closest
10ifq3v,j632pxu,,I'm in Manitoba.  I wouldn't say we're "better" than where you are, other than we're not "there" so.....  I guess I'd have to ask what you're looking for?  If you want housing, you need some type of job so you can pay the rent, buy food, etc.  There are a lot of job vacancies here, especially in the tourism and health services sectors but I am seeing a lot of low wages and part time hours so it's difficult to manage.  We do have Manitoba Housing, which is subsidized housing but their waiting list is LONG.  Like years long and I don't see them as a viable option.  What skills do you have?  Are you a nurse, a librarian, a bus driver, a cook, a maid, a........?
10ifq3v,,j6333qg,i don‚Äôt really have any skills, but i do have my license to work at a dispensary. i was gonna use my parents camper to stay in town so i could actually work but that seems so stupid to do. i only worked as a teen but don‚Äôt have any references. a lot of under the table type of jobs‚Ä¶   i‚Äôm not looking for better, i‚Äôm looking for a place where i can actually try to make my life better. this time i don‚Äôt want to even try talk to anyone from my family, cause they always ruined every chance i‚Äôve had.
10ifq3v,,j6358cc,By "dispensary" do you mean cannabis or a medical pharmacy?  It's about 4 am here (I'm a night owl) but day time hits, I'll start googling after work and see what I can find.  I do know there are social service agencies like Manitoba Possible and REES (Reaching E-Quality Employment Services) that help people with disabilities find jobs.  It might be worth reaching out to them and seeing what services they could offer.  I feel the biggest issue in Manitoba right now, especially Winnipeg (the capital city) is that there aren't a lot of full time jobs.  Tons of part time jobs but it's hard to make a living from part time work when you have to pay rent, buy food/clothes, etc.
10ifq3v,,j633qeh,my head hurts so much cause my abuser fought me earlier tonight, i hate living like this. the stuff i saw on the streets was bad but i kept my peace, i can‚Äôt really do that here cause i get beat up no matter what.

10iba0a,j5enuhv,,If possible try and get some money for a sleeping bag or a tent like the other guy said in the comments. Everyone needs sleep, if you will keep taking energy drinks and avoiding sleep for a long time you might start hallucinating and/or start developing health issues.  Sorry that you are in this situation but please don't give up, I hope that things will get better for you soon.
10iba0a,j5fi3dh,,Hey newly homeless friend. No worries, you got this.  Free Caffeine: Grocery stores/gas stations/donut palace/mechanics/motels - any place that offers it generally won‚Äôt charge you for a black coffee if you bring your own mug & you display good manners & charm. Treat people well.  Places Where you need to be hanging around more: Churches/Temples/Worship/Any Addiction meetings, followed next by Civic areas like courthouse/shelters/soup kitchens. These are places where folks will passively or actively help you. Be kind, helpful, and more involved in helping them out and they can move mountains for you.   When you need solitude & privacy ride the bus/subway. Underpasses, highway areas, be sure to sleep with insulation between you and the ground, followed by quiet empty parks (careful though for Thieves, Karens & Cops) Lastly shitty industrial areas (but only if you‚Äôre well supplied & street smart) are pretty deserted & no one cares if you‚Äôre not destructive.   These are three ‚Äúsafer‚Äù places to hang out when you‚Äôre homeless. People/cops are less likely to fuck with you around these areas. You can put together a few moments of peace here. Use it to strategize: 1. Work on securing a permanent address. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs your bf‚Äôs cousin or a gas station. If it can receive mail, it will make everything easier. 2. Get set up with social services, do NOT inadvertently disappear from the system, because of your homelessness. 3. Keep trying, keep pan-handling, keep connecting to people, don‚Äôt give up! If you have trouble connecting, try a reporter or journalist. It‚Äôs important that the voiceless be given a platform. Your story is important.   Once you disappear from society‚Ä¶you may end up in the classic scene‚Ä¶found dead, likely from exposure behind the S-Mart down the street, forever silent & forgotten.  Cheers sugar, hopefully you can get some rest soon.
10iba0a,j5efopn,,Please try and keep yourself as safe as you can. Try help.org or maybe any charity place you can find. Maybe a Red cross can help even with warm clothing or blankets.
10iba0a,j5dsi3g,,Fly a sign, get some money, get a sleeping bag and a coat. It's not hard. You don't have to sleep in doorways and McDonald's, there are plenty of areas in parks and on the outskirts where you can get a good night's rest without being bothered.
10iba0a,j5ezuby,,You do need sleep. Sleep is very important to your health and mentality. Just make sure you don't push yourself too much and fall asleep at a bad time.
10iba0a,j5exli0,,That‚Äôs why so many people that are homeless get hooked on meth. I was turning it down at the end of my homeless days.
10iba0a,j5f79rb,,I‚Äôm going to repeat the only good advice in here:  Find shelter, and get some sleep.  The human brain requires sleep.   You can quite literally die without it.    Way before that happens, you‚Äôre going to start making mistakes.    The streets don‚Äôt forgive.   You will come to harm if you don‚Äôt get some sleep.  Full stop.
10iba0a,j5et5i3,,If there‚Äôs any churches in the area it‚Äôs worth asking if they have any winter coats, hats, or sleeping bags. A lot of churches do coat drives for donating, and some might even be able to go buy you one. Hats are a must because you lose a lot of heat through your head. Look for tall bushes and overhangs. A lot of buildings have overhangs that will keep you relatively dry, and if you‚Äôre behind a bush nobody driving past will notice. Just make sure you get up when the sun comes up so nobody calls the cops on you
10iba0a,j5h8xot,,You've already tried too much. Trying not to sleep is a death wish. I understand sleeping in extreme cold is also a death wish. Double up your efforts for appropriate shelter, you could go to extremes like the police, but maybe do whatever less adventurous people do in your area!
10iba0a,j5f4po3,,You need to sleep. Try and get into a shelter
10iba0a,j5g5xtg,,It's not realistic to just stay awake to fight homelessness.  Get some gear and then get some rest.
10iba0a,j5hgm71,,This is so unhealthy and not ideal. You need to find a place you can sleep where you won't get shooed. This can can easy if you are comfortable sleeping around others. Just find the local sleep spots where other homeless stay. There are also all sorts of incognito places that will be tucked away where you can at least sleep, maybe while sitting, for at least a while. You need to be creative and adventurous though. You need to find spots where other people almost never go. You can also do a rotation to try and find businesses that WON'T shoo you while you are sleeping. My mom works for the state and she told me her building had a homeless man sleeping in the doorway. He would come after the building closed and would leave before anyone came in the morning, generally. People only saw him rarely and all the staff, being social workers and welfare workers, were very sympathetic to homeless people. A couple people left him stuff like food every once in a while.  You really need sleep. Sleep deprivation is insanely damaging to your body and mind. I'm not just talking about staying awake for days straight. Chronic sleep deprivation will make you vulnerable to infection, it will worsen or trigger any mental health disorders you may or may not have, and it will cause a lot of physical pain over time. I dealt with sleep deprivation even just sleeping in a shelter since they open so late and close so early. Warming centers, if one exists in your city or town, will generally allow sleeping during the day until they shut down. I'd recommend going to any shelter or other homeless outreach place(welfare offices and employment offices will often know, many churches will as well) to ask people where you can find one.  Stimulants will work. If you are an addict and are already consuming drugs, meth or another amphetamine will keep you awake and keep you warm if you get enough calories each day. If you don't eat enough it can hasten hypothermia and weight loss though. I had a meth problem for a long time and I could sweat in a blizzard while high. I'm pretty fat so I had the fuel to burn.   You really need sleep tho. Don't do drugs if ur not already an addict. If you are an addict, try to go to treatment. It will give you a bed and a month and often housing resources. My local treatment center prided itself on "almost never discharging a patient who literally had no place to go but the streets". I don't know where you are so your mileage will vary.  And yes you build tolerance to caffeine rapidly. Your body adapts to it really quickly and it won't work.
10iba0a,j5digd8,,Just read a book or  keep chatting in this thread
10iba0a,,j5dvcby,Don't think it's that easy.
10iba0a,,j5etpep,But you made it through the night
10iba0a,j5gmfex,,Caffeine pills are quite cheap and each pill is normally 200mg of caffeine, which is equal to about 3.5 cups of coffee. If you really want to stay awake without abusing illegal stuff, figure out how long your sleep cycles are and how many you need each night - mine are two hours long and I need at least 4 - and you can split them up through the day. They call it polyphasic sleep. You do have to kinda nail down meal timing and stuff for it work as well as it could. Also, make sure you hydrate as much as you can. Caffeine can be a diuretic and if you don't have enough water, it won't work as well. Frankly, you can also try Sudafed/pseudoephedrine with your coffee, as it's an amphetamine derivative, and yes, it will work like that. Red bull and anything that has a bunch of B-vitamin derivatives will work in the very short term, but don't rely on them - it's going to work much better if you just take B-vitamin supplements. Honestly, if you can afford it, hit up Grocery Outlet, grab some caffeine pills and B0-vitamins and it should help keep you up.   Finally, if you want to go the energy drink route, there is one called "Double Dragon" if I remember the name right and it has some astronomically high amount of caffeine. Back before I knew how bad it was to mix caffeine with my meds, I would hit a few of those when I wanted to stay up super late and shit, and whoa. They also cost like a dollar. I had to get them at Winco, if you have those in your area.

10i5jrg,j5qhxyw,,Don't buy anything quickly. Think about it. Don't listen to anyone telling you "You need to buy this" To be honest $11 is so little I think you shouldn't buy anything with it right now. For example, don't buy a nalagne. You can use/reuse old plastic water bottles. You can get one later if you really need it. Save that $11 for something YOU need when you actually need it.  If you only have $11, you'll quickly realize that food and water is much more important most important amenities. Are you covered for that at the shelter?  If you're buying stuff, BUY IT USED. Don't buy new. Craigslist, Facebook marketplace is your haven for now. I'm assuming you have alot more time than money. Also if you have a phone, register for facebook marketplace. (Craiglist is dead) If you are not active on facebook or have never registered before; you'll need to get approved. It took me a couple days to get on it because I deleted my FB accounts years before. (Maybe consider a battery bank if you don't have one already.)  SCOUR marketplace for free things, cheaps things. Be nice and courteous when messaging sellers; people are really nice if you are nice to them. You may be able to swing deals or even get free things.  Goodluck, don't spend that $11 just yet.

10i4kxy,,j5qfpy5,Apply for ALL the gigwork stuff for now like ubereats, doordash, postmates. If it's pending it might not show up yet. They do criminal background checks but its automated.     Once you're approved they don't constantly do criminal background checks so you'll be good. Just apply for them all so you have some backups later down the road. It doesn't mean you have to use the apps right now.  Having said that, gigwork is probably one of the hardest hit right now due to recession. But some money is better than no money right?

10i4f2r,,j5l65ke,I agree with everything you said. Only 1) there is no such thing as a "cheap apartment" in San Francisco and 2) I'm aware others are suffering more than I am - but if I don't do SOMETHING... well I'm not ruling out a more dire outcome, whatever it takes to escape. Thinking about whether my own pain is more or less deserving of care than others is a pointless exercise - frankly I'm sure I'm less deserving and likely less competent than most - but I'm just not somebody else. No, therapy isn't the answer here and it's not about self-awareness etc etc.

Couch surf or short term rental until it's settled. Good luck, and no, sleeping in a Honda Fit is not an option, if your back isn't sore already, it will be.

You can run the car all night using the climate control because it runs off the hybrid battery. But if you must live in your Honda I would suggest looking for videos on YouTube of people's setups that live out of their cars. Hybrid cars are better because the engine barely runs and people won't notice you as much. I would suggest staying at 24 hour gyms or places you feel comfortable. You'll need window covers. I would suggest weathertech, they are custom made. Use Google maps and use the satellite view to scan potential parking areas. Your biggest challenge will be figuring out where to sleep at night. I stay at truck stops and 24 hour gyms and occasionally apartment complexes. Good luck!

10i4f2r,j5i832u,,Long term you need a divorce, short term you need stability and that is going to require income.  SF CoL is stupid high - you'd be better off in Sacramento/Roseville/Sutter/Humboldt/Chico.  There is a *reason* why all those areas are getting hit by an influx of people from San Fran & San Diego.  You can pick up a manufactured home for around 50k in a sunset community if you are in your 60's - that's what I'd do if you can manage. Hell, looking abroad, Italy and Spain are choice for people who can drop that much on an apartment.  **Wanting to join a Caravan is the call of the Void - do not do that. That is your brain and emotions setting you on a destructive path.** **You can have fun and freedom without joining the RV Caravans.**  Hell, even getting a boat and doing liveabord would be a be a better option than joining the Caravans.  Sign up for some classes or hobbies to meet people and get your mind off your wife/start a new job or do some volunteering.
10i4f2r,,j5i8kye,I am concerned about the "destructive path" thing - it's one reason I'm asking about this, what it takes to avoid that.   I can't move away because of my job.  Yeah I think once I retire, Mexico, Spain or Portugal are good options.
10i4f2r,,j5ia2x4,Check out r/bpdlovedones and those related subs if you haven't.  The thing about the RV Caravans is the rampant drug use and crime - it really *isn't* the place you want to be if you can avoid it. Things have gotten really bad since the opioid epidemic.  It sounds like you mostly need an outlet to keep your sanity? If you're going to do something dumb, consider a (modest and sustainable) boat that you can burn money on and sleep in when things are rough. Or getting the RV, paying through the nose, and going to an actual RV park. Hell, get a gold claim and go camping once a month.  You want to leverage small indulgences and expenditures into maximum returns for your mental health.
10i4f2r,,j5l769b,I appreciate being taken seriously - thank you it means a lot.     I'll look at the BPD sub. It's just that I spent SO much time trying to figure this out. Going from what \*I\* was doing wrong to therapy to labeling her to just "how can I survive this and not hurt anybody too much?". I've made many crap, self-abolishing choices along the way - but it is what it is and I still hope to find a way.
10i4f2r,j5cl6w6,,Get a car...
10i2f01,j5c7949,,Yeah my understanding is homeless has nothing to do with it. Expedited is for income under like 150
10i2f01,j5c8dnj,,Still kinda blows though all we trying to do is eat,
10hywgg,j5bj2ae,,Potatoes are nightshade family, Solanum, and the plant is poisonous. So they have less leeway than most other foods.
10hywgg,,j5bnxk3,This üëÜ also dont eat green potatoes. High levels of solanine
10hywgg,,j5dy7sb,TIL, thank you
10hywgg,j5br8yf,,Everyone has a different tolerance too. My lower digestive system hates them
10hywgg,j5chfxy,,Shit happens.
10hywgg,,j5ckbt9,Yup quite literally.
10hywgg,j5dmsna,,They are ok if just squishy from dehydration, but if rotten mushy black or smelly dont't. If they are green then you need to do a boil on them, other cooking methods won't get the nasty out.
10hywgg,j5f1e0k,,I ate out of trash cans by fancy restaurants and pizza places. Safer than that. McDonald‚Äôs fries are made to last for years fresh out of their trash it‚Äôs great.
10hxqnc,j5b8kue,,I don't have any advice, but just wanted to say that you are an amazing boss and human being.  Thank you for helping him.
10hxqnc,,j5bmh08,I wish I could help you all ‚ô•Ô∏è
10hxqnc,j5b7lgw,,You're doing some good things already.   A Mr. Buddy heater, a 15lb propane tank, and a 10 foot hose to connect the two will do wonders for heat. Get the square one, not the round one that sits on top of the green 1lb cylinders. They're designed to be used for tents/indoors. The round ones aren't very good.  A two burner camp stove, a pot, pan, and some cooking utensils will solve the cooking problem. And he can screw the hose for the heater into the stove.  Look for a free bicycle place near you. Sometimes there are places that will give you/let you build a bike if you do a bit of work for them.  A 0¬∞ sleeping bag, a comforter and a pad to put between his bag and the floor/ground will do wonders for comfort.  Hygiene and laundry... Usually there is a mission/church around that does laundry and has showers for the homeless.  Thanks for being one of the helpers!
10hxqnc,,j5blz9l,Is this all stuff I could get on Amazon? I‚Äôm not the most technically sound person. Kind of embarrassing, but I am unsure of what half the things you described are. I‚Äôm going to do some research based on your response!
10hxqnc,,j5bv0eg,Does he have access to a water spigot? I used to do laundry in a 5 gallon bucket using a new toilet plunger with a few holes drilled in it.   It works surprisingly well. But you need a fair amount of water.
10hxqnc,,j5bxlm5,Good question. I will ask him
10hxqnc,,j5fel42,I was going to ask about access to running water and (ideally) electricity...I know the latter is unlikely but I thought maybe since you said it was a shed there might be a 110V outlet somewhere in there.  Thank you on behalf of the homeless community, if only we could clone you. üòÇ
10hxqnc,,j5bmah5,Either Amazon or Walmart. Once you look them up you'll see what they are. Let me know if you need some help.
10hxqnc,,j65c3yz,Facebook market place ‚Ä¶ camp stoves are super cheap on there .
10hxqnc,,j5bk3m4,For hygiene they have propane in-line showers. A cassette toilet goes long way to feeling human. There are also small hand agitated clothes washers for clean clothes.
10hxqnc,j5bjhbe,,How close are you to Columbus? That city is a Housing First city, and may have more resources for vouchers than the service providers where you live.
10hxqnc,,j5bl4ib,We are basically in downtown Dayton. I will look into that, I really appreciate the info!
10hxqnc,,j5t8x4f,Call 311 and ask for resources and they should be able to guide you. Get him a cooler to store food ...helps with saving a few bucks . I'm in Columbus and there are a ton of resources here...eviction food, toiletries and help. Call home full and see if he can get a caseworker ....they helped me a lot.
10hxqnc,j5c3te4,,Can you purchase a used washer and dryer and have them installed at work? This can be very handy for shop towels.
10hxqnc,,j5c4akh,I actually love this idea. I just told Cintas to fuck of and fired them last week actually üòÜ so this could really help us!
10hxqnc,,j5eq89w,If he buys it for his business, it can be tax write offs ;)
10hxqnc,j5dj12u,,You are an awesome boss.  I would work for you any day.  Hygiene and laundry would be my first thought, especially laundry since he is in an abandoned shed.
10hxqnc,j5beg9i,,It's party money. He could rent a weekly/ monthly motel with enough money
10hxqnc,j5c8rcm,,bicycles are $30-$50 on the used market. look on craigslist or facebook marketplace.  Buy him a bicycle with a half decent chain and lock, and let him figure out the rest.  A 70% or higher wool blanket would be useful. any other type of blanket NO.
10hxqnc,j5d3mlm,,You can find bikes on like Craigslist or local buy nothing groups too
10hxqnc,,j5d3pv3,Ask around in the community too if you can someone probably has one sitting around that they don‚Äôt use
10hxqnc,j5dbn06,,Do you have FaceBook? Post locally and see if there is an outreach program that can help..they usually get bikes and stuff. Thanks for helping him.
10hxqnc,j5grr67,,You are doing all you can. I‚Äôm an atheist but I still believe in angels. You‚Äôre proof
10hxqnc,j5bs4uo,,If he has a job, and has been sober for over 3 years why is he not able to do any of this for himself? Even if he makes a low wage, if he currently doesn‚Äôt have to pay rent or other bills, shouldn‚Äôt he have been able to save a decent amount of money?
10hxqnc,,j5bxfr3,He‚Äôs almost considered elderly at this point. You‚Äôd be surprised at the hurdles people with felonies have to go through after prison. He makes above minimum wage, but without having anywhere to cook or store food, he eats out every day. He does pay his own phone bill, and he pays for health, dental, and vision insurance. He also occasionally pays for a motel if he has leftover money. The only assistance he really needs is finding a landlord that accepts felons. He told me and the housing advocate that he will pay for it himself.
10hxqnc,,j5bzvxx,Last time I was camping and working it cost ~$700 more per month than it did when I had a place. Everyone thinks "You don't have bills to pay you're set. You can save so mich money." The opposite is actually true and is usually a big barrier to getting housed.
10hxqnc,,j5bwdgv,Mmm it's pretty expensive to live lacking a refrigerator and stove. All your food has to be prepared. Some are better able than others to navigate things like getting to a library to order a bc. And that alone can be very hard. If you call my county and say you need a bc, they'll tell you to bring your id to get it. Or a parent with their Id. To help a homeless person I kept digging feeling there has to be a way out of this loop. Which ended up being state capitol vital records. But as a housed person with wifi and a computer, this still took a while, many phone calls.
10hxqnc,,j5ffxow,Credit record. Nobody rents to low scores
10hxqnc,j5qgps2,,I don't what else to say but maybe share some of this sentiment with him? Maybe just hangout and talk with him too, sounds like you already do.     I feel like if I was in his position I would be terrified of abusing your generosity.      It's incredibly kind of you to go out of your way to help so much ‚ò∫
10hx264,j5c2y4b,,Your question is oddly phrased for someone who wants to find people in order to help them.  It's seems mocking.  I'm sure there are people who have opted into the life but they are NOT the majority.
10hx264,j5b4h9w,,I absolutely do! Fell on hard times financially. Never touched a drug in my life, work a ft job. However, many people out their like too take advantage of homeless people one way or another so those of us that want a better life are very cautious
10hx264,j5b6921,,I am tired of living in a tent
10hx264,j5bkuhb,,That‚Äôs me I stay with an abusive asshole because I cannot support myself on my own full time income. We both work long hours and rent and bills are so expensive each needs the other. I trust that he will work and pay half, I can‚Äôt trust anyone else because every time they don‚Äôt pay or they lose their house.
10hx264,j5f9oe1,,Umm... I'm pretty sure the majority of the homeless population doesn't want to be homeless anymore but their complex circumstances don't make it easy for them to bring themselves out of that hole.   Everyone has their unique reasons as to why they are still homeless. Some of the reasons go as deep as them not having any trust in the system nor in the people who claim that they're there to help.   The stereotyping of homeless people needs to cease so they can get the help that they personally need.
10hx264,j5ba61f,,Me. I want housing.
10hx264,j5ayyyx,,Why do you ask? Genuinely curious.
10hx264,,j5azw2s,I think I‚Äôm supposed to help five people in my lifetime to either get them into affordable housing or prevent someone from losing their home. It‚Äôs like a calling that has been in my heart. I just want some wisdom, so I‚Äôm collecting information.
10hx264,,j5b5hbw,Just a guess... You would probably have to find someone who is newly homeless and freaked out by it.   A lot of us get comfortable (I use the term loosely) not being responsible for a job, place to live, etc. The freedom you find out here after the fear fades is pretty addictive.   Everyone's experience being homeless is different.   There is a contingent of people out there who offer help to the homeless but expect  something fucked up in return. (Sex, domestic slavery, control, etc.) Most of us are very wary of anyone we don't know, or another homeless person we know hasn't vouched for, offering to pull us out if homelessness.   You need to realize that it will take a lot longer than you think to get someone setup and stable. And a lot of us have issues that are not conducive to being a "productive member of society."
10hx264,,j5bm05d,We are about to lose ours. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here learning in this subreddit
10hx264,,j5urfip,Help me then hahaha I'm neet by disability forced to live with my abusive father in FL with my fiance, we want to move out but he takes all our money so we can't save to get out, it's hell, we don't want to end up homeless and I want to get a job and get out of here but my dad literally forces me to stay inside with him all day üò≠
10hx264,j5bf2ri,,PM ME .   IM LIVING IN MY VEHICLE .  I WANT TO GET OFF THE STREETS.  BUT NOT EASY.
10hx264,j5f8hvn,,Go to the local shelter an hour before it opens.  Talk to the people in line.  The addicts don‚Äôt usually line up early.   They‚Äôre getting high around the corner.  The ones lined up early don‚Äôt want to be there.
10hx264,j5bfx0v,,We are going to be homeless next month when our lease ends.  I wish there were more angels like you out there.  Hope you find the people to help.  Check with local churches that minister to the homeless.  They could hook you up with people who need help.

10hx264,j5gr46l,,Ask. Put fliers up. The homeless are still human
10hx264,j5c0vy1,,I hate paying rent
10hx264,j5bj9jc,,Yo. I would very much like to stay off the street. I would very much like to be self-sufficient. I do like the idea of being a bit nomadic and moving around a lot ‚Äî but in my current health, and with the way things work here in this country, being stuck in a situation where you have to live on the street is absolute hell. I want out.
10hx264,j5bpi98,,I would love this as I'm pregnant but someone else needs it more
10hx264,j5ccogb,,Catching a lucky break would be a dream come true,**. someone who works, busy their ass and pays their bills is so deserving of this to happen to them...God Bless the person who ends up with that kind of help...I am this person to a T, however I know I'll never catch a break like that bc I've never been chosen for something like that in my entire life, however I have faith in my Lord Jesus Christ that he will provide for my family and I, even if I have to struggle to get it .. And if an Angel were to bless another human being with the help they should need then Amen and hallelujah!! I hope it's everything they deserve... If you are asking because you want to help someone then God Bless you as well, your are an Angel that so many people need right now and thank you for your help!!
10hx264,j5djfxp,,My husband, kids and I have been staying in a motel since October. We both work but everything goes toward the hotel. I feel like we will never get out. That's why they call it a Hotel Trap. But I have no choice with 2 kids.
10hx264,j87eg26,,me lol,üòÖ please send me help
10hk9bt,j59q9gj,,Yeah. My favorite one is where they insist that you stay there till you get on your feet being super cool about it. Like Saturday: its beers and telling you not to sweat things mi casa es su casa then Monday comes: So uh you can't expect us to take care of you forever bro, whats your plan cause this isn't working.
10hk9bt,,j5ba9h8,Like, really? People start out with good intentions and then realize they only like the idea and feeling of being altruistic, but are not truly about helping.
10hk9bt,,j5cl4gu,Yeah, I hate living with people and being at the mercy of thier ever-changing moods, whims, opinions, etc. It's hard living with another human being because at some point, there's going to be friction and if you are thier guest, it's the door for you!.
10hk9bt,j5an03q,,When you stay with someone, you have to be extremely uncomfortable for your host to feel comfortable with you‚Äîyou gotta earn your keep. You have to mindfully stay out of their way, cook and clean, go out and camp out at Starbucks for a few hours (to look for a job online) when they‚Äôre home so they have their own space from time to time (depends if they‚Äôre introverted or extroverted) and you should bring back a treat for them, and they will *still* think they‚Äôre doing you the big favor. Free rent is like they‚Äôre paying you $500 a month, and you need to earn it with sweat and thoughtfulness. And you have to act grateful about them letting you stay in exchange for you practically being their live-in maid. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just accepting $500+ money from them, robbing them of their own space, and giving them nothing in return. You have to make it a symbiotic relationship for it to be sustainable, otherwise you become their parasite.
10hk9bt,,j5azku1,This is the cold hard truth and in some ways it's understandable. This is how human relationships work for the most part. Relationships and arrangements are often conditional. Rarely will you get someone who truly expects and wants nothing from you.  There will always be expectations to be met even if they are unfairly not always directly voiced.
10hk9bt,,j5barhn,Most are not about truly helping but about what they can get out of it for themselves.
10hk9bt,,j5bakzo,A lot of times even when paying money they see you as intruding their home, kitchen and bathroom. Self-absorbed
10hk9bt,,j5cjw64,Yeah, for sure!. It's always a tight-rope and walking on eggshells because at the end of the day, it's THIER house and the threat of being kicked out over something absolutely petty and ridiculous is always hanging over your head like a dark cloud. "what?...you like chocolate cake?...well, I don't!...there's the door pal!!".
10hk9bt,j59uq8o,,I don't know how to say this politically correctly, so I won't try. Half or more of the offers you'll get while on the street are from people that, one way or another, are batshit crazy. Depending on location, normal people will offer you nothing more than a couple of dollars and a blanket or an old jacket. But crazies, oh yeah!
10hk9bt,,j5bb3i8,That‚Äôs very true. They are not stable. Will turn on you in an instant. No rational.
10hk9bt,j5ah20u,,Yea. I don‚Äôt know why people do this. The only thing I can recommend to u is if they are not being clear in communication and u are not at least 90% sure that a decision is a good move, do not do it. Especially some major move. I have had stuff happen as well but this is my rule now. Always pay attention to the actions of a person first and not just what the say. It‚Äôs a more reliable way to figure out if they are dependable and mean what they say.
10hk9bt,,j5bbswx,I would specifically ask what their expectations are and put them in writing, then there is no convenient memory lapses. Most of them have not thought out the whole helping thing out.
10hk9bt,,j5cbrxf,This üëÜ
10hk9bt,j5bu3y6,,I like that second paragraph you wrote as it would be like  dream come true for many folks.  Never seen this country in the condition it is in today after 64 years of living.  The Struggle is past real, üò™  this is going to be a nightmare soon. I keep having these cooky dreams of those Fema camps and folks rounded up to be forced into them. All part of the grand scheme of things the elite have improvised. Some kind of a evil plot with their population control bs kind of related to Nazi Germany stuff.  Maybe, all of what is happening was created to break the will and spirit of many citizens of America. If that is the case or part of the scheme, it's slowing beginning to have an effect.  Back to your post, I think millions are and going through similar scenarios but in various situations. That last paragraph related to me. I'm somewhere right now I don't want to be. That is my goal, to go back to my homebase and I can do well there.  Sorry for a long answer or post, but my mind is all over the place in these times. Hang in there cause none of this sh*t is getting easier.
10hk9bt,j58zu9t,,I'm currently in a situation like that.  Totally been there.  October of last year, I went to Denver briefly with the last bits of my money to stay with a friend, got locked out because his roommate and I didn't exactly see eye to eye.  My first night sleeping on the streets was there.    I never understood how lack of sleep and exhaustion could be so taxing on your mental health until that night, and the paranoia surrounding finding a relatively safe space to sleep can be when you are out there.  You never know who will turn up, if they'll try to steal your belongings or what.  Recently got an opportunity to stay with family in Virginia, who I never really got along with to begin with.  The same cycle has repeated.  And now I'm getting kicked out on my birthday at the end of the month :/.  The shelter near here doesn't seem too bad and someone is letting me keep my things in a storage facility, so there's a bit of a silver lining at least.  I really hope you can find your silver lining and a better opportunity comes your way.  If you get the chance, there's this audiobook I listened to recently called [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu4QwpQddtg&ab_channel=MzimaAudioLibrary) that really has been helpful. It's about a Jewish doctor fighting to survive in a World War II concentration camp.  It gets dark, but through his suffering he managed to find meaning and hope.
10hk9bt,,j591ib6,That‚Äôs one of my favorite books.
10hk9bt,j5c2z7c,,i wasn‚Äôt homeless staying at a shelter in a small town, but when i moved to my aunts in the city i ended up on the streets. it was just the start i suppose.
10hk9bt,j594xq7,,Yes. Is your friend my ex gf by chance? Full of empty promises. Controlling and abusive. Devoid of genuine empathy...
10hk9bt,,j5bbilj,They want you to be a serf and for you to let them to mistreat you, and lord over you, and for you to be utterly grateful for their abuse.
10hk9bt,,j6qvf0w,Might be mine, state the initials lol
10hk9bt,j5aa9em,,Yes. I really don't like it when they do that.
10hk9bt,j5b7gsj,,yes but everyone is still alive. and its at times more important to see the frens or fam and just make do with how they are making do as well.   instead of seeing it as a waste of time its a experiece to learn from and a time of some reprieve from the reality of homelessness. these are the days of our lives and at times its a adventure one might not want to take but walk the line the best you can. be a resource to others while you are there doing whatever. or staying where ever. a plane or bus ticket is always there if you save or ask a place for a ticket some chruches and orgs are good for that.   i got to sleep in a airport one night and thought staying up all night to use wifi. made the most of the time and foundmore art to create.   but yeah...it can be depressing for a opportunity to sour but still its not the pples fault its just human nature. try to be thankful at every turn of the adventure of housing.
10hk9bt,,j5bbz69,To make your life even harder than is for the adventure? No thanks.
10hk9bt,,j5bg5fh,few things are easy in life. IDK. support to you. no harm meant.
10hk9bt,,j5bzgyg,No harm taken. Take it easy
10hk9bt,j5n3szu,,Yeah...  My mom just did this to me, took $500 from me too for the new place. I'll be stuck outside tomorrow with my dog whatever I can fit into my bag, in a town that's not kind to the homeless where no one around gives a fuck about me.
10hea1o,j58px8b,,I would recommend using it wisely too. My state closed my case and have been trying to reopen it for months; luckily I didn‚Äôt misuse my EBT funds
10hea1o,,j5q9d9m,For sure. Thankfully I've never had issues.
10hea1o,j588sv4,,Good for you
10hea1o,,j5qebly,Sure feels good. Hope all is well üëç
10hea1o,j58r8ju,,I hope everyone knows you can use the ebt card anywhere in the US, not just the state the card was issued.
10hea1o,,j58yoyv,Yeah but you can't get the replacement card sent to another state. OP said they lost the card and just was able to get it back.
10hea1o,,j5gwgt4,But can't you just forward your address?
10hea1o,,j5gwvbw,Not for government stuff
10hea1o,,j5h6lp1,O ok.
10hea1o,,j5q8xts,Send to a homeless shelter or someone you know.
10hea1o,,j5q8uey,You can, but they were kinda hesitant so wouldn't be surprised if get rejected. I'm from Las Vegas, but had them ship it to a homeless shelter in Chicago. Tell them you lost it on the flight. If they ask how long you'll be there say 2 weeks (not sooner because card takes 7 to 10 business days although mine took 5). There's a certain time you can away before they play around with benefits such as removing them.
10hea1o,j5a8f9a,,You're going to be eating good for awhile.
10hea1o,,j5q46q6,Sure am. Hey guess it balances out. Getting good was inconvenient for so long and I'm rewarded with a fantasy lol
10hea1o,j5b7k67,,THATS GREAT!!!! OMG COOL!!! EAT WELL NOURIRSH YOURSELF!!
10hea1o,j5bnq1v,,Nice! That's what EBT should be!
10hea1o,,j5ph5va,I'll take it üòÅ How's yours going?
10hea1o,j5bvdh3,,Yes, they build over time if you don't use it as that card did.  " Let's go buy up us some groceries. Swap ya a bedroom and new queen bed to use."  At least you can eat great for awhile. That's a blessing!
10hea1o,,j5pgbws,For sure. In a weird way it's a balance since had to scramble when didn't have it. Sure variety of options and trades although I'd rather be roughing it since solo is most comfortable. Easy access to food is so underrated. How's your situation?
10hea1o,,j5poei7,Doing that struggle to keep my head above water like so many others. It takes all the income to keep a roof over head, pay the basics and buy groceries. Hurt me bad losing my wife last year to cancer. Lost her income too. Hell out here trying to live on one income.  "The Struggle is Real," doesn't even come close to describing this pitiful economy.  If you barter some of that EBT for cash money with others, you make sure you hang on to that card to go with them.  Hang in there, stay safe and keep the faith!
10hea1o,,j5q29ah,Sorry to hear and she'll be waiting for you. Trust me I understand all that. I've stayed homeless because I think best choice for me regarding kinda escaping those necessities. Don't wanna "reintroduce" myself till guaranteed stability. If I did barter for sure but have zero intention. I'd like to do what another subreddit member did for me is grab some food, chat and then send them off with a bit. Appreciate well wishes! I'm type that tries to display positivity and have fun with whatever I do no matter what. Feel free to contact whenever üëç
10hea1o,j58g9a4,,A bonfire/ barbeque.
10hea1o,,j5qe8k9,Did on 4th of July. Definitely thought of doing charcoal grilling at the park.
10hea1o,j5cwwqm,,My daughter‚Äôs card would not work.  It took almost 6 months of going around in circles to get the problem solved.  I finally got a letter that said use it or lose it and it was nearly $2000 with the pandemic extras.  I called, irritated at the letter because I had been trying to resolve the issue for months.  Talked to a guy, he said no problem and we had a working card in 3 days.  So why couldn‚Äôt the other people help?    If you are homeless buy meal replacement powders, protein powder in favorite flavor, vegetable powders that are also drinks and freeze dried fruit.  You will need a shaker tumbler and water and/or powdered milk.  Then just fill in with simple proteins even if it is those long meat sticks or jerky.  Easy nutrition.  Not cheap but not a problem for you right now.  You can order it on Amazon and have it sent to General Delivery at a post office near you if you are homeless. They take packages. If you have a home stock up on non-perishables.
10hea1o,,j5pfpx5,Tough situation. I feel like the discouragement from difficulty contacting makes some quit or delay. Glad you got it resolved and such an amazing feeling when see that amount. Can understand it now lol. Frustrating thing is how many times I've had to keep calling and asking same thing knowing they were wrong until finally someone who understood came along.  Appreciate the suggestions. Actually a former top athlete so familiar with that strategy, but thanks for letting me know that (some) protein powder actually qualifies for EBT. Thanks for letting me know. And I did just find out Amazon has food available. I'm a huge customer and love their whole variety of shipping options. So my strategy is daily shopping. It's most convenient since I'm living out of a backpack and reusable grocery bag. Hope all is well and feel free to chime in whenever üëç
10hea1o,j58kcs2,,That's a whole Lotta cash.  Heard they go for fifty on the dollar üòâ
10hea1o,,j5a7mfh,What goes for 50 on the dollar ü§®
10hea1o,,j5atuyx,I think if you buy someone $20 worth of groceries, they‚Äôll give you $10 cash? Probably to buy things not paid for by the EBT card.
10hea1o,,j5au773,Ah okay. Yeah that makes sense. I didnt translate 50 to 50 cents so i was wondering what the fuck he was buying 50 of for a dollar üòÇ

10hea1o,,j5ayt9n,Yes it's illegal to sell food stamps , it's a felony and could land you in jail for 1-3 years and a $5000 dollar fine.

10h9zap,j59wimr,,Hey dude. I didn't have an address had an AZ ID and lived in California when I got food stamps. Just go into an EBT office and make an appointment they'll get you everything you need. Also because you're homeless you'll qualify for the restaurant meals program and be able to eat at any restaurants that participate in your area. And hot prepared food is such a rad luxury. Congratulations on your job and upgraded hotel as well!
10h9zap,,j5b0h1o,Yay! Thank you for telling me this!! Last night when I got off work I spent $18 on groceries but was being super cautious about my spending. EBT would be so incredible right now. I had it in 2020 during the pandemic but then I moved and that was a HUGE mistake.

10h7xjf,,j57whdb,Just a heads up on plasma - plasma centers will NOT let you donate if you indicate you live at a shelter, they‚Äôre considered communal spaces where you are more likely to catch transmissible diseases (particularly HIV and other blood borne is what they‚Äôre worried about).  So, do not disclose this to them or they will say no and put you on a list.  You do need an ID, keep your original address on it as long as possible for plasma.  Once you sign up you probably won‚Äôt have to show it every time, though.

At the very least you will need some "j-lube", 2 sticks/bamboo canes, some cotton string for the loop (some mops work really well), washing up detergent (google the best for your area), a sign, a bucket and a hat/tin for donations.  Location is everything. Large parks with cafes nearby are a good choice, or tourist attractions.... make bubbles for 10 mins max then take a break, if you bubble for 30 mins kids will stay for the full 30 and the parents will give you the same amount of money as if they had only been there 10 anyway... take a small break and start again, ideally you want the majority of the previous kids to leave because the parents are unlikely to pay you twice.  Don't forget to directly ASK the people for money afterwards. This can be hard at first but makes a huge difference, you'll need to work out your own style. (I wear a pirate costume and tell the kids to steal their parents wallets, gold rings, car keys etc and stick them in in treasure chest but "I'm homless and broke AF" works too. Make EYE CONTACT  with everyone, they will be more likely to donate.  If you want to go deep (it's a rabbit hole seriously) google "the bubble wiki".

And, by the way, I'm trying to set up a charity that will be doing exactly that, not just helping but solving, one person at a time.

10h7ecm,j5702vp,,It all comes down to your tent.  Check the reviews on your tent before you buy it.  If your tent has a condensation problem in it's design people will definitely complain about it.  Stay away from single layer tents.  They sweat really easy.  Make sure to spray the bottom of your tent and let it cure for two days since you're in a hotel room.  Good luck out there.
10h7ecm,j5baeh5,,If you're able to get stuff like this is worth it, although it can get pricey. But moisture wicking material seems to help a lot, like underarmour brand clothing & brands designed for extended stays in cold. I'd do some research on the proper materials for moisture wicking tents & clothing.
10h7ecm,,j5bjlzw,Thanks to a lucky break, I have some money to throw around right now. Not an unlimited amount, but enough that I'm prepared to drop $200-$300 on a tent at Bass Pro today if I have to to get something decent. Plus some new good boots. If I can get some clothing along these lines too, I think I will.
10h7ecm,j576cnq,,Since we've bought our bigger,  2-layer tent, we haven't had any condensation issues while camping. You can have a change of fresh clothes in an airtight bag (like a big ziplock, or multiple smaller ziplock bags) and change clothes after airing out your tent and then hang them to dry before going out. Turning them inside out might help dry faster.
10h7ecm,j5be1a7,,You mention sweat building up in your clothes -- where is this sweat coming from?  Do everything you can to avoid sweating.  Howevee, our bodies are constantly releasing insensible moisture, and this type cannot generally be avoided.    I would strongly encourage a trip to a laundromat every so often to wash and dry your clothes. (Or if you can afford it every once in awhile, do laundry at airbnb/hotel.)  I think it may be very worthwhile to you.    Like I wrote in a different comment, wool midlayers should help.  Wool fibers absorb moisture and release it when it's dry outside.  If you sweat too much they will get wet, but if there's not too much moisture they will still feel dry even though the fiber has absorbed some moisture.  If I sit around in synthetic clothing I typically get clammy feeling, but not if I'm in silk long undwear and a wool sweater.  Regarding tent -- when I winter camp, the moisture from my breath condenses on the rainfly overnight.  On a nice day, this drips down and sometimes falls straight, where it hits my bug net.  I don't need a nooseeum bug net in winter, but it's very useful for capturing falling condensation!  The drops then roll down the side of the bug net.  If you have a quick dry camp towel, you can wipe down the inside of your tent so you don't get wet brushing the fabric.  Then during the day put the towel outside to dry) eg if you hae a backpack and walk around, attach to backpack.  Denver has very dry air so this should help.  If there's any way to get additional airflow in your tent, withour compromising the privacy you require, go for it.  Some tents have vents at the peak.  Sorry I don't have personal street living experience, but I'll share what I know from winter camping if it helps :-)
10h7ecm,,j5bkegv,I don't know how to not sweat. The sweat is coming from me. Like you said, my body is constantly releasing moisture. Not a lot, but enough that it builds up over time, especially after I've been doing a lot of physical activity that day like walking from place to place on foot, pushing my cart of belongings around. To control this, I would have to take a trip to the laundromat every few days, and that's just not feasible. I have zero income. I have money right now because of the lucky break, but that's going to run out before much longer.  I've been reading a lot about air flow with tents as I've been looking at different models online the past couple of days. I plan to go to Bass Pro today, and I will probably ask a sales clerk about it directly.  And hey, I'll take all the information I can get. Some of it doesn't translate over well to Street living because you have to constantly be on the defensive, but it's still information to consider. Having it in my head means that, if I can find a way to do it at some point, or maybe some kind of work around, I'm more likely to figure that out.
10h7ecm,j575zak,,Natural fibers are far better at keeping warm while still being breathable. Polyester is like wearing a plastic bag, it won't keep you as warm and it won't breath, so sweat builds up. The obvious problem here is that natural fiber clothing is generally much more expensive.  If you are able to find anything wool as a base layer that should help wick the moisture away from your body so it won't cool you down. Avoid cotton, it is cheaper than wool or linen, but it doesn't wick moisture as well and will have the same problem re:sweat building up close to the body. Alternatively, there are some synthetics that are made to wick moisture and keep you warm, those are usually athletic wear made for hiking or something. Wool socks and hiking sock liners, wool Longjohns/long underwear, or any other wool base layer is what I'd look for first, then moisture wicking synthetics as a second choice.
10h7ecm,,j57crwd,I'm autistic, and I have serious sensory processing issues when it comes to touching the texture of wool. However, the athletic gear is something I could look into.
10h7ecm,,j5bbrxu,Word!  I love animal fiber for insulation and thermoregulation, but I rarely can wear next to skin because I find even merino to be itchy (high quality brands like Smartwool, Icebreaker, Karo Traa etc.)  My background is camping/backpacking, which is not the same as sleeping on the street, but there's some overlap.  My solution is to wear really thin REI silk long underwear or really thin Patagonia capeline.  I am sure there are cheaper brands that will do the same for less $ but I don't know them.  I've heard fleece Walmart Cuddl Dudds (sp?) Brand works for clean baselayers for sleeping overnight.  You might want to look into budget Ultralight backpacking/thru hiking (eg hiking straight from Mexico to Canada) gear bc these people are hardcore about carrying very few items that need to function in a variety of environments.    Anyhow, for layers I have very thin silk/synthetic, then on top of that Smartwool 250 or some similar layer.  A wool or cashmere sweater would work just fine.  At a thrift store go through sweaters & search for 100% cashmere or camel if you can find it, or 100% wool.  I buy from resellers online and if there's some moth holes, they will sell for really cheap.   Don't wear anything tight fitting, your initial baselayer can hug your body, but should NOT be tight (eg yoga pants and leggings are bad). Subsequent layers should also not be tight.  On top of sweater can be more sweaters, or a big down puffy etc.  On top of your insulation should be a windproo layer, and if raining, a waterproof layer.    Just beware that anything waterproof or waterproof/breathable will NOT breathe that well, and you'll probably start sweating in it if you are walking/moving.  I also can't wear a wool hat directly on my forehead, so I use polyester fleece for that.  Same thing for scarves -- polyester fleece neck gaiter.
10h7ecm,,j59p29i,You can wear wool on top of flannel or modal fabric.
10h7ecm,j59oex9,,Wow. I tip my hat to you. I fled Colorado for fairer weather.   Be careful. It's a sketchy place. I spent two years there living in a van while they were still testing 5g on the populace, and my friend suffered due to this. People hacked us constantly, and chased us everywhere we went . I was kidnapped, but the police refused to even get my statement.   I'm in Southern California now. It's also treacherous here, but not nearly as weird, and overall the people are more friendly and have a sense of humor that Denver people seemed to lack.  Avoid the men's Salvation Army shelter downtown.  We saw people bussed out of there daily, to where we have no clue. We never saw the same men twice, and most of them appeared to be brain damaged.
10h77ij,j56usb8,,Well, your first step is to understand his situation.  Why doesn't he have a job already? Have you asked him?  How did he become homeless? What chain of events led to it? Have you talked with him about it?  You can't convince him of anything without understanding his situation first. For all you know, he may have very good reasons why he hasn't gotten a job, or why he hasn't been able to get a job ‚Äî unless you've already talked with him about these things enough to ascertain otherwise.
10h77ij,,j5795iu,We've already discussed it before, but I guess not in depth. The reason he couldn't do it before was because he didn't want to leave his dog in his tent all day while he worked because someone could steal him.  My logic is that because he's staying at his parents place right now he should hop on the opportunity to get a job so that he'll have money for any expenses that may come up. Even for furniture, video games, and bills. If he started now he'll have something saved up so that he wouldn't have the anxiety of rather or not he'll be able to meet his needs. There may be a deeper reason as to why he's not jumping on it now like. What if it doesn't work out with his parents. Perfectly logically, but I'm just speaking from a higher perspective. I know that he can be successful. I just wanna see him work towards it.
10h77ij,,j57c0pn,My advice would be to give him a little bit of time to settle in and have some relief from the trauma of being homeless, then perhaps you could talk to him about it. Don't come in hot ‚Äî maybe just ask him if he's been looking at any possible employment, or if he's thought about what his next steps are. Don't push, at least not for the initial conversation. Also, remember that it's his life, and it's not about what you want for him, but what he wants for himself.  There should really only be two reasons why this should be a concern for you at all ‚Äî 1) if his inaction is having a negative effect on someone else (which it sounds like it is) or 2) if there is some issue holding him back from doing what he wants to do, like get a job, that he might need help and support with. It's also important to bear in mind when approaching this that employment is not usually a magic solution to homelessness ‚Äî a lot of jobs nowadays don't pay enough for people to meet their basic needs.  If 1) you established that there isn't anything preventing this person from getting gainful employment, and 2) they are dragging somebody else down because of this ‚Äî then it might not hurt to have a more direct talk with him about it. But make sure you understand the situation thoroughly first. Make sure you know what's holding them back before you address it, otherwise you might end up addressing the wrong issue and getting nowhere. You might still get nowhere, but you'll definitely get nowhere if you go in with the wrong set of assumptions. For instance, if he isn't getting a job because of some trauma that's messing with his head, and you go assuming that it's just because he's lazy, you're likely to get some very, very bad results, and it will be your own fault. If you don't feel up for this, a better alternative might be to connect him with a therapist who could help ‚Äî though, finding a good therapist can be rather difficult at times.
10h77ij,,j5cht3b,Idk. From my own experience going through that i dont think time to heal from that trauma is good. Being on the streets is traumatic which is exactly why i got to work. I know what its like out there and never want to go back. He never knows when he might get kicked out. OP said he was staying rn, that dint mean its going to last forever. If he not working his parents may get sick of it. They let him stay but not trying to do anything so they may say hey time to go. Its always a possibly si best to have a head start in case that happens. Then he back out there with nothing. You are right jobs arentva solution and dont pay enough but at least he has some money. Of back on streets he could have money for food, on really bsd weather days can spring for a room and stuff like that.  Also correct dont come in hot. Express your concern and just mention the things i just said as reason why you concerned. He may not of thought of those things and may realize thstd right. You cant get him to do anything. Just tell him you are concerend and why and its in his hands.
10h77ij,,j5f5tdn,I could not disagree with this more strongly. Trauma is not a good thing. Even where it serves as a motivating factor, it will often do far more damage than whatever gain can be had through that motivation. And that's just for those who find it motivating. A very large portion of the population are going to experience the opposite effect from trauma. For many, it can be paralyzing. For others, it can inhibit their ability to effectively do what they're trying to do.  Taking this kind of approach to trauma is a recipe for disaster. And it has probably caused you far more problems than you are willing to admit. I would suggest taking some time to pause and reflect, and take care of the plank in your own eye before you try to get the speck out of someone else's. It does not sound like what you're saying is coming from a place of good mental and emotional health.
10h77ij,,j5g2e6u,Im anctially doing gereat. Once i got secure with my finances and had back up to relax a little i started dealing with my stuff and couldnt be happier. Im not saying ti just ignore it im saying get stable and then deal with it so theres less to worry about. But dealing with ylur trauma before your problems are solved will only lead to backslides.
10h77ij,,j5g2vtp,But the trauma IS one of the problems, and it can go a long way to preventing someone's situation from being stable. I'm very happy that you're happy with your life, but that just isn't how trauma works for the majority of people. It can outright keep someone from functioning. There's nothing stable about that situation at all.
10h77ij,,j5g5kjy,I know it had me paralized a very long time which is why i couldnt get stable. But i found enogh fight in me to do what i had to so outside forces couldnt control my life. I had to take care of myself becuase i had nobodh to even turn yo for anything let alone help. I know it wirks different for everyone i was simply giving advice based off what worked for me. Everyone here gives opinions and options so the person can look thru and chose themselves. It was simply another thing for them to consider. I never intended it to be ab Bsolute. The more options presented the more they can consider. We dont know the whole situation so they can pick what closest pertains to them
10h77ij,,j5g6suy,Part of healing from trauma IS being able to cultivate the fight to do what you have to do. That's kind of what I'm talking about. Everybody's makeup is different, but the core idea of dealing with that trauma is there regardless.
10h77ij,,j58mtq2,I think professional help should be considered, have you reached out to any social workers?  (If not, just know that they‚Äôre all wayyy over loaded. It‚Äôll likely take time.)  There‚Äôs just a lot involved and it‚Äôs helpful to have someone educated and skilled in social work to comb through the situation.
10h77ij,,j57fdnh,I'm guessing you're upper-middle class.. since you think furniture is expensive. Pawn shops sell entire used bedroom or livingroom sets for $90. Craigslist is littered with decent furniture people are giving away.  Nobody loses sleep over furniture.
10h77ij,,j57grtu,...what are you talking about? Where did furniture come into this? That seems to be a pretty small part of the equation. And besides, for people living under the poverty line, $90 is expensive af.
10h77ij,,j57psm0,I didn't say that furniture was expensive. But since we're on the subject it is expensive for people just now coming up in the financial game. Imagine getting a place and not being able to afford furniture so you have to wait for your check to come it to buy it? Having money saved will at least cushion the blow and you could use it for something else like bills or a gaming console to destress after a hard days of work.
10h77ij,,j5b2aze,OK‚Ä¶ so save 200 bucks for a rainy day.
10h77ij,,j590glf,so you sleep on the floor or sit on a milk crate , you make do until you get $ for  furniture
10h77ij,,j5b4kkf,Which is exactly why it only makes sense for him to start working now so that he can have a bed.
10h77ij,,j5dj3p9,Exactly, start looking for jobs NOW
10h77ij,j571pgv,,That's nice of her.  Just strongly advise her not to cosign a lease for him.
10h77ij,,j589s79,OMG, this!
10h77ij,j573u3g,,If he's at his parents, he can get a job before she spends her money on an apartment. So he will at least have a chance of keeping  it. Is she going to be on the hook for the entire term of the lease??????
10h77ij,,j57npcw,that's what I fear. I doubt that she'll just allow him to mooch off her like that, but onething I do know is that she's a giver and would help people at her own expense sometimes. Honestly I don't think that she should be paying for his place unless he's committed to getting money and paying her back/supporting himself. Its part of being a grown man to be able to support yourself when you have the opportunity.
10h77ij,,j57saya,Since he's housed at his parents why is she set to pay for an apartment?
10h77ij,,j5b4ssv,his parents are toxic and meth addicts. Idk if they stopped using it or not.
10h77ij,j57evjt,,Might be a good idea to look into disability resources in your area that he might qualify for. As the other commenter was mentioning, homelessness comes with a lot of trauma, and getting/keeping a job can be much easier said than done.
10h77ij,,j57o6gt,yeah, that's true. I was homeless twice before meeting him. A lot of it had to do with resistance towards work like. "Its going to take a long time to earn money." Or I'm too good to work because I'm an artist/tarot reader so I should be getting paid for that. It wasn't until I realized that if I wanted to be happy (outside of my spiritual practices) then I need to find a way to get money. Even if that means working. I just couldn't afford to be homeless and allow my talents to go to waste. Maybe I just need to find a way to inspire him?
10h77ij,,j58r4ic,He probably doesn't feel ready to get a job, and has a lot of anxiety associated with work, but otherwise would like to find himself in a hypothetical situation where he's comfortable in his job and income, something he might not expect to happen based on past experiences.   Whether that conclusion is reasonable or not, it could be where the hesitation comes from. I don't know this person at all so I can only really project here.
10h77ij,,j590lrg,well as long as he is stayin at his parents or having some gf set him up in an apartment i guess he figures why work
10h77ij,,j5ap3fl,One thing you cannot expect is that his experience mirrors your own. So, his experience of homelessness and trauma is not the same as yours. His resources are not the same as yours were when you were homeless. So it's not really fair for you to set expectations for him.
10h77ij,,j5b679t,That's definitely true. That's why I haven't been on his ass about it or making a big deal out of it because I'm sure that he's dealing with stuff that I'm not. I just want him to elevate because I know that the longer he goes without making money then the harder it's going to be. I like to consider myself someone who's going to be successful and high value so I would like for him to be successful so that he can live a good life.   But it's not for me to decide whats best for him so I would only suggest things then leave it at that if he doesn't want to listen or follow through.
10h77ij,j57u1x0,,How is he intending to pay the rent for this apartment? I agree with you, this seems like a cart before the horse kind of thing.
10h77ij,j57m5hh,,funny how you think job=escaped poverty üòÜ
10h77ij,,j57my43,Better to have a job with some money in your pocket than to not have one and have to depend on others to get it. Yeah jobs don't pay as much as you want them to, but it's at least enough to get momentum going in the right direction.
10h77ij,,j590onb,well stated my friend
10h77ij,,j5djcft,Don't bother, these people rather be live check to check working minimum wage jobs than to just give up 2 years and work non stop grinding to better yourself.
10h77ij,j57sxz9,,It's my firm belief that we're not on planet Earth to "get jobs", despite what you'll hear from Washington to Beijing to Oslo to Buenos Aires. From that point of view, I almost never preach "jobbing" to anybody except those that told me they want/need jobs, and usually my pitch is like "you're not getting any younger, and the gap is widening, better get a job now that you've been unemployed 6 months, rather than look for one next year when you might have been out of touch with reality for 2 years".  So, if not job then what: dream, vision, center! Get in touch with your friend's core, find out if it's broken or inactive, nourish it if you can. With humans anything goes, sometimes the simplest quirk or inaction is camouflaging years of pain and abuse. Or sometimes it's like Snoop, too much Chronic

10h77ij,,j57obfi,enjoying the show? Feel free to engage in conversation with me and the other commentary friend. üòá
10h77ij,j56y53e,,You and your friend just cut this useless waste of air out of your lives. He's not worthy of helping and he's prolly one of those proud to be bum types. God these freaks annoy the fk outta me. Fk'em.
10h77ij,,j5arqb5,You are absolutely wrong about this human being.  Trauma doesn't erase the thing in you that is sacred. There is something in all of us that is good, and that is worth preserving. The trauma we accrue in our lives is just extra baggage.   Given a different set of circumstances, almost all of us would thrive. If you've never been through the experience, then you simply do not yet apprehend the trauma of this person's life.  If you went through a storm of trauma, and it caused you to be homeless, and I said the same thing about you, I would be wrong also.
10h77ij,,j5bbeym,What trauma? I totally get the PTSD, depression or whatever, but judging by the OP's post there aren't indicatives that the person in question has any kind of trauma issues, but it seems that he's just lazy and careless.
10h77ij,,j5bcn12,Don't pretend that you know. All you have is a paragraph or two on Reddit.  If you had the whole story and it's entirety, the chances are that you would be far more compassionate towards them.  The fact that you can use the words "what trauma" indicates that you do not know what you are talking about. You're not even on Square One.   Go work in a shelter for a year, or as a social worker with any organization that assists homeless people.
10h77ij,,j5be1xi,>If you had the whole story and it's entirety, the chances are that you would be far more compassionate towards them.  I'm not pretending, i don't know, neither do you i assume, and yeah if i had the whole story i would be more compassionate. I also assume if he had mental health issues the OP would have mentioned IG. You can't deny, that there are homeless ppl who don't have any trauma but are just lazy bums.
10h77ij,,j5bfdn6,I can absolutely deny that shit, having worked for a homeless shelter for six and a half years. I know the names of people that are experiencing homelessness right fucking now.  They all have trauma. If you don't think so, then you are in the dark on this matter. Inexperienced, and ignorant. That doesn't mean that you are worthless, but in this particular conversation your opinion doesn't mean much.  Try having some conversations with these people, and really listening to their narratives. Talk to and listen to them instead of kicking them while they're down. It doesn't serve you or anyone to speak this way about human beings who have just as much potential to heal and thrive as you or I do.  It is mythic propaganda from people who have never experienced homelessness that insists otherwise, and you bought the lie for whatever reason.   The word "bum" is also false propaganda. If you want to stop spreading lies, then stop using it.
10h77ij,,j5bqqmi,k
10h77ij,,j577860,Why am i getting downvoted for, that ain't fair!? The guy is clearly a POS parasite, a useless eater, who wants to exploit others cos he's lazy and now I'm getting downvoted for being real! If he couldn't work due to mental or physical disability it'd be another story ,but that isn't mentioned in the post, so one has a right to assume that he's just a lazy leech. Like vagabonds.
10h77ij,,j57mtdh,Take a deep breath my dude
10h77ij,,j57s31d,Happy cake day!
10h77ij,j57yyd9,,The employment situation should be resolved ahead of renting the apartment. The problems are being solved in the wrong order
10h77ij,j585u73,,For the most part, people are where they want to be. But good luck.
10h77ij,j58aalk,,There are a lot of things about his situation that we don't know and that you might not know either. A lot of homeless people are dealing with mental illness, disability, and addiction. Although it's entirely possible your friend could just be down on his luck and willing to improve as soon as he gets the chance.  Not everyone is willing to tell all the personal details or admit to problems they're facing. I've worked with people of all different backgrounds, hardships, disabilities, addiction... Outside of healthcare and social work I think the best thing anyone can do is to provide support. Let him know you'll help however you can.  One day he might ask for help moving his things in, a ride to the food bank, etc. When he feels safe he might even ask you to be a job reference.
10h77ij,j5a6bk1,,Never ever give anything as a gift. Tell him and make sure he knows, that you expect it back in the near future. If he doesn‚Äôt pay it back, then cut him off. You are NOT a bank, and he is NOT your child. This may seem rude, but it is not your fault he is unemployed and couch surfing. He is an adult and it is time for him to start acting like it.
10h77ij,j5auxk5,,He wants to be homeless. It‚Äôs a real thing. Better she get him a minivan or van and teach him to do door dash than an apartment. That way it‚Äôs the best of both worlds.
10h77ij,j5aw7qr,,My first thought, is that you cannot convince anyone who has been through a traumatic experience to work. The most likely thing to happen would be that they would lose their job.  Why? Because the trauma has not yet been addressed. To address trauma, you need safe space that can be transformed into healing space. People need to sleep behind a locked door, often for months, before their mind is able to wrap itself around the traumatic events that led to homelessness.  All of us have the elasticity in our minds that is necessary to sort out trauma. But not all of us have the safe space in which to do so.  I've been case managing people who have experienced homelessness for 8 years. There is no healing on the street. Some of my clients get jobs right away, some of them have to heal for a few months, some of them over a year, and some of them never heal enough to be able to hold down a job.   If this guy is young, it is likely that he does not have decades of compounded trauma associated with homelessness. It is likely that he will be able to heal relatively quickly, and find employment.  But no matter what that timeline looks like, it is a mistake for you to attempt to dictate what it looks like. It is a mistake for you to use the word "mooch" at all.  What you can do is care for them. Try to alleviate their suffering. Try to rally the community that he has around him, and maybe even recruit a few people from your own community around him.   If your friend is willing to put up the first month's rent for this person experiencing homelessness, she is doing something that is immensely personal and humanizing, and rare. Perhaps you can take inspiration from her and provide the last month's rent. Or perhaps you know someone who can pool resources with you to do so.  Helping somebody heal is a holistic process. It cannot be half-assed with congregate shelters and imaginary expectations. Cities half-ass it all the time, and check out their results.  You either care for this person, or you don't. If you do, then help your friend that is helping him. If you don't, then step out of the way.  There is a very real danger that your actions in this matter will simply increase his trauma. Especially with the approach described in the op.
10h77ij,,j5b4bpp,I'm trying my best to help out the situation without pressuring him. Yeah, I know that the ball is in his court to make the get the ball rolling for his future, but I didn't think that his trauma could be the thing stopping him currently.  I will not make a deposit on his rent because I still need to get a place myself so that I can work on my long term goals. I don't want to enable him, but if he got a job or had a legal way for himself to make money then I would be willing to put money down. Maybe it's trauma maybe it's complacency. Either way the reality is that if he doesn't have money then he's not going to get anywhere.
10h77ij,,j5b4mha,If you need a place yourself, then you should not be involved at all in his situation. You've got enough on your plate.  I will repeat, the chances that you are going to simply increase his trauma (and thereby affect his future) right now are tremendous.
10h77ij,,j5bkf5n,I try my best to respect his boundaries while offering helpful advice. For example the other day we asked past my job because he was looking for an apartment. Later that day we met and I told him that it would be cool to work together with him and if he ever wants to meet my coworkers or work with me I'd get him an application. I told him that it'll be a good way for him to have start off money for furniture. He acknowledged it. But didn't continue the conversation so I didn't pressure him or nag him for a definite answer.
10h77ij,,j5b5itl,Also, this idea of "complacency" amongst the lower socioeconomic classes it's just mythic propaganda that only serves the rich, and those caught up in a social climbing contest.   True complacency can be observed by hanging out with a billionaire's spouse. The stuff you see with people wanting to play video games, not work, sitting around the basement, etc, are not on the same level. You simply do not understand or see all of the trauma that is involved with individual history and circumstances.  All of us have an imperfect view of others.
10h50bj,j56go5a,,The usual. Chupacabras and the occasional alien. That looks like aliens to me.  What's that white stuff?
10h50bj,,j56h8tb,>That looks like aliens to me.  It's actually a bunny rabbit.  There's a bunch of them that makes it looks like each one is an entire foot, but it's just an entire rabbit print.  It's the only logical explanation I can think of.  >What's that white stuff?  Cocaine of course.
10h50bj,,j56jc8d,Nothing better than a cocaine party with rabbits.

10h50bj,,j56oe26,Ha! üòÜ
10h50bj,,j57v932,That was really funny.   Oh, and the reason rabbit prints look like that is because when they step their back paws actually end up in front of where their front paws were. So yeah, it can kinda look like the track was made by one big foot.
10h50bj,,j57wbvg,BUNNIES!  I was slightly impressed that I got to see some recently, in the middle of the city, near a little wooded patch in behind all the apartment buildings where I live.  Tracks I mean.  Haven't seen the bunnies yet. All the feet, all together.. Hop hop hop.
10h50bj,j56tj4g,,As long as they ain't the human kind I'm good.
10h50bj,j57n85p,,a red fox I took a picture of. spiders. beautfil snakes. bats. no people. oh wait, police. drive thru sometimes. they dont stop, just wave.
10h50bj,j57p0w8,,noble ok: the coolest thing i saw was on a august night it was perfect around 80 and i was walking around 3 am. i photographed this intricate spiders web omgosh it was a special find. the threading looking like glowing blue in the moonlight.
10h50bj,j56rfp1,,Once I saw 2 foot prints and 1 hoof print. A man with a cane from a taxidermist deer leg? A three legged deer with boots stuck on its feet? Who knows
10h50bj,,j56suxx,There are rabbits, raccoons, foxes, dogs, and cats that roam our camp.  They are the only wild animals I've seen.    If it's not a rabbit then I have no idea what it is.  My bear spray is always close though.
10h50bj,j57zv8z,,You‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs a bunny print
10h50bj,j58mo0t,,How do you define monsters?
10h50bj,j56hzco,,Lots of bunny and some rats...
10h50bj,j5b8rtt,,trash to pickup. i was resting at a park way out in purcell for awhile, police noticed me picking up trash and keeping the area nicer. i thot, yeah, its my environment of course im picking up trash.   im excited to have housing soon so i dont run into the creepies or the bugs for summer. snakes, spiders are pretty cool though I film those when I see them.
10h0tch,j55vzj7,,You mentioned in other posts that you're in graduate school. Does your school have any housing resources you might tap into? Or do you have a job now?
10h0tch,,j55wxja,I was not able to continue with school. When I split from the partner I was living with at the end of 2021 my only option was to move states away where I had ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. My partner and I at the time shared finances, and when I wasn‚Äôt working and was struggling I thought grad school would show him and everybody else that I was trying and motivated while I was trying to figure out why my mental health was so bad and I couldn‚Äôt keep a job. When I had to leave that relationship I couldn‚Äôt afford my books and stuff anymore, I got behind on school during the moving process, at one point I didn‚Äôt have my laptop because my luggage was lost by fault of United. I got everything back but by that point they had revoked my financial aid due to attendance and I now owe them thousands of dollars I don‚Äôt have for my online program. And ontop of that the program I‚Äôm in isn‚Äôt even credited in this state apparently. I guess education is vastly different from state to state, I didn‚Äôt realize that would affect my school counseling program. It‚Äôs all been worst case scenario stuff for the last few years leading up to this point.
10h0tch,j55rw89,,Theres not a lot of good news here and you pretty much summed it up yourself. It's the middle of the Winter so every shelter is going to be full.  If you have friends to stay with, just stay there and don't get kicked out.  A good plan b would be to head south.  But it still gets cold at night.  It's the worst time of the year to be homeless.  My advice would be to stay indoors for a few more months.
10h0tch,,j55sdys,The only urgency I have to getting out is wondering how much more petty and hostile the environment would get. I‚Äôm anxious everytime someone comes home from work they‚Äôre gonna try to force me out. My roommate has not spoken to me and I‚Äôve been blocked on Facebook. I‚Äôve kept my head down for months, let people take things and use me just to keep them happy so I could stay there. I finally told someone no on something yesterday and here we are. Damn me for wanting some form of autonomy when you‚Äôve been set up to completely rely on other people who end up not being trustworthy at all.
10h0tch,,j55we0x,Sounds better than being outdoors.
10h0tch,,j55xjk6,I‚Äôm not trying to suggest I‚Äôm not lucky. I know I‚Äôm not currently outside. I‚Äôm hoping I won‚Äôt be. This post was simply to state my situation and say my fears. They can change their minds I can‚Äôt control other peoples behavior regardless of whose ass I kiss. And I have really bad anxiety due to PTSD. Those things make being inside incredibly difficult as well. I would really appreciate that while I‚Äôm highly stressed people reply with empathy
10h0tch,j565ox1,,I feel this. We may not be in the same boat but we're both floating down the same shit creek. I got accepted for a job but probably won't get it due to not having transportation to the training site. If I can some how figure that out I still need a place to stay while I work. My plan is to save up money for a van that way I can always have my own space and transportation. It doesn't seem possible but everyday I try to do everything I can to make it happen. Not sure what I'll do if it all falls apart but I'm not sure of much nowadays anyways. I hope you the best and feel free to reach out if you ever need to talk with some on common ground.
10h0tch,,j565xv3,Thank you. I‚Äôve been hyper vigilant for two days, gonna try to rest while I can. I‚Äôll read everyone‚Äôs support later. Thanks.
10h0tch,j5db30e,,Do you have any education to lean on - school, a trade etc.? I do better when I focus on one or two things I am ok at
10h0tch,,j5e7h68,I had that before I had to deal with ptsd all the time. I got so sick from it last year I lost 70 pounds
10h0tch,,j5fqc15,I read your entire post and I couldn't agree more. Our country has no support for people who get a little behind. It's going to get alot worse.
10h0tch,j5g1g92,,You made all the calls, you've either been turned down, or discontinued from whatever support there is.  You have no safety net that you can see, and it is a long way down.  What cash can you come up with?  Flying a sign, calling people you've called before for one final request for anything.... $10 even.. selling any belongings that can add dollar bills to the pile.    Somewhere near you... and by "near" I mean in the same town, county, or district, there is a vehicle to be had.  It is going to be cheap, and it will run.  It might be down to only having one brake operating... or it might be missing a shock absorber (I've purchased both)... but it will run and it will be dirt cheap.  It will get you to a place where the weather will not kill you, or it will get you closer to one at any rate.  It will provide you with shelter that you can turn into a home on wheels, regardless of the size and your budget.  Old clothes stuffed into the footwells of the rear passenger section, can level out that seat to be a much wider bed.  You don't need to purchase some inflatable mattress to do the same.  You can even be neat, and keep folded clothes in nylon bags, and use THOSE to fill the footwells and the widening of the base of your "bed".  Or pillow cases instead of bags.  Like... sandbags, except that's where you keep your clothes.  When it isn't a bed, you break the bags out to get at the clothes.  That is just looking at one person can do with a couple hundred dollars (It was $300 for the van with no brakes, and $400 for the truck with three shocks).  Now... I \*do\* actually know how insurmountable even a couple hundred dollars can seem.  This is why, if you really do feel you are at the end of your rope, you should consider letting go of anything you've held on to, if it can get you to the goal of purchasing some shit-box of a car.  This is why you consider talking to people you tapped out years ago, for one final donation.  Tell them what it is for.  Tell them why... because it will keep you off the streets, and it will help you find the place where you \*can\* get a foothold.  It doesn't matter if you have a license.  I know.... I know.  I'm not trying to tell you to become a criminal.  Today, if you are mobile... you \*do\* have a greater chance of being told to "find a place to park it and don't drive", as opposed to them actually towing the vehicle.  Especially, if this is the first time they are seeing/stopping you.... and you aren't currently a notation on their paperwork already.  Which means if you are going from point A to point B... and point B is a new town or state where there are resources available for you in your situation, getting stopped by a local or state cop WILL most likely result in them letting you go.  This of course, does vary per state.... in Washington State, a supreme court ruling in 2018 on the state's Homesteading Act essentially ruled that a vehicle with Washington plates is a home, and thus cannot be taken away from someone who lives in it.  Even if the person living in it doesn't OWN the vehicle, as was the case \*in\* the legal case which sparked this decision.  A guy in Seattle, living in a friend's broken down truck, got the truck towed.  It was parked outside of the allowed industrial area there where overnight parking is allowed.  He got the truck back, no legal or impound fines.  Now, streets in Olympia look like RV parks.  The point is... get mobile, and get moving.  It is far easier to "Go Jugging" at a strange gas station, begging a gallon at a time and occasionally meeting people who fill your tank, than it is to remain landlocked into a location that you already know has nothing for you.  It would be cheaper to get a bus ticket somewhere... but that implies knowing a destination beforehand.  You need shelter now, and a vehicle will provide that shelter.  By and large it will provide the most resistance to the elements, while being durable enough to withstand the most punishing of weather.  And the point is to get you out of where you are, and somewhere that is friendlier to you in the immediate.  And... if you are looking at living outside right now as your only option... your immediate landscape is finding better weather.  That requires mobility.  You can walk.  You can bike.  You can hitch (not recommended), you can hop (not recommended)... you can drive (eh... yeah, I'm recommending it)... you can bus or train, but that's a single expensive push, that still leaves you exposed to the weather for some duration in the new setting.  By using a vehicle, you at least have that shell as shelter in the new town/city/state.  UNTIL you can make use of whatever local resources are available there.  Think of it this way... $400 can get you a bus ticket and a short stay at a cheap motel, or it could get you a vehicle that takes you there and houses you until you get into a shelter or better housing situation.  And potentially get you out of there if things don't work out, and to another place entirely.  Where do you find these vehicles?  Start with welding shops, boiler shops, industrial areas... anywhere that manufactures and delivers locally whatever services they provide.  For example, a boiler shop bought three HVAC vans at an auction (the HVAC company had gone out of business).  They bought them for the parts on the shelves inside of the vans (fittings, pipes, hoses).  Once they emptied the vans (since the parts were worth far more than what they paid for the vans), they stored them out behind their shop.  Two of the vans still ran.  One ran well enough to drive down the east coast, from New England to Florida, back to New England, and back down to North Carolina.  For $300.  It might be a bakery that has their own delivery vans, and they've got one out behind their store that isn't being used anymore.  Or like the printing company in Tallahassee that had a van they weren't using, because there were entry and exit bullet holes in the windshield (entry) and about a foot behind the driver's head in the left side of the van (exit).  No one was in the van when it was shot.  Or the short bus at the bus maintenance garage in Aberdeen, WA, that wasn't being used because of superficial damage to the rear quarter that wasn't cost effective to repair.    It will require leg work to find these... because you are looking for something that some business doesn't care about selling, which is why it will be so cheap, and sitting on some property unused.  But this is a common "thing" among smaller businesses of these types.  Vehicles get retired and written off that are still usable, and you taking it off their hands saves them the trouble of transporting it to scrap for the $250.  Which brings up another place to beg for a car... Pick n Pull lots, auto-graveyards, car junk yards.  Often, they will get cars that still run, and they paid $200-$250 for them... or they got paid to tow them away.  They can also be a source of cheap cars that will give you $500 worth of performance, likely more.  And... when you get a foothold where you end up, you can junk it for that same $200-$250 as seed money.  ...  If you already have a car.  Get into it.  Dump what won't fit, with you living in it.  Get somewhere with better weather.  Scour the area for available resources as you already are well acquainted with doing.  Or Get into the car, and find a library.  Connect online, and search nearby states for what resources are available... you can look up local PIT counts for how many homeless shelter beds are available versus the number of homeless in that city/town/county.  Find a place with high bed counts, or low numbers of homeless closer to the number of available beds, and there will be shorter wait times to get into shelters, and likely other programs like transitional housing to keep the local numbers down.  Just remember, you are fighting against the weather as much as anything else.  Warmer climates during the winter are better than colder, when homeless.

10h0tch,,j5dusna,Yeah, because depending on men has worked out well for her so far.
10h0tch,j56914o,,Hey I‚Äôm literally I feel the same way. I‚Äôm in your shoes. I‚Äôm currently trying to make my way back out to guam. But the flights are 1,560. Tbh it‚Äôs better being homeless there idk. But. Where are you?

10h0tch,j5c062i,,I can relate in several ways, but I‚Äôve been struggling with unemployment for ten years. I‚Äôm also diagnosed CPTSD, and I‚Äôve been denied SSI over and over. I don‚Äôt feel like I have a future at all and most days I hope I go to sleep and never wake up. Crippling poverty has only made my situation so much worse. Mental health care in my area is horrible. I hope something works out for you. I know how hard all of this is. üò¢
10h0tch,,j5c0hk8,I feel that we may have a lot in common. I try not to talk a lot about SI even if I have it cause it can be triggering for everybody, but outside of that you can reach out at some point. I‚Äôm getting ready to crash for the night. But I‚Äôll peek later.
10h0tch,j5f5p7j,,Call 2-1-1 and see what they have for local resources. Everyone gets turned down for disability. Everyone gets turned down, so you get a lawyer who does it on contingencies that you win and get it that way. If you can push a button with your tong they say you‚Äôre abled. Also you can‚Äôt care what the worker thinks bring your worst. Most people don‚Äôt want to seem crazy, but for their shrink you want to put peanut butter in your ass crack and lick a finger in front of him.

10h0tch,,j5fg9dq,I got on disability for Cptsd. Good luck.
10h09xm,j55q5s6,,I just want to say I think that‚Äôs a great idea. In my travels I try to educate where I can, because there‚Äôs a lot of unjustified negativity directed towards us as a whole.    A central hub to communicate directly would be an amazing tool
10h09xm,,j55xebl,Thank you. I swear, so many housed people think "have you tried 211?" Is some mind blowing secret to getting help. And then the dismissive attitude from people when you try to explain how most programs don't help you specifically. Like, they think I'm making excuses and want to be homeless forever... but really I just want to stay with my pets and not give up what little I have managed to keep. Then I find helpful resources way to long after they could have helped... it's an infuriating spiral.  I already was able to pass info along (postmaster/ homeless address) that the charity wasn't aware of that will directly help someone. Those little wins give me life.
10h09xm,,j56fz15,211 helped me several times! An operator once gave me a phone number to her friend who was renting a house cheap. I was able to rent it too! They have steered me to the nearest food bank, gave lots of great info. I love 211.
10h09xm,,j57zibd,I‚Äôve noticed that the usefulness of 211 varies greatly in different states/counties. Where I am it‚Äôs terrible, it‚Äôs basically an outdated yellow pages.
10h09xm,,j56ssar,I'm not completely knocking it. It does have a positive impact in some cases but it bothers me when it's treated like the ultimate answer to poverty. I live in South Carolina which is notorious for its less than stellar treatment of the poor. So, calling 211 is usually an exercise in futility. I have called and texted in utter despairation on more than one occasion and never been told something of use. I once even got a list of numbers to call and every number routed to the same desk... that's kind of why I'm aiming for localized info.
10h09xm,,j56tof5,Arizona has more services and help than any other state I‚Äôve been to. I traveled from Arizona to to the East coast and back. My family is in California but I can‚Äôt make it there on a $20 hour job alone. It‚Äôs very easy in Phoenix.
10h09xm,j55t7p0,,Sounds like brightertomorrowmap.com
10h09xm,,j55w6nj,Thank you! I'll check it out.  Edit: on there now and, yeah! On a base level it is exactly what I was thinking minus a bit of the more involved aspects such as having specific permission for certain things. I focus on that because I've had the local sherif tell us to park at Walmart and then the city say the business owner says to gtfo. Also had the store manager say to park overnight at lowes only to have night shift request a trespass be issued the next time we showed up. I just aim to have a bit more credibility behind each resource.  This is a great site though, despite absolutely nothing being around me üòÜ
10h09xm,j580man,,I think this is a great idea! I‚Äôm not familiar with Discord at all so I can‚Äôt speak to that aspect of it, but the general concept of having a centralized hub for local information is great. I‚Äôve run into those same types of issues you‚Äôre talking about with conflicting information from different parties and not having a clear, simple way to know **what** resources are even available. Sorry I don‚Äôt really have any advice but I hope this is something you are able to make a reality, it would be very helpful.
10h09xm,,j583yb0,The startup charity group I just spoke to has a lot of the same frustrations as I have been struggling with. There's so many sites and programs that are defunct or neglected so resource list look hopeful until you waste your days calling around. I cannot tell you how many services have never acknowledged me in any way, even to say I'm ineligible. I'm sad to hear others are just as irate with the system as I am, but glad that there seems to be at least one committed group willing to listen and advocate. I think having a united voice on both sides will help to spur change.
10h09xm,j59oyxv,,I'm in California, and here you might run into a snag due to the lack of homeless people able to keep a cell phone. They steal EVERYTHING from you where I'm at, starting with electronic devices.   I think it's worse when you're a woman. Hell, homeless men will pay their buddies to steal their girl's phone just so she has no access to the world outside of their *spot*.
10h09xm,j5ba8c9,,i like this idea. i think it would help alot of pple.   i stay at reddit, IG and youtube. thats all i can manage because of age, time, wifi, data storage phone stuff, its not easy to maintain a presence online then pple worry if they dont see you around for a while. its just not easy to log on when the phone doesnt work. there is a point when a person stops checking in, stops communicating and they dont realize it until later. its a loss of language and a loss of the drive to talk or even get help.
10h09xm,j5be9tt,,leave town in the dust. you deserve better. restart elsewhere and just phone family. your idea is very good, do the discord, ask the mods to help. mods here are really good. police do help and are understanding. police ive met were helpful and compassionate. develop the discord. it could have so many helpful tabs, tabs state by state help.
10h09xm,j5bfif9,,what about homeless alliance on IG? I follow there they might want tobe involved. i love youridea!
10h09xm,j5rcs4v,,Thank you all for encouraging this idea and sending sources. Hopefully I can pull something together that works for the locals...  Keep me updated on any topics you think should be covered that most resources gloss over. I'd appreciate multiple perspectives ü•∞
10guyhv,j54yay3,,Before you hit ‚Äòthe open road‚Äô try being a homebum for a while.   Do some urban camping close to home, or stay at a local shelter to get a feel for the street people you‚Äôll be encountering.   It‚Äôs a different world out here. Not better or worse, just different.
10guyhv,,j55lurn,I was thinking the same thing
10guyhv,,j57g8nm,That's actually really good advice thank you I will try that out
10guyhv,j58ngvv,,Do not off yourself in your parents' home, that is just gauche.   Hit the road and save them the guilt.
10guyhv,,j58ydcf,yeah bro that is low of the low.  dont be a bitch
10guyhv,,j58z0rg,I would never do that, when I attempted I did it in my apartment and that's when I moved back into my parents
10guyhv,j57ym3e,,Not going to lecture or try to dissuade you, I just want to say be careful. What I mean by that is be  cautious, don‚Äôt put yourself in unsafe situations, get a free or cheap cell phone and maintain contact with someone in your family or a trusted friend.   As for making money, what kinds of work have you done previously? What do you know how to do or are good at?   Bigger questions: what are your goals in life? If you picture yourself living a life you enjoy, what does it look like?
10guyhv,,j58zppn,Appreciate the concern, I always think 3 steps ahead before making decisions so I will try to be as safe as possible, I'm good at alot of things general labor, was a barber/ hair stylist. And as far as life goals I've lost all hope. My insomnia keeps me up for days and so I haven't been able to hold down a job so I haven't been able to be on my own for a long time so I don't even look for a companion in life because I don't deserve one. And as far as what I like to do is nothing anymore I've been depressed for 3 years straight now. I don't remember the last time I had a glimpse of happiness and I just want to stop being a burden on my parents I can see that I'm taking a toll on them and they need happiness in their life so I just need to go and be free of the weight of society.
10guyhv,,j5b37c7,If your parents need happiness, are you certain that you're departure will provide them with that?  Instead of hoisting guilt on you, it is just as likely that their personal guilt will increase. And their health will then reflect that.  Leaving might make you feel free from the burdens of society and social interaction, but the trauma associated with homelessness will accrue in a way that you cannot predict or control.  Some people experience enough trauma within just a few months of homelessness that will affect them for the rest of their lives. There is a very real chance that homelessness will compound the issues that you already have into an incapacity that is beyond what you have already experienced.  Perhaps there is another way to make things work at home. I would certainly never tell you what to do, but oftentimes there are unforeseen consequences to the decisions that we make.
10guyhv,,j5gqlf9,I really appreciate you're perspective on things it gives me alot to think about, I've left home multiple times from living on couches to living alone in a van and whenever I keep in contact with them they seem to be doing alot better, you can hear it in my mom's voice and she tells me how her marriage gets better, she doesn't say it's because of me moving out but it happens every time I leave home because I know that I'm a grown man when I live at home it does take a toll on them. Plus I want to do this I want to get out of my bed and explore the world and I want to get the weight of societal pressures off my shoulders. Everyone has a life that makes them happy and I feel like giving up the goals my parents have for me and doing what I think will make me happy is something I've been wanting to do for years it's just were so brainwashed from an early age to grow up get good grades, go to college, get a career, make a family and get a house and those have never interested me.
10guyhv,j55xs5s,,Have you tried counseling or medication for your depression? I was diagnosed with major depression in the 1990s and, except for a couple of years when I was without insurance and couldn't afford treatment, have been able to function well enough to work and live on my own. I know treatment isn't for everyone, but you might give it a shot. Doctors at free or low-cost clinics can prescribe antidepressants. Free counseling may be harder to find.
10guyhv,,j57hrvt,I've been to over 50 counselors and been on every anti depressant anti anxiety you can think of they don't work
10guyhv,,j581m4a,Understand that your depression is likely to get worse when you're homeless. Staying close to home is a really good idea until you can adjust to nomad life.  Have you applied for disability? If your depression is so bad that you can't keep a job, you probably qualify. (I'm assuming you're in the US.) It's not much, but it will help. Sorry, I'm not sure how to start the process, but someone else in this forum probably does.
10guyhv,,j590p0o,I lived out of a van for 2 years and it was the happiest I ever was. Being a nomad makes me happy and i really thrive i just havent done it without a vehicle, I haven't applied for disability, I heard it's almost impossible to get but I will look into it more
10guyhv,j58xl5p,,bruh.  get fuckin help.  you have something to offer this world.  you havent figured out your WHY yet.  what is your WHY?  WHY are you here?  What exactly is that thing you are here to do?  we are all here for our own reasons.  i was down and out homie....treatment etc.  i needed to figure out my why.  for a while -- i couldnt get up and live for myself cause i didnt give a fuck if i died that minute.  i needed to find a "why" in others i loved and started doing it for them, then along the way i fell upon my "why" and it has given me purpose in this world.  it gives me a reason to get up each day and look out for me.  yourself deserves the best version of yourself.  social constructs, relationships, depression -- they are all social constructs in themselves my boy -- fuck all that shit.  you have been socially conditioned to think you need to fit some type of mold -- think outside the box bro do not limit yourself.  learn to love you my man and learn to supplement that person and nurture that person who you love -- that is you.  find your why + plus learning to love yourself = finding a reason to live.
10guyhv,,j590dwy,Bro what do you think I'm doing right now, you're jumping to conclusions and making assumptions and I didn't ask for that I explained that I have tried every route to getting to a better place but after 10 years of trying and failing I have come to the conclusion to hitting the road and was asking for advice for the road so WHY are you on here being aggressive and not helping at all
10guyhv,,j590w6z,sorry bro i dont wanna come off as aggressive.  it just sounds like your ready to give up man and fuck that shit.  but if your hitting the road first off you wanna get an EBT card.  you can buy $5 cold pizzas at 711 and then have them cook it right there for you all on EBT.  Next thing i would do is try and secure a car for $500-$1000.  this you can use to sleep in etc.  store all your clothes etc.  next, i would post up near a planet fitness.  first you gotta get a planet fitness membership which is $10 a month.  posting up near a planet fitness you can use this gym to shower whenever you wanna shower and shit and get cleaned up.  other then that dude i would maybe look into building a home in the woods maybe somewhere inbetween the car and the planet fitness and maybe a 711 lol.  in the woods if i were you i would have a fuck ton of peanut butter and i would build a home with fuckin cellophane.  have you ever seen how you can take a like industrial role of cellophane and just wrap that bitch around a tall structure you build with logs or branches or some shit.  its doable.  i have a lot more ideas too homie if you need em
10guyhv,,j591tau,I gave up a few months ago and was lucky a friend found me and seeing what it did to my loved ones I could never do it again but I know I cannot live a normal life. Where would I begin to sign up for ebt I already have medicaid and a 2 year membership to 24 hour fitness so I got that part covered, I don't think I want a car, gas is too expensive and if I don't keep moving and traveling I know I'll get depressed.
10goae8,j548a1f,,I used to dumpster dive donut places, they throw donuts away every day usually.   711 throws out plastic wrapped subs, you're gonna get dirty digging through a dumpster but i did it and it kept me alive for 7 years.   Food banks sometimes have bread and stuff in the lobby you can just take.   Soup kitchens, shelters, salvation army, churches, food not bombs and the like usually have food.   People will sometimes give you their restaurant leftovers if you ask nicely and tell them you're homeless and hungry.   I used to fly a sign, busk or panhandle to get money for food.   I used to sell weed too occasionally but you kinda need to know people to do that and you risk jail.   Selling drugs? Hmm, it's illegal but so too should be creating a society that will let people starve to death. Do at your own risk!   I've had luck asking chinese restaurants at the back door if they can spare anything at all to eat.   Grocery stores throw a lot of food away but dumpster diving is kinda an art, I'd go into a store and pose as a customer and find a worker and mention something about expiry dates casually and start a conversation about how wasteful it is to throw food away and act like I'm curious and ask what days they throw the expired food away.  Usually younger workers are more receptive and talkative in my experience, less likely to be suspicious and jaded/bitter.   You have be super casual about it as though you aren't desperate you're just a clueless curious shopper interested in the workings of a grocery stores operation.   If you live in a warm climate where fruit trees grow sometimes you can find berry bushes or crab apple trees in back yards and alleys.   It's a full time job trying to fill your belly when homeless man, good luck hope this helps.   Ask me anything you want i was homeless for 7 years.üòä  Edited: to remove the calling into a fast food place.
10goae8,,j551qfk,[deleted]
10goae8,,j5783om,Yeah i suppose you're right, I'll edit my suggestions.
10goae8,,j57cnct,You can also sometimes go behind fast food places like kfc and find big bags of cooked chicken 711 throws fried chicken away too.
10goae8,,j570as7,Great list... but I do have to wonder if posts like OP are trolling us. For starters, how likely are you to be broke at the exact time you're going homeless. For me personally very unlikely, it's more likely I have $1000 in my pocket that's not enough to secure a rental. Sure, a battered housewife or teen might get in this kind of trouble, but there's relatively a lot of help for these categories.  Then you have the food question. When I gave part of my first salary to a beggar decades ago, I genuinely wouldn't know where to look for free food, except for churches. But today, with a small or big army of homeless, refugees and charities doing both street and shelter work, what's the likelihood I've seen none/little of that while in Chicago?  By the way, I don't know how universal this is, but "low key begging", I mean just being centrally and obviously in trouble, does get people to leave you some cash or at least some food. And I've seen a few conscientious citizens leave surplus food strategically placed where people in need might find them, around train stations and bus stops for example. It's very hit and miss but probably enough to stay alive! A "career homeless" should probably get a dog for 10x the charity!
10goae8,,j57b5b8,Yeah i got kicked outta my house when i was 17 and i didn't know what to do or how to survive so i found other kids like me and hung around with them and they showed me some of this stuff but some of it i figured out on my own, i guess op could be trollinh but what is the purpose behind the trolling? I just wrote down how i survived when i was homeless. Cause what if he really is homeless and doesn't know what to do? He can benefit from my experience.
10goae8,,j57j1ed,Sure, we appreciate and learn from your comments
10goae8,,j58hsx4,Nothing wrong with begging, buddhist monks have been doing it forever.
10goae8,,j57ug7p,Why did you have to survive like that for 7 years?
10goae8,,j58iwzb,Um i guess, well i don't know i just hitch hiked around Canada for 7 years, I'd stay in one city for awhile, make some friends, have some fun and then move on, i didn't have any I'd or a vehicle and my family hated me so i just lived like that, i honestly enjoyed the freedom and the challenge of surviving, which probably seems strange, i guess i wanted to experience life my way and not just be another slave working a job they hate so that some rich asshole can get even more money they'll never have enough time to spend.
10goae8,,j587v7u,Great list.
10goae8,j53y7sh,,Can you get EBT (food stamps)? Are there any food banks near you? Also call churches and shelters, some of them do lunch and/or dinner for anyone. Do you have any Little Caesar‚Äôs Pizza places nearby? They often have leftover pizzas at the end of the night that they toss, they might give them to you or set them out for you. I know it‚Äôs not anyone‚Äôs favorite thing to do but hanging out in front of a fast food place and asking people has always gotten me a meal. If none of those work out it is usually quite easy to discreetly steal from a grocery store. Good luck.
10goae8,j53ytqb,,Thursday nights at the Chicago blue line forest park stop they have soup and also other social services. Look up Night Ministry. Also, Souper Heroes has soup at other el stops on other days/nights but I don‚Äôt know which ones/which stops off the top of my head. Both have websites. I hope that helps.
10goae8,j53y2xv,,There's soup kitchens in the Chicago suburbs. There's food pantries where you can get food too. Just Google local soup kitchens. Good luck.
10goae8,j5553e8,,Dumpster diving, asking for handouts, theft (if you are good enough, do at own risk).   All have worked for me. Don‚Äôt eat dumpster meat. Dumpster bread and veg is usually fine, if you can was off produce then even better.   If possible, get a McJob. They hire most anyone and you can eat there AND be warm.
10goae8,j56buy5,,Hey, are you in the US? Call and see if you can get emergency EBT if you are. They gave it to me within the first 48 hours I believe. Make sure you tell them you're homeless.  Also see if there are shelters or food banks or a library or any kind of outreach thing in your area that can help you fill out the paperwork for an EBT card. Just having someone there while you fill in all the little boxes and cross your t's and dot your i's really makes a difference. Things are just more exhausting and overwhelming when you're homeless and paperwork sucks even on a good day.  Edit: scrolled thru the thread and saw you live in Chicago? Here is the page on emergency ebt for Illinois [((link))](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=31767)
10goae8,j54pite,,I highly recommend finding your local Food Not Bombs, I got food from them when I was homeless. Some chapters do hot meals. Tried finding one in Chicago for you. [https://fnbhp.org/](https://fnbhp.org/) Hope this helps.

10goae8,,j544ren,PADS may be of service to you what suburb are you in ?
10goae8,,j588vo9,Illinois is so good about rapidly getting people food stamps. Apply online right now if you‚Äôre able (I was called the next day when I first moved to IL from MI as a very low income disabled person who did have housing and they had me food stamps in days basically). Though I guess you have the issue of needing an address for them to mail the EBT card to. I‚Äôm in a different state at the moment but know when I applied for benefits here I was able to mark myself as homeless and use another address so if you have a friend or someone‚Äôs address you can use. Or go to a Department of Human Services office in person and see if they can help.   I know shelters and such will often let you use their address or there‚Äôs something where you can have your mail held at the post office.   Basically I would try to work out some way to get EBT because IL is one of more generous states there and you could have money to buy food in a matter of days.
10goae8,,j53x21i,Damn! I wish you were closer I have a few food stamps left but you're too far
10goae8,,j53x4do,Thanks anyway I appreciate it
10goae8,,j5a82w5,Apply for EBT, if you can catch a bus I know there's soup kitchens in  and around Chicago. Food banks as well. Please do NOT dumpster dive as there are major food safety issues and concerns you may not be aware of.  Please stay safe and stay warm out there.
10goae8,,j53x7hq,No worries hopefully you can get some help and stay warm
10goae8,,j55q1hd,Not sure how this would work without a car, but Walmart allows EBT for pickup orders. It can be done without any shared info, just place the order at the Walmart nearest to OP. (Assuming they're able to get there)
10goae8,,j55rhi1,OP is out of state and very far...they would flag my card. If they were in nearby states like New Hampshire or Connecticut it would be easier
10goae8,,j55ta11,I've seen it done Florida/Colorado/Georgia/Texas. I'm not trying to pressure you to do it. Just saying it can be done for the benefit of anyone who peruses the post.
10goae8,,j55ubp4,My EBT card was flagged for using it out of state and they even asked me to verify my residency...most states don't care but Massachusetts are strict
10goae8,,j55upz6,Oh, yeah. I've heard that about Maine and I think Delaware or Vermont. Which I can understand completely.
10goae8,,j55v5jp,Yeah most New England states are strict with their laws.

10gew3w,j52d53i,,It's very limited (and the list of participating restaurants isn't updated frequently) but homeless people also qualify for California's Restaraurant Meals Program.  Fast food is expensive, so your EBT doesn't go far, but sometimes a hot meal is nice, and when that meal is a Western Bacon Cheeseburger, that's even nicer.
10gew3w,,j52j9ti,And download the apps! Some good deals, and occasional freebie.
10gew3w,,j56rtmk,There's no Japanese style 7-11s with free microwave/mini-oven for the customers so they can heat their meals at least?
10gew3w,,j579ude,Marukai/Little Tokyo Marketplace do!
10gew3w,,j579rcx,McDonald's and Del Taco accept EBT RMP and you can easily get meals for under $3 with app desls.
10gew3w,j52jhi6,,Also if you're in CA and homeless, you qualify for Medi Cal, which is pretty decent. It may not cater to your specific healthcare needs perfectly, but its access to both mental and physical healthcare.
10gew3w,j5353e9,,there are some states that make you a SNAP card same day. norman ok office can do that. not sure where else does.
10gew3w,,j5359ck,Only of you get approved for expedited in California
10gew3w,,j535cji,thats good still :)
10gew3w,,j56sck3,you wouldn't have the percentages, right? Like how many get rejected for expedited. I remember we had someone a couple of weeks back telling us about free and easy stamps/money in SF I think, but I think he was saying "without proper ID" also which I find very unlikely! Anyway, it's no secret that the homeless are not dying from hunger in the West. But they do die from cold and diseases!
10gew3w,j52mrj0,,Except in Delaware and Nevada. I was homeless last year and got stuck in Delaware then stuck in Las Vegas. Then I came back to Arizona and they hooked me up! I got food stamps and medicade the same day I applied. Got a good job and a homeless agency paid my rental deposit. It can‚Äôt get better than Arizona.
10gew3w,,j53ivy7,Sorry to ask, but do you know if you get such even with a job? Currently make $17.10 right now but live in my car, so I'm unsure if I would qualify for food stamps and such AZ wise.
10gew3w,,j53lfda,I got a job for a collection agency for $19/hr. No experience needed and employers here are desperate. I‚Äôve applied for mortgage collections and that is salary of $7k a month. They even hire very young people. I worked at the office my first couple months and now I work at home. If you can pass a background check you could get any customer service job here. There is an employee shortage. And Arizona has nice friendly people.
10gew3w,,j5560g2,Delaware sucks for helping with us. I've been homeless 3 times and twice was in Delaware. Salvation Army treated us like criminals and Hope House made us do bag checks, give up our cellphones and can only have 7 outfits. The friendship house denied me because I had a job that required me to close the store at 9:30-10pm. The only place that seemed "welcoming" enough was the Mission and that's because most of the people there have been there a long time.
10gew3w,,j55ew7m,Delaware was the worse state to be homeless in. I applied for medical care and they called me two months later after I already moved on.
10gew3w,j58adc9,,I just got rejected for it, because my last day of work this month was the 6, and the funds put me over, so now I have to wait 13 days for the real appt
10ftbmz,j4ywgt2,,Call up your local church. They have coat drives all the time and probably have something in your size. You don't have to be a Christian or anything, they'll help anyone, just call up their office, explain your situation, ask if they have hotel vouchers, coats or know of any local organization that can help

10fs9q5,j4z2gt6,,Will be 64 in February veryberryblue. Never have health problems nor colds for that matter. Luckily. I have been able to stay this way all my life.  Wasn't the case for my wife of 35 years though. Advanced breast cancer stoled her from me. It's been a struggle since she left but so far I have managed to remain in a house. I have to admit this though, the one I live in now is a dump to the one in the mountains plus costing more money.  In the reality of if I became homeless? I believe it would be hard on my health and I couldn't last at it long. That age factor would catch up with me.  Honestly, I don't know how these folks can do it. They have some kind of drive inside that keeps them going.  I know this. If things don't start improving soon, many more folks are going to be out in the streets. Its a struggle just to survive whether you have one of these slumlord shacks or homeless.  Trust me here when I say, I have to watch everything I do, as one wrong move will put me out too. Sending blessings to better days for everyone.
10fs9q5,,j4z31oz,Your story sounds very similar to mine. I lost my SO, live in a really run-down place, am very poor, about the same age as you and one wrong move could spell homelesness for me. Also, like you, because of my age I don't think I'd fare very well out there. Homelesness was a fun an exciting adventure in my teens and twenties but now, probably not so much.
10fs9q5,,j4z5t1c,I remember when life was really pretty good for us, my wife and I.   Going through that disease with my Cancer Warrior lady pretty well wiped us out financially. Then when she passed, so did her income.  I have had family say in the past, the struggle is real. I'm here to tell you from past experience, "The struggle is real!"  No, I haven't hit that homeless part. I have traveled the Cancer Warrior path. Trust me. I wish that on nobody.  Hang in there though. Never give up and keep on fighting. Stay positive and never quit! Sending blessings!
10fs9q5,j502q5k,,55 living in a van in Seattle. I'm lucky I'm in good shape. Could be worse
10fs9q5,j4z1fvt,,I've known an old guy who could only walk a little ways between COPD and mobility, he had disability/retirement income and was a veteran, rode the bus and chilled where the stuff he needed was didn't go far lived in Florida where it was warm, got by alright.   But nah, there're crippled people on the streets, in the poor areas they are from there and have communities and they rely on their community and friends for help, the types who end in the weekly motels sometimes. When you need more help, you don't go hitchhiking and shit you stay where there're people you've known for your whole life.  There's in fact a ton of old and not able bodied dudes in the shelters or streets, a lot go to shelters and aren't obviously homeless because it's obviously tough outside
10fs9q5,,j4z3ju8,That second paragraph before the last was spot-on. Yes, much better when your older to stick to an area where you have friends, family, resources rather than just hitch-hiking all over the place. This is why I think if I were to become homeless I would head back up north.
10fs9q5,j514dgp,,We have several at the shelter that I work at, I think our oldest guest is in his late 60s. Some use walkers and canes, almost all of them have several medications that need to be managed, many have diabetes. We have a few that really struggle with self-care and need to wear adult diapers - honestly they should be in a nursing home, but they refuse to go so we do our best to care for them. It's very cold where we are (Northern Wisconsin) and we have a guy right now who got caught out in it a couple weeks ago and is dealing with frostbite on all of his fingers, I helped him change his dressings this morning. He's in his late 50s and struggles with heroin. These guys are tough as nails and I don't know how they survive sometimes, I respect the hell out of them.
10fs9q5,,j53bvuv,I live in Northern Wisconsin.  The thought of being homeless scares the crap out of me.  I don't even think there are any homeless shelters in my county.
10fs9q5,,j5478pp,And it should‚Ä¶ maybe you should look into opening a shelter or talk to your county officials or United way. That would definitely benefit people.
10fs9q5,,j54990a,Any idea which county officials would be best to talk to?  Any advice would be appreciated.
10fs9q5,j51hd76,,I was homeless last summer. I‚Äôm 56. I got free medical care. Now I‚Äôm working and do not have insurance and desperately need to see a dr. I‚Äôm screwed.
10fs9q5,,j51v4tk,I applied for Medicade at the DES office and was approved on the spot. I got Covid in the homeless shelter and ended up in the ICU with kidney failure and MRSA. I‚Äôm still sick and now I can choose to pay rent or go to the dr.
10fs9q5,,j51xbr1,has your medicaid somehow expired?
10fs9q5,,j51xs8l,I‚Äôm not sure. I tried to call numerous times but cannot get a human on the line. I assumed it expired in January and missed the opportunity to apply at my job in October.
10fs9q5,,j52z9tc,You should probably apply again anyway, but you might be able/forced to go state shopping, it is not out of the question a neighbouring state is running a favourable program. Even if it's only for 6 months or a year, it's worth it. The system has some understanding of older people, all is not lost!

10fs9q5,j51zlfj,,There's tons of oldies around. Obviously after around 65 or so your next life crisis might be your last one, whether it's your kidney or the snowstorm, and there's a steady stream of homeless corpses that don't get to see average life expectancy. I haven't been homeless in my 20's, or even 30's, kinda, though my late 30's were kinda rocky, and I tell ya, if you're going to be homeless better do it in your 20's! You can jump out of homelessness at will as a youngster, all it takes is one good love affair or job affair. For many westerners their 20's is also the last time they will have good sleep quality, even under a bridge or in a wet tent. After that access to casual jobs and casual relationships gets trickier, various body systems start fading in the 30's and if you're not a corporate backstabber it will affect everything you do for fun and profit, and it only get's bleaker from there :) I'm so glad my suspension for "threats of violence" is over so I can share my positive, optimistic view of the world :)

10fs9q5,j528gym,,I used to know a few really old people when i lived on the street, Mario and Lyle were the 2 i knew best. They seemed pretty healthy? Didn't seem to have any special needs?
10fs9q5,j52mzgl,,I've been on both sides of homelessness--homeless and worked in social services. I'm in my 40s, so I don't count. But, yes, so many 50s-60s year olds. I've known people on hospice in their 60s who are homeless. One person in 50s going through chemo and homeless. Lots of older disabled veterans. It becomes less common in 70s+ I think because there are more housing programs for 70+ years old. Also unfortunately people pass away younger. But there are homeless elderly people.
10fs9q5,j5357fb,,its lethal risks for leg problems sleeping in car. then risks of plurisy set in from fall to spring. senior centers are more aware of homeless elders today.

I told him a few times already that he better get into one job and stay with it. He had benefits with the City employment. It's gone now. I can't figure out why the very young find it so hard to be pacified?  I know one thing. He better find it to stay with it. This economy is cooling off fast and it could go bad on job market.
10fpiib,,j506sbt,Switching jobs is currently the best way to get a raise. Nothing wrong with moving around and trying to find a job you might actually like.    I know, crazy concept.

10fpiib,,j517cwh,6 jobs in 2 months is too many

I've never seen someone make much in retail without yrs, factory get on a tow motor and move up, it pays well zero previous training needed often...  I when I was young served and I knew a few that got out doing that, it's stressful but you can do pretty well a lot of places...

10foey9,,j4ytq82,I do cnc machine, I had previous experience, but I got low-ball because of my background, we have tow motor operators making good money...   I'm only making a few bucks more than a tow motor operator at my shop, in the future I'll make real good money... I do work a 50 hr week though.
10foey9,j4z0iab,,CNC experience is a good trade. Learning how to make changes in a program setup and actually doing the programs is what employers look for. The more you learn, the better the pay.  Happy this is all working out great for you and wishing you a wonderful future. Blessings!

10flbvl,,j504uz2,They do it all the time, at least where I live.  The local hospital discharges people to us constantly (I work at a shelter).  Often it‚Äôs our own guests so that‚Äôs whatever, they‚Äôve been here before.  But they‚Äôll try to discharge psych patients who are not med compliant and not well enough to be in a shelter environment, and also, we are not a facility!  It‚Äôs an overnight emergency shelter - we don‚Äôt have the capabilities of handling complex physical or mental needs, and our staff end up as punching bags (literally sometimes) because they‚Äôre not nurses, trained counselors, etc.  But they will just discharge people without them having a place to go (they also often just say they‚Äôre coming to my job even if they don‚Äôt tell the patient that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre putting down).  They will just try to push them out, too.  This one hospital was trying to discharge a client of mine naked.  Would not give him clothes (he‚Äôd soiled them during some episode) and I had to drive over an hour to bring him new clothes.  We get people turning up in scrub outfits all the time.
10flbvl,,j505qk1,In 2023.   In a modern society.  Dog help us all
10flbvl,,j4yx78o,>They‚Äôre not supposed to discharge patients without somewhere to go.  Lmao. I wish. They do this all the fucking time.
10flbvl,,j4xo0wv,I feel like there's more, methier details.
10flbvl,,j4yyxh2,Regardless, turning a patient out without their property is pretty fucked up. Especially if it's all they own.
10flbvl,,j50sin0,I‚Äôve had hospitals lose my property and do this. Like years ago when I was housed and even lucky enough to get someone to come pick my shoeless self up, thankfully. They somehow lost my clothes and shoes. Gave me a hospital gown and some scrub pants but had nothing on the shoe front.   And I‚Äôve been discharged quite a few times with nowhere to go. And as a very medically complex patient even. I mean this is part of why I‚Äôm homeless but at some point there aren‚Äôt any real options for what to do with someone. Worse, I sort of had my world completely come undone because I had a jerky doctor adamant I couldn‚Äôt be homeless and stay on the literal form of life support keeping me alive. Hospital‚Äôs ethics team got involved (but I‚Äôve really come to the realization the ethics team isn‚Äôt there to protect the patient. Their job is to protect the hospital. As soon as they realized I didn‚Äôt have anyone who was going to fight for me or hold them accountable if they did whatever they signed off and that was prior to the final decision being made or my discharge even being planned). It‚Äôs noted in my medical chart that I absolutely needed this to survive. They still shoved me out without. So not only was I discharged with nowhere to go, I was discharged without what they even agreed I needed to literally survive.   My whole shitty homeless journey began with months in hospitals. And I‚Äôm still homeless. And ended up displaced to a different state. Have the medical treatment I need to survive (though I‚Äôm the one who had to fight like hell for that even when they kept saying it was impossible and they fucked up the script for it) so I‚Äôd love to go back and do a ‚Äútold you so‚Äù to that first doctor who said there was no way I could be homeless and receive that. One hospital even found a shelter for medically complex folks. But that stupid shelter ended up turning me down because my illness doesn‚Äôt have an end date. Like, wtf, you‚Äôd think if anything that‚Äôs exactly why I need the damn shelter in the first place. And because of the specifics of my medical needs I can‚Äôt really stay in a regular shelter. I‚Äôve been more or less living in a shitty hotel, begging, have a GoFundMe. It‚Äôs been absolute bullshit.   But hospitals do this kind of shit all the dang time. Contrary to what some are saying and implying it really doesn‚Äôt matter if drugs are involved or not. Or even if you‚Äôre severely ill. In theory they try to help. But some try a lot harder than others and sometimes there really isn‚Äôt any other option. And I don‚Äôt think too many people even consider the fact that no one can stay in a hospital indefinitely but where does a homeless person who is too sick to survive on the streets go?   And fucking hell, hospitals so need to all have a ‚Äúshoe bank‚Äù or something. If they‚Äôre losing peoples shoes at the very damn least they need to have something to send people out in.
10flbvl,,j52ffcq,>where does a homeless person who is too sick to survive on the streets go?                   We all know the unspoken answer to this.   I have health problems that got much worse along with new ones that Covid left me with about 15 months ago and then a miracle (not god, lol) happened, I got permanent supportive housing. It saved my life. I still have horrible anxiety that I'm going to end up homeless again, like some how the programs funds will get cut or something.  I tell you what, if I lost this program I would not stick around. Fact.
10flbvl,,j50zr57,Assuming that he actually had shoes when he arrived.
10flbvl,,j4y1tgb,Maybe.  I just hope they reach out.  Help is usually available, but sometimes you need to ask.  Closed mouths don‚Äôt get fed, as they say in prison.
10flbvl,,j502xzp,Sadly no, just had someone call in a wellness check on me and the cop took me there cause he thought I sounded suicidal.  I was drunk on the street so I may have been dumb enough to mention how sad I was as my wallet and phone was stolen/broken the night before.  Could of been the hospital or the ambulance I've no idea I got shot with phenobarbital so it's all hazy.
10flbvl,,j52dw2y,>They‚Äôre not supposed to discharge patients without somewhere to go                  I wish.
10flbvl,,j52ny6x,I‚Äôve learned that  not everywhere has this policy.  Sad.
10flbvl,,j5209sn,Having somewhere to go when you leave the hospital is not mandatory to have a place to go. Heck here in Baltimore there was a big scandal about a hospital literally wheeling a lady in a wheelchair out of the hospital in nothing but a hospital gown and socks and putting her on the bus stop and dumping her here
10flbvl,,j527wi2,It must be just a regional thing.  ‚ÄòDo no harm‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean much if they‚Äôd do that to a vulnerable person
10flbvl,,j580wwu,Yeah just like every profession there is people that want to be there to actually help people and than you have the ones that are only there for a check. Unfortunately the latter are the ones who ruin it for the good ones.
10flbvl,,j585ops,Truth.  I spent several months in the hospital last year and a few of the nurses were about as empathetic as the janitors.   Most were absolutely amazing though.  And the doctors and surgeons went above and beyond.

10flbvl,j508ovl,,Call yourself in suicidal tell them you need mental help. You‚Äôll go to a nut ward but I‚Äôve been to plenty of them. All the food you can eat, showers, sleep, and good company. the Max they can keep you is two weeks due to Medicaid And no insurance issues. They will get you Sandals and a few pairs of socks at least to keep. Maybe some new clothes if they have a donation too.
10flbvl,,j52g3s4,I got to go to a regular mental hospital from the acute care ward. Spent a month there. It was so much better. Majority of the people were super nice and trained well. I liked it. I sorta feel institutionalized though. I've spent almost three years of my life in in-patient rehabs and maybe like 3 months mental ward or mental hospital. 2 weeks jail once and it was awful.

10flbvl,,j50t96c,Are you sure? I had a Michigan hospital lose my clothing and shoes. They gave me a gown and scrub pants and because it was cold, a hospital blanket. But I was shit out of luck on the shoe front because they didn‚Äôt even have the slip ons you speak of. I wasn‚Äôt homeless at the time, thank God, but I still literally left that hospital in socks in the winter. And if it happened to me I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs happened to others.
10flbvl,,j51c7kh,I‚Äôm sure it still happens but they are supposed to provide you with something. I‚Äôve had shoes given to me when I left rehab in Detroit. I‚Äôm sorry you had that experience
10flbvl,,j4y3366,Where would you recommend being homeless in Michigan?
10flbvl,,j507bqx,As someone who's almost homeless in Michigan, get out of Michigan. There are places that are warmer with just as much or more support and less chance of freezing to death.  I've been homeless in southern California and it wasn't so bad, but I legit think Michigan would kill me.
10flbvl,,j521n6p,I saw a post where a girl was asking if it would be a good move to live in Michigan out of her car. I warned her about the deadly cold and dangers of the area and some yahoo came in saying Michigan's great and super successful and safe for homeless.. this was a homeless guy who's been doing it for years giving this advice to a newb. Didn't give any suggestions on how to really stay warm. I peeked his profile and he was constantly talking about how he had to double and triple up on sleeping bags and warm clothes because it was so fucking cold.
10flbvl,,j5257lt,Bruh I feel like I'm freezing just walking outside for an hour, I could never. I'd rather just get rid of everything I own and hop on a bus headed anywhere south west.
10flbvl,,j51cn1y,I agree with what the other person said. I‚Äôm from Detroit and winters were fucked. I‚Äôm in florida now and luckily have housing, but idk if I‚Äôd recommend it. Politics aside, I don‚Äôt care what you believe in, but the red states like florida want to criminalize homelessness. New York is also very cold but they have alot more resources.
10flbvl,,j52gcmh,I would have left and checked myself back in through the ER 20 minutes later complaining of severe pain in my feet from the cold and fear of frostbite. Kinda hard to turn you away and/or not get you shoes then.
10flbvl,j4xitl6,,Damn, i have extra boots. Id give em to you if i could get to you and you were a 10 and half. Go steal some. Id snag a pair off the front of a house. Sometimes people leave them at the front door. Normally I dont condone theft but its dangerous to not have shoes in that weather.
10flbvl,,j4y6tun,I would rather someone take my shoes than lose their feet. He could go to a thrift store and ask for a pair.
10flbvl,,j4yyoah,If someone has to steal from me they must need it much more than I do, I always say.
10flbvl,j4zpucd,,Go to a thrift or charity store and negotiate $1 for some shoes. They'll probably give you them for free and throw in a few more items to help you out. If they say no ask if you can deliver fliers for their business, or put up posters around your area in exchange for the shoes and maybe an item or two more.
10flbvl,j51auo3,,I'm sorry that happened to you OP, stay strong.
10flbvl,j535zj9,,aww, gees im sorry you went thru that. its so messed up that HOS do that. i hope you are ok
10flbvl,j4xlqy1,,Steal some from Walmart
10flbvl,,j4zdbz8,I buy the shoes and tents I give to homeless people from Walmart. I couldnt afford to buy them anyplace else. Which makes all the WalHate here kind of funny.
10flbvl,,j4y6322,Don't be a thief have some fucking ethics.
10flbvl,,j4y8a6f,Do you complain to walmart about their rampant wage theft?
10flbvl,,j4y9wl8,you see walmart's feet will be very cold tonight without the shoes.
10flbvl,,j4yecva,Nobody truly understands the struggle of the Waltons
10flbvl,,j4ypwvx,Well they *are* on the hook for another $148M to Broncos QB Russell Wilson no matter what, so the loss of a single pair of boots will put the Waltons' $226 Billion fortune at risk.
10flbvl,,j4yqvv5,Thoughts and prayers
10flbvl,,j4ygn6u,Thanks for the giggle.
10flbvl,,j4y79zx,Stealing from individuals is unethical, stealing from multinational corporations is not. Walmart isnt being deprived of anything here besides profit.  The only cause for hesitation is the legal trouble it may bring.
10flbvl,,j4yl8w6,‚úäü•Ä Seize the means of foot function!  Legal trouble? You mean hots, cots, showers and shoes? Seems like an improvement over being barefoot in sub-freezing weather either outcome.
10flbvl,,j4ygztv,Walmart gets no love around these parts.
10flbvl,,j4yivx4,Don't get me wrong fuck Walmart but fuck thieves too.
10flbvl,,j4yme1a,Yeah, a guy dumped out of a mental hospital without shelter or shoes would be a real asshole for stealing from a company with half a trillion dollars in annual revenue. Because that would be the most ethically dubious act in this story.  What the hell is wrong with you?   If you don't think shoplifting is moral, pay for your own shoes. It you see a shoeless man stealing shoes, keep your god damn yap shut.
10flbvl,,j4ynbza,You act like it's all stealing or not having anything. There's dozens of other options. Dozens of other options that don't involve the risk of adding up a ton of petty arrests on your record that'll keep you from ever being able to get out of the shit you're in. Any church will buy this person shoes. You don't have to steal you choose to steal. But I guess I'm one of the Unicorn homeless that doesn't Panhandle or Steal or blame society for the situation I'm in.
10flbvl,,j4yq5ll,You're like, well, Homeless Jesus. You deserve a big ol' pat on the back but since you're doing such a great job of that yourself we'll just let you keep at it.
10flbvl,,j4ytomo,*slow claps*
10flbvl,,j4yyhlc,You remind me of that hatchet wielding hitchhiker.
10flbvl,,j4z09iu,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ  I'm not sure why but I don't even care that was funny as fuck lol.  Didn't that dude end up killing some old man and going to prison?
10flbvl,,j4z0dyg,Yup..  After Kai was charged, fans from his days of viral fame raised a legal fund for him ‚Äî he defended himself on the stand, but was ultimately¬†found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 57 years in prison.
10flbvl,,j4z1v9s,Haha I just watched the doc on Netflix about him. I also thought it would be funny to say so I said it. üòÇ
10flbvl,,j4ylmqt,Do normies just come here to gawk at the internet hobo? What the hell are you even doing here?
10flbvl,,j4ylx59,I'm homeless as fuck doesn't mean I Need To Be A thieving ass degenerate.
10flbvl,,j4yn8ok,How fortunate of you. When someone as rich as a Walton sees you and sees OP, they don't see you as different at all, no matter who you decide you're better than.
10flbvl,,j4yofru,You don't get it it's not about you or them or being better than anyone else it's about being able to live with yourself. I refuse to become desensitized to the shame that comes along with begging people for money and stealing things from stores. I'm no fucking expert but I'm pretty sure that's the first thing you have to do to be homeless for the rest of your fucking life.
10flbvl,,j52i78i,There is no shame in fighting against a corporation that is exploiting the workers, the customers, and the taxpayers. I am staunchly opposed to theft once you leave the realm of basic needs and that includes capitalist exploitation.
10flbvl,,j4ymhwz,We may be in the same league, but we're not on the same team.
10flbvl,,j4ymplz,And I thank God for that.
10flbvl,,j52hqp4,Stealing basic needs from a corporation that already steels from its workers, runs mom and pop businesses out of towns, pays below a living wage, and relies on the government and people paying taxes to subsidize Wal-Mart's payroll is not wrong. I won't go as far as to say its right either but we are talking about basic necessities.                     As for panhandling (with a sign so as not to harass people) all I have to say is better a better than a thief any day. I couldn't always get work right when I needed it or make enough so I did what I had to do without hurting anyone.
10flbvl,j4y9vxs,,That's THE worst, I feel your pain.      My fiance held all my shit hostage when we broke up a handful of times. By "Held my shit hostage" I mean EVERYTHING.      A few times all I had was 2 tshirts, a hoodie, a pair of socks, 2 pairs of leggings, and a ponytail holder. That's it. No place to stay at all, no food, no phone (or any way to communicate with ppl), No drugs (I was/still am fighting a severe addiction so it was ROUGH going without), and NO SHOES.   It rlly was the fucking worst thing ever.       I didn't even have to deal with the cold like you but I did have to deal with nonstop rain & 100 degree temps. My feet stayed wet 24/7 and we're torn to shreds from walking around in only socks for weeks.      It got to the point where I had a really bad infection of some sort on the tops of both of my feet (I imagine from the constant wetness). One of them was so SO bad. My foot - & eventually my leg - started randomly cramping up & giving out when I'd try to walk. I finally got my bike back & I couldn't even ride it.       My feet were sunburned too because at some point I had to get rid of the socks (too many holes). My dad bought me a piat of flip flops & some sweatpants since it was all they had at Walmart on clearance. He only had 11 bucks to his & no place to stay himself.   Thank God for my dad.      The flip flops made it worse though! I got cuts that were so deep/hurt so bad (where the little plastic piece goes between your toes) that i couldn't even stand up for 3 days! I also had to stay in a bedbug infested house & in a tent in the woods where 100s of mesquitos - yes I mean literally hundreds of them - would swarm me  the second I walked near my campsite.       So, I ended up with bed bug bites that I had scratched huge holes in, tons of mesquito bites (even on the soles of my feet), + many cuts, scrapes, & blisters. And a fucking TICK that was in between my toes. I was too lethargic/sick/scared to pull it out so I left it in for 5 days.   My feet literally looked like zombie feet (lol). They sure as hell didn't look like they belonged on anyone who was alive to say the least.   I still have scars & pain from that and it was back in June 2022.   TLDR: Even if you have to steal em get you some close toed shoes 2DAY so you don't end up with "zombie feet."
10flbvl,,j4zgh2i,Didn't go quite that far but walked a lot very barefoot and at some point I just stopped feeling my feet
10flbvl,j4xzd7e,,sent you a message
10flbvl,j4xwtcj,,I might have a pair of men shoes that I don‚Äôt need but I doubt you‚Äôre in my area
10flbvl,j5473qr,,Type in your city on Reddit or Facebook and make a post saying exactly this and I bet someone has some shoes for u.
10flbvl,j548z1d,,I was homeless for 7 years bro, i feel ya but don't give UP! You'll catch a break eventually!
10fgvj5,j4wwzc5,,If you can't make it through a rain storm, then this lifestyle  isn't for you.  It's 20 degrees here, wind's blowing 22 mph, and 14 inches of snow is on the ground.  You're gonna have to thoughen up a bit, and go one day at a time if you want to survive out here.
10fgvj5,j4wsg8e,,If you want to keep moving on, I hope you do. If there was a poll for this post I would vote for you to sleep on the sidewalk rather than jumping. It seems like you are going through your own version of hell. I just would not want to see it get worse.   It is far too common for suicide attempts to go wrong and just make life much more difficult. It is why I advocate for the option of voluntary assisted dying for adults because life can be absolutely terrible, even if it can be amazing at times. I would not want people to be encouraged to end their lives, but a compassionate and more effective method versus train tracks is an option I think all humans deserve.  I hope you are able to find some work soon to help out your situation. Cheers.
10fgvj5,j4x16m6,,If nothing is working for you there, go somewhere else.
10fgvj5,j4xpifn,,Just move on
10fgvj5,j4xtvid,,Right, move on down south.
10ffsuu,j4x7dqx,,people always judge people that they don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôm not homeless but I live with severe chronic pain. I‚Äôm here looking to help someone out, but the thing is one of my friends chose to be homeless and does tons of drugs. I‚Äôve tried really hard to not be judgmental. The answer I‚Äôve found to most things is when people look at groups things get bad but when you look at an individual you can see the humanity in each person‚Äôs story. But most people don‚Äôt have the time to care.
10ffsuu,j4yqntp,,Because you're the one percent homeless that's online, that's actually in a homeless situation. The other 99 percent. Are actors. And they been exposed and caught, and they have homes, yet they put on their homeless and nomad character for views. People are also gonna assume, if you have time and means to record. And set a camera up etc. Why can't you work? When they can shut up, and go to hell. People can be so ignorant. Who's gonna hire someone homeless with no suit, gaps in their resume, or no address, etc. It's steps we take to get our lives back etc.   What I'm about to tell you, you're not gonna like. But I would avoid video blogging about being homeless unfortunately. We deal with shit IRL, but we don't need to deal with it online. However, you can post videos about nature, hiking, foraging etc. Just don't do any poverty porn vlogs, as that's gonna cause issues.
10ffsuu,j4wmdj2,,Social medias bad but you seen the treatment in real life? That shit is horrible
10ffsuu,j4xc38j,,Ong I literally realized gen z is rude af when it comes to anyone that is struggling financially/mentally. These kids are so spoiled ofc they are mean to homeless. Flip them off and walk away they‚Äôre not that smart
10ffsuu,j4ypryl,,I will never forget when a nurse at a hospital I was staying at ivernigyt to not die in winter commented with a bunch of other nurses why I shouldn't have my phone. It was a literal life line to me but they thought I didn't deserve it because I was homeless.
10ffsuu,,j4zfoj2,Those nurses are ignorant. They‚Äôd sing a different tune if the roles were reversed. I‚Äôd rather be aware of the truth around us, than be a naive snob like them.
10ffsuu,j4xs1hm,,Many of those people are borderline sociopathic. They have no empathy or sympathy for those of us going through homelessness. I try to avoid reading those nasty comments. Social media has desensitized humanity towards the pain of others.
10ffsuu,j4z0orj,,I work for the Goodwill and have only narrowly avoided homelessness a few times now in the past 7 months. I work on the e-commerce side though, packing boxes. One of my coworkers started talking shit about some of the homeless people that hang out near our building that are outside our door sometimes. Some of them do have obvious drug problems (we see them doing it) but most of them are just like me. I had to work real hard to keep my mouth civil when he started saying something because not only am I living on the brink but *we have coworkers on our team who are homeless right now and have a full time job* because we are in one of the most overpriced and unhelpful cities in the country (Seattle). I skew older (I'm a Xennial) but there are so many fucking people now, in real life and social media, who just. Don't. Get it. They don't get how much built in privilege you have to have just to literally not starve nowadays. My father and his wife ruined my finances, my education, my social life and I have a host of my own struggles besides; I have barely been able to pick up the pieces, and I'm *lucky*. These idiots on social media especially, where there are no consequences for shit spewing to an audience because no one can heckle you - I'm not going to say kids, because I'm not lumping you in like that, OP - have reached this point where they are simply so insulated from the realities of the world we live in now in America that those of us that aren't like them are not only invisible, but we're living proof that their whole reality is founded on lies, money, privilege and exploitation and so they hate and fear us.
10ffsuu,j50oriq,,Not just on social media. Everywhere homeless are treated awful. People assume you‚Äôre a drug addict or lazy. They try to find reasons to justify your situation and convince themselves you deserve it because of your own doing. I guess it‚Äôs easier for them to do that then to realize it‚Äôs the system that puts homeless people in that situation. People can‚Äôt really rap their brain around homelessness in a country where there is so much wealth because then they would have to acknowledge their own privilege.
10ffsuu,j547oti,,Because there are so many assholes in our world who think that I can‚Äôt happen to them so they hide behind a screen and talk crap to anyone less fortunate, because they know they‚Äôd never have the guts to do it in the real world. These are those I wouldn‚Äôt have fighting on my sore were it ever a situation. Cowards.
10ffsuu,j549k7f,,Sure. I'll get a job with: no shower, no clean clothes, no alarm clock, no vehicle, no resume, no food, etc. I wish every human HAD to be homeless for a few months lol like it should be mandatory.
10ffsuu,j507rn1,,What I hate about homeless people is that some of them don‚Äôt care about the environment. They leave trash behind them.  And when I see that happening in my city it kind of feels like every homeless does that, and maybe that‚Äôs why people assume that every homeless is the same, but it‚Äôs not.
10ffsuu,j50c5vn,,I blame the woke movement making it about race, sexual identity, sexual orientation, corporate sponsorship, and voting for a party not a bill or past politicians voting record as a representative.    So woke to social Justice only if it can be sold by a top 40 artist..‚Ä¶. We live in disgusting times.
10ffsuu,j4zfqpi,,Spoiler alert: Homeless people get treated like garbage everywhere.   Just had a friend of mine get his camp swept. By DOT. In the middle of winter. In the rain. Breaking one of his tent poles in the process. He was sitting in his tent reading when they came up. They all commented on how clean his campsite was. He had to just walk away before he did something he would regret.
10ffsuu,,j5bztwb,Jesus would invite your friend to live with him. Why do you not do the same, Christian?
10ffsuu,,j5c1dez,He's an extreme claustrophobic. He can barely ride in a car for a few blocks. I can get him to the nearby laundromat and Walmart, thats about it. He's refused a motel room the last few times I've offered. He gets cranky if I give him too much money too often. But he always looks forward to the bags of books I bring him.
10ffsuu,j5152xj,,There's so much baggage with this question, where to begin?
10ffsuu,j5xp0qs,,Because there are a lot of people out there who are self-centred and lazy. Rather than have a bit of respect for other people by making themselves aware of the broken system that leads to so many homeless, they would rather be disrespectful and lazy by asking us to repeat ourselves over and over to describe the terrible circumstances that led to our situation. Either that or they have an itching to slander us and make us feel worse because they are 'projecting' from their own sadness and anger of their own personal circumstances.
10ffsuu,j4z934n,,Some people go the homeless way as they're trying to escape this ridiculous rent and inflation. Seems though, it can cost some pretty good money to get into a position to prepare for it.  Others can fade into it from things pulled out of a bottle. That is booze and prescription drugs.  Then they're some whom fall into it from too much debt that becomes overwhelming.   Point is they will always be people who want to b*tch about something. In this case, it's about homelessness. I can turn on the news sometimes and some city is going to have to vacate, move and clean out a homeless camp, folks have set up because the well-to-dos are fussing at Commissioners about it stinking up their property values or whatever.  This is just the way life is these days. You always going to have certain ones griping at others about something.  You just have to grow a thick skin to ignore them and deal with it. Hey, it works too. It states in the good book, "let him without sin cast the first stone," and "don't  judge others lest ye be judged."  Nobody is better than anyone else! Those that think they're better than you have to put on the same big boy pants you wear. Why you let them anger or tempt you? In reality, you just might be in better financial shape than their current situation.   Learn to adapt and overcome what bothers you. Learning to control both emotions and thoughts crosses out negativity. Nothing good comes from harnessing bad thoughts and negative actions.  Now my understanding from the Holy book is that Jesus was homeless too! I know what I read out of it says nothing about him having gold and silver with a nice concrete slab mansion on another side of a river.  He walked most everywhere, slept out under the stars, born in a barn, ate what he was offered, stayed with friends, neighbors or family sometimes.  Now that is something to think about my friend. Powerful words written there.
10fd02h,j4w3mka,,Hated free clothes when I was a kid but not anymore.
10fd02h,,j4w7dpj,I wish I could go back in time and thank the people that gave me socks for gifts. I didn‚Äôt appreciate it enough at the time
10fd02h,j4whov6,,Omg clean socks are fuckin amazing
10fd02h,j4w7rcr,,I thought so too, until I realized that sandals really are the way to go for hygiene... just not in freezing weather.  Really sucks that when you dry sweaty socks without washing them they get crusty, and wearing them again causes holes to form faster.
10fd02h,j4xezxk,,Hey shoot me a message, I got you
10fd02h,j51pmcl,,Strangely, here in Detroit socks are everywhere. But there seems to be an incredible shortage and need for belts..

10fd02h,j4znini,,Something I learned hunting. The morning dew on many low laying trees is PURE clean water, and smells good. It might help to clean you up, but I don't know about drying off much
10fb4ev,j4wqooe,,It‚Äôs why people would rather be out on the street then in shelters. Also knowing someone in the shelter you knew, or you did something too them. Good luck not catching a knife in the back!!
10fb4ev,j4xxwru,,I wish I had good news, but just put up with it a stay to yourself as you get things in order.. I 2 weeks ago walked out the other side, I bounced around everywhere for 3 years last was a government subsidized transitional housing and I tried to report things and simply no one cares.  There are ways out, I got a good job and saved up and am now in a nice 2 bedroom normal apartment with out government assistance.  It is rough, but it doesn't have to last forever.
10fb4ev,j4yfcwo,,just focus on yourself and your dog , i'm sure people are aware but like you said they might be stretched very thin , obviously they must be quite calm and orderly or wouldnt the caretakers of the shelter call the police on them??
10fb4ev,,j4yh6mn,2 of the addicts have been very threatening towards me and my dog, a third one was stealing my dog's food. I've made the people in charge aware of this, and all I've gotten is either no response, or "we can't do anything about that."  One woman who was here was a terroristic bully - constant yelling, screaming, treating people like trash, making false accusations, and very little was done with her.
10fb4ev,,j4z3qe1,oh, i'm so sorry to hear that . can you try to get in another shelter? just try to avoid conflict i pray things get better for you, by the way i didnt know you allowed dogs in the shelter?  i love dogs and i pray God will bless you with a better situation for you and your puppy
10fb4ev,,j561yot,I was sexually assaulted in my sleep at a shelter. This woman crawled into my bed and touched me. I told on her and the guards told me to ‚Äúwork it out with her‚Äù. So yeah, they don‚Äôt care. Get some ear phones and read a book. It could be worse. I hated the shelter too!
10fb4ev,j4zgnuu,,Man I hope you got a gun or something with you‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not trying to be an asshole but do you have a job? Or a way to go out and maybe move to a different area and start again? I was a security guard at a shelter here in Cali for 3 weeks. Shelters are definitely where you see the worst of humanity. I wish you nothing but the best and don‚Äôt let others to pet your dog, they‚Äôll try to make him used to them and won‚Äôt bark when they sneak behind you.
10fb4ev,,j53hq8q,I limit who my dog interacts with. One of the meth heads has threatened to throw water on me and my dog, another barks at my dog, and yet another one was stealing her food. That just leaves me wondering what it is about meth that makes people torment an innocent dog.  As per the rules of this shelter, nobody is allowed to have anything that could be considered a weapon, but what I have, I use as tools, not weapons. Great for cutting up food, or rope or string.
10fb4ev,j54abu8,,Dude just leave them alone and don't tell on them, you're gonna get a name as a snitch and that's super dangerous on the street! It may get you stabbed beaten or killed, just ignore them and keep to yourself. Jesus man, did you just get out on the streets?! Be careful for chrissake. I lived on the street for 7 years bro.
10fb4ev,j55yq8f,,Just keep to yourself! I was in a ladies shelter in Phoenix and most of ladies were on drugs and snuck in alcohol. Don‚Äôt talk to them. And don‚Äôt tell on them. They are humans who deserve shelter too!
10fb4ev,j4y6tq1,,That‚Äôs definitely something that could cause them to lose their status as a non profit. The possibility of losing grants, funding and tax exemptions would likely make some changes.

10fb4ev,,j4yn38d,Where‚Äôs the humor?
10fb4ev,,j4yd6ly,They're not getting grants, to my knowledge. A few months ago, they were doing a lot of work in an attempt to get grants, but they stopped trying. They were even trying to get a church down the road to put this shelter in the church's monthly donations.  This place is bad. Mold in the showers, incredibly inadequate cleaning supplies (a schizophrenic who hoards all cleaning supplies she finds doesn't help), there's a guy who claims to have warrants, the tree house is a safety hazard if anybody goes up there, and it's a potential hazard to people under the influence of drugs and mental diagnosis that detach them from reality.  This place is the fish bowl for people from local churches and the local university to 'come see the poor homeless people, I am so glad I'm not one of them.'
10fb4ev,,j4ymyjj,Some grants don‚Äôt take much. Just having residents, being open 24 hours, serving meals. Offering the bare minimum can qualify for grants.
10fb4ev,j4vqdqx,,All shelters have drug problems.  What's your point?
10fb4ev,,j500h07,Maybe try reading it again?     His point seems pretty obvious to me.
10f96pr,j4vbxxe,,Essentially she kicks me out almost daily when I'm helping and trying to take care of her 11 YO son.. I do so much for her but I don't have any family and when she's mad or angry I'm sent to sleep or find somewhere else to live. She's costed me multiple jobs by showing up and causing a scene when all I'm trying to do is work.. help pay her bills and help her son.. so now I'm actually choosing to live out in the streets and leave the toxicity of this relationship.. I've never been homeless before, I stole the pool chair pads from our complex to make a bed in this parking garage where I'm at the top floor and most likely won't be walked in on. Any advice would be great.
10f96pr,,j4x0kfa,>any advice would be great.  The only advice is to peacefully break up with her immediately and cease all contact.

10f96pr,,j4vri57,Have you tried calling the hotline for Homeless Veterans? Texas isn't the friendliest state to people experiencing homelessness but they do an *okay* job for ex-military experiencing homelessness.

I only have experience navigating the system in California but feel free to send me a DM if you need help figuring out next steps.

10f96pr,,j4ytw9p,Yeah I hear all that and I'm game but what would I use as a heating source? Some sort of Coleman camping propane tank and a rack? I'm not a thief but I can't afford that until I get my first paycheck

10f96pr,j4w2dhs,,Brother, if she is kicking you out ‚Äúalmost daily‚Äù as you have said, you need to run for the hills. And very fast. Speaking from experience - this woman will NOT be satisfied until she destroys you. Being spiritually dead is worse than being physically dead imo and this is what she is doing.   Get your place sorted out as soon as you can, and crash at family/friends houses in the meantime if you can. But leave that ungrateful *woman* alone.   Then find you a nice woman deserving of your goodness. Stop playing step daddy role as well man. Not trying to be disrespectful. You need to sort this out asap otherwise I promise you destruction will follow.  Also if she ‚Äúchanges‚Äù it‚Äôs a ploy, don‚Äôt go back
10f96pr,,j4w2vho,Ugh fuck it's rough man but I'm reading everything your saying and I can't find an argument against it..

10f96pr,,j4w5fh1,Well said. Some women genuinely just want to utterly destroy your soul and make sure you're at absolute rock bottom. 3 years or so I lost (more fool me for not realising sooner). OP, time to forget about her. Move on and get a fresh start. I wish you all the best for your future.
10f96pr,j4xvmy6,,Bro , why the fuck are you still talking to this girl? I would‚Äôve cut this bitch out of my life the moment she showed up at my job.   That‚Äôs not your kid , she‚Äôs abusive and mentally deranged. Get the fuck out already.

I just have no family and my documents like birth certificate social card dd214 is in her apartment which now I don't even want to go to without a police escort.

10f96pr,j4zdzke,,Put YOU first. Cut and dry man she has a kid. Not even your kid and you‚Äôre homeless because of it. That‚Äôs so wrong.

10f96pr,j4xf3ai,,Biggest things I recommend, based on the other things that you posted, is to try to find a way to keep yourself clean for your job (gym, bathrooms, whatever you need). Other than that, make sure you make this a clean break, you don't want to be playing ping pong.  Think of it as some 'going to the field' nostalgia. Keep your head up, be smart and safe about where you sleep, and you've got things in place to get yourself through no problem. Hopefully the VA assistance line can help you out some.
10f96pr,j4y05ws,,always stay clean. clean cloths. clean body. i would work on getting a vehicle first then get a apartment. you will need some good credit. you can use credit karma to check yours. library's area great place to us a computer and print documents. Tax season is coming so if you get ready for that, it could be a few extra hundred bucks for you.
10f96pr,,j4z5om2,I'm a bartender so tax season usually ends up with me paying the government, somehow... 5 years in a row so far and I'm sure things won't be different this year.
10f96pr,,j6lrstk,I see. Yeah I did have to owe the government this year. Luckily I was able to do some write off because I did door dash for a few months. There might be ways you can get a tax break too maybe. Like with fuel, car repairs or something.
10f96pr,j4zfpl5,,U can use Vrbo which is exactly like Airbnb but it has an option to pay for your stay with zero down and pay for it in payments using affirm.

My payment is $61 a month‚Ä¶ not too bad
10f96pr,j4w6h0j,,It's a bad feeling to be out in the world needing something like a tent or a tool or gadget, and knowing that thing is at your ex wife's house gathering dust and she won't talk to you.  I miss having a bidet and a washing machine that texts you, but having to buy a tool I already bought so I can fix my broken car is pretty lame.

10f08tc,j4u4xjr,,I'll be honest - pets adjust. That's a hard truth. I have lived with my roommate since August and he has a *very fucked up dog* that we love to death. I am a dog person and since I moved in, the dog has now become incredibly attached to both of us. 90% of the time, one or the other of us is home and he is always with one of us - or both. We also have mental health issues (mine are pretty severe) and I don't socialize much anymore, which adds to the dog attachment. He was alone for 15 minutes the other day between when my roommate left and when I got home from getting some dinner, and the dog literally crawled into my sweatshirt because he missed me so much (he is a 90 lbs German Shepherd mix; I am a 195lbs 6'3" man, but my clothes are only so big).  My roommate does travel sometimes, though, and when he is gone, I have to leave the dog alone during the day while I'm at work. And he is okay. It normally takes him a day to adjust, but then he learns to self-soothe. And while he is definitely by my side the whole time that I am home (he was very badly abused for the first two years of his life, and we suspect he may have been involved in dog fighting or something that involved another dog attacking him constantly, so he gets incredibly attached to people as his caregivers), he also learns quickly to cope without having me around all the time. Animals *aren't* people. They aren't. They don't have metacognition, not really, they don't think like we do. They get attached to us, but they don't understand what we *are.* Your cats are the same. They are very attached to you, but they are more attached to survival. If your cats have a good home to go to, there will be an adjustment period for them, but they will survive and thrive, especially if you trust the person that will foster them and you continue to visit them.   Also, from the way you have phrased your post, it sounds like your cats have never actually had to be away from you, so you don't know how they will react - and because animals don't think like us, you have to change how you think about their behavior. Our animals don't see us as "human family." They see us as companions that are a *way for them to survive.* Dogs are domesticated. Cats are commensal. Domestic cats specifically have evolved to approximately mimic the cry of a human baby to keep your attention in that way and to stimulate that part of the human animal brain. In that way, they co-opt our own deeply rooted biological behaviors to survive. Your cat wants your attention because it has evolved to want it and you have evolved to prioritize it because of how it sounds. Our pets have also evolved to stimulate the release of oxytocin in our brains, which is why we look at our pets and go "omg I have to just SQUISH HIM UNTIL HE BECOMES A PART OF MY BODY HE'S SUCH A GOOD BOY". I do that literally every day. I look at the dog over and over and my brain just goes "look at this cute thing I need to have it I want to carry it around with me everywhere and take care of it." He has literally evolved to do that to me. Both dogs and cats also offer humans other benefits besides, but that is tangential here. Both dogs and cats are programmed biologically to highjack our brains to ensure we care for them, and cats especially stimulate the parts of human brains that make us care for them kind of like babies. This is also why cats and dogs learn tricks so fast, including attention seeking tricks - they just know that the more we lavish them with attention, the longer they will be taken care of and survive. We give in to that normally and reward them for being cute with more attention and love and pets and food, and the cycle repeats.  But all this happens because our pets are animals and they want to survive.   Like any living thing, your cats will definitely have an adjustment period. They *will* experience distress because they will be in a new environment where they have to learn how to seek out care and feeding and how to get it, but assuming your friend who is fostering them similarly likes and cares for cats, they will adapt. Your friend will need to take care with the avoidant cat, of course, but it will come around. The best thing you can do for them is to ensure that they are properly cared for in a way that is similar to how you care for them now, but you have to trust in the resilience of your animals becuase that is what they are and why we have them around, too - it's not just to comfort us, but it demonstrates resilience, too.   Finally, and it's important to stress this - pets *aren't* human people. This doesn't mean that they are robots or something, and they are people, of a sort but they *aren't* human people. They do not have the same kinds of thoughts and feelings we do and very importantly, they do not experience trauma in the same way that we do. They definitely *DO* experience trauma, but they simply don't process it in the way that we do and they don't become traumatized by things the way that we do. As long as your pet is getting its physical needs met - food, water, shelter, medicine, safety, etc. - that is paramount, and they will likely adapt. I know that sounds weird to think about, but our pets don't lie awake at night wondering about why we suddenly "don't seem to love them anymore," as they don't understand that we love them - they only understand that we demonstrate that love through care and physical affection. They *will* fixate on why we stopped feeding them, or if suddenly we react differently to one of their behaviors, but they don't think about it that way. They have an inner life but it is constrained by their limited grasp of the world, which itself is constrained by how their memories work, and they have no proper theory of mind. They *will* miss *you* specifically - but again, as long as you minimize the changes in how they are treated and interacted with, they will do okay.   Don't take your cats with you. Please don't. I have had a few friends fall into that trap out of the belief that it will "be too hard on their pet because they will miss me too much" and every time, the pet dies. Every. Time. A plan that minimizes the changes to ease the transition would be something along the lines of ensuring that they have the same litter boxes and the same kind of cat litter, that feeding happens at the same time each day if you do it that way, that you don't change their cat food, that they have access to their same kind of toys, things like that. Ensuring that physical care remains as close to what you give them now is the absolute best thing you can do.
10f08tc,,j4u64ji,Thank you for this. I read all of it and you explained it all really well. I do think that animals have at least a pack-like relationship with their long term human and that it‚Äôs not all just about survival, but you‚Äôre right that they aren‚Äôt going to dwell on things and ponder over it vs just react and continue. That‚Äôs what I needed to hear. Thank you man.   I never put my own emotions over the well being of someone/something I care about so I won‚Äôt be doing that in this case either. My cats will have a safe home to stay healthy in while I figure my life out, so there‚Äôs no problem on that front.   You seem like a cool guy who can hold a good convo. If you ever wanna chat my inbox is open. Been trying to see the best in the situation so learning peoples stories are part of that.

10f08tc,j4uuo7w,,Hopefully you will be able to visit them. That will help in their adjustment. You need to try to find yourself a place to stay in the next few weeks. Have you called  any shelters?
10f08tc,j4u3nbg,,You have 6 weeks until you're homeless. Is that not enough time to find another room or other place to rent? The cats will adjust to a new home. I'm more worried about you missing them.

10f08tc,j4wllkl,,Take the best one with you
10f08tc,j4y1938,,They'll be ok...  I when things were going normal took in a cat from someone in your situation and he was very loving to me,. I'm sure he still loved his original family, but they adjust.   I cried when I saw this, if there is any way you can at least keep in contact with them do, when things went bad for me I lost my cat (a different one after the first lived a good life) and I will never see him again. It hurts more than the time I was homeless or the people I lost.  I hope I'm helping and not making it worse.

10eo2h0,,j4w9nia,Yeah, better idea, since he doesn't seem to like the idea of taking help.
10eo2h0,j4sd4jx,,You should try and see if there is a Street Outreach team in your town, or in a larger town nearby.  This sounds like it could be a dementia related or anxiety case. Even social workers who spend months have a difficult time convincing individuals in this state.  He will most-likely not accept donated pants because he may be emotionally/irrationally attached to the ones he's wearing.
10eo2h0,j4tx30f,,Sometimes it just do be like that.  Really though. Some people don't want help. Either he's cogent and making this choice, in which case that's on him and you can't really (and honestly shouldn't) do anything, or (and this is more likely) he is...not entirely with the rest of us anymore, and you're likely not qualified to make that judgment. If he *is* that far gone, it's pretty...it's murky, you know?   As long as he isn't exposing his bum and then doing something like pooping and eating it, it's best to just let him freeze his butt off. Maybe he'll learn. Maybe it's Maybelline.   I mean maybe he won't.
10eo2h0,j5092z0,,Maybe he has given up on life and therefore, just refuses all the help. Who knows? Not much you can do here but thank you for having a heart

If she's not receiving Social Security but is old enough to draw benefits, a nursing home would certainly help fill out the paperwork to get that rolling in order to get her a bed.
10ei5ij,,j4rknw2,She seems to be all there mentally. We talk and I give her rides and she can carry on a decent conversation. I think she's around 65. I don't know any of her personal info. But I think she's been homeless for years.   I have not checked with nursing homes. She seems to know a lot about the systems and continually tells me there is not help coming from the govt. But I will continue to look for available resources.
10ei5ij,,j4rve7a,>a nursing home would certainly help fill out the paperwork to get that rolling in order to get her a bed.  The medical standard to get into a nursing home is very high and I doubt she'd qualify.  You have to be gravely impaired or disabled to get in; you can't get into a nursing home solely for homelessness/housing problems.    Medicare also *does not* pay for a nursing home, that's Medicaid.  If their income is over 1200 or so, they won't qualify for Medicaid.  Also if assets are over 2k they won't either.  You can find the Medicaid requirements for your state online.
10ei5ij,j4r98i6,,Look into helping her get benefits. If she is unable to work, she may be eligible for ssi/ssdi, and she could get a small, cheap place with that money. Applying can be very difficult, so I'm sure your help would go a long way. She may need assistance getting to appointments to get proof of her inability to work.
10ei5ij,,j4rl0nb,She has food stamps or EBT (250/month). But its weird because they cant buy fast food with it. She can only buy groceries which don't work well when you don't have any place to cook. So I think a lot of that actually goes to waste. Or just doesn't get used.
10ei5ij,,j4somr9,Some states do allow fast food purchases but the individual fast food place has to agree to it.  Call 211 to see if anything can be done.  If it is bitter cold there call the non-emergency police number and see if there are any warming centers in your area. Also google free meals near me or senior centers that offer meals; there is a small charge, but it is pretty good usually. Check craigslist for rooms to rent from someone if she has the funds.  In a pinch she can hang out at 24 hour coffee shops or restaurants but it can be a bit iffy.  I‚Äôve walked the halls in bigger hotels to get out of the cold, enjoyed their free breakfasts when I was desperate, and used their public bathrooms for a quick cleanup.  Bigger hotels often need dishwashers, laundry staff etc.  Never hurts to apply.
10ei5ij,,j4rlb4u,Ebt is definitely good, but not good enough. Ssi/ssdi will likely be around $1000 a month in cash money. It varies from state to state and can also vary based on past work history. That'll be the best bet for her to get on her feet.
10ei5ij,,j4rluug,Oh nice. I didn't know about that. Can definitely look into it. Thanks
10ei5ij,,j4t3jry,Getting ssi can take years, and it is worse since covid started. A previous commenter was unfortunately right, unless you pay for the place, there isn't anything. No miracle govt money is going to appear. Affordable housing is nearly nonexistent and it requires credit scores, stable income, etc to get into a place. I am glad you are trying to help, but it's REALLY bad out here. It took me and my boo a long time to even find an affordable weekly rate hotel that had rooms where you could open the windows. It's going to take us many, many months to *maybe* scrape enough for a place and we are two able bodied young adults.
10ei5ij,,j4wxblq,>No miracle govt money is going to appear.  It's worse than that, because the media puts out the general impression to regular people that there ***are*** resources, they just need to 'work hard to find them'.  A great example of this is LAHSA in California.  I believe in CA they even passed a special added sales tax just to deal w homelessness.  And look where all the money goes, to administrators in these non-profits making mid to high 6 figures.  They even INVENT new words to cover up their gross abuse of public funds, such as 'housing resistant'.  Who the hell is 'resistant' to not being miserable living on the street?
10ei5ij,,j4t3tok,That extra $200 a month will disappear at the end of Feb. There was a covid supplement of sorts that will be expiring. When biden admin renewed the public health emergency, they did not include EBT. Just a heads up, she's gonna likely need more help come March.
10ei5ij,j4t365y,,Ideally she should either be working or receiving Social Security or something. A go fund me isn‚Äôt a good way to go for ongoing expenses like rent etc. This isn‚Äôt the kind of thing anyone can or should be expected to fix for someone, this is where the government needs to step in. She needs income based subsidized housing or permanent supportive housing.
10ei5ij,j4r57el,,Maybe try looking up any social workers?  Also, if she goes to the hospital and tells them she‚Äôs suicidal by law they can‚Äôt discharge to homeless. They‚Äôll put her in a boarding home. But be aware, a lot of these places are sketchy and not the best‚Ä¶
10ei5ij,j4sqtyr,,At 65 I think she's eligible for SSI retirement if she lacks work credits
10ei5ij,,j4szxhk,I just applied today for an appointment. They will be calling me next week. Its kind of crazy but she gave me all her personal info so I kind of unofficially represent her. He said she used to work but it must have been a long time ago. She is very comfortable living on the street and sometimes I think I'm more concerned about her being outside than she is.
10ei5ij,,j4t0nl7,Hoorah. After obtaining SSI she can get Medicaid and eventually get subsidized housing. Not every place takes years. She might not want to go to this town and her SSI might not be enough for it, but just as an example, I found a one bedroom for 729 with only 15 people waiting. All those 15 won't even still want it. Bless you for helping her.

10ei5ij,j4r93bo,,She has no family?
10ei5ij,,j4rlmlq,Its weird. She has a son that I know of because he has come by when we were meeting. But I think he's in a tough spot too. He works but doesn't seems to have much to offer her. But I don't ask too many questions. She keeps saying she wants to work, but I don't know if she's just saying it because she feels its what she is supposed to say.   But to work you need a place to sleep and clean up I would guess. And she has none of that. Just a couple bags.   She was staying at a bus stop but they cops moved her to a location behind a church. So strange. I thought they would find her some help. Luckily there are outlets behind the church so we might rig something up. But then the church people might get upset.
10ei5ij,j4sg56q,,Truly heart breaking
10ei5ij,j4td1jb,,can a church put her up ina hotel for a while. my freinds from states away flipped out and made me stay with them for a while. i went to a few retreats saw some family. it was a tough but i guess a time i needed. i bought a electric blanket and got my 20 pound weighted blanket and rested in bed with water and food for three or four days. i walked or tried to. too weak. i left thehostpial last month stronger and my stomach is feeling ok. the pain i am in started to confine me to bed and the car is painful to sleep in or due long drives.   i heard from housing authority they pulled my application for approval certification of housing because the landlord wont stop givng me negative reviews. they found out thru case mgmt im paying and case mgmt is paying application fees and being rejected for housing.   please help her and thank you for doing all this. im thankful to my frens for helping me theres no  next of kin for a lot of homeless pple.   can case mgmt help her in anyway? case mgmt is found thru doctotrs offices.
10ei5ij,,j4tg0fx,I have to look into it. I know she has a case manager for the EBT. Ive seen the paper work. I just dont know what role they serve.
10ei5ij,,j4v2nj5,Oh good. They have funds that can place herbin a hotel for a while. What about Catholic women's shelters? They'd take her in and help her. You are a wonderful beautiful caring soul. My friends took me in for while. Thank u for helping her u are saving her life. She'll be back on her feet.
10ei5ij,,j4v36m6,Case mgmt can locate housing provide food, supplies varied services. asking for every option. Cool works.com was in a thread here jobs that provide housing. But no everyone can work. I m certain things work out

10ei5ij,j50ioxi,,Do you think she's competent enough to do tax filing? She could be an independent contract accountant between the tax seasons, and with that she could establish her own company that she could use to obtain a home and vehicle with. She could use that to obtain whole life insurance so when she is unable to work, she'll have that to provide for her. As well as, she could hire people to work for her company and live off that income as well.
10ei5ij,,j50p2kp,I doubt she knows anything about taxes. I'm also not sure anyone would take their taxes to a homeless person.
10ei5ij,,j50rg5a,There's a course you have to take, and H&R Block trains people all the time, you could probably help her get a job there through your local govt employment office (we have Dept of Economic Security in Arizona). You just put up two imaginary obstacles for this woman you say you're trying to help, and I removed one before you dreamed of it. Maybe she could get a job at a local library reading to children's groups. How much is your help helping this woman versus helping your image?
10ei5ij,j4sonnk,,This might seem like a crazy option. Can she speak? How are her speaking skills?

10ei5ij,,j4t0hc7,Yes she can speak. Very lucid and articulate. She has tons of notebooks she writes in everyday. She has no income other than the EBT card. I have a wife and 3 kids and bringing her in would cause a lot of unwanted drama. So for now Im trying to find her a place.

There's alot of apartmen complxes that are 600+ for rent, trailer and rv parks, and houses for rent in both counties  There's alot of businesses around here, small and corporate, that always seem like they're hiring.

10e45bh,,j4t7nd7,Restaurants generally don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre trans, queer, gay, NB, a felon with a rap sheet or have tattoos all over your face to be a dishie.

I used to think that certain states were better for being homeless or that the liberal states were better but now I think it's more of a local thing where you just have to stumble onto some random city where everyone happens to be in a great mood that day and it's nice and sunny outside, etc.
10e277m,j4qrhz1,,It's true there is no good place to be homeless. There is no place that ushers everyone into a free apartment or has a set up of services easy and accessible to all. Generous handouts of everything you need. If you are disabled, you need to concentrate on getting disability payments and housing. If you read from other people's posts here, the people lacking jobs report abject misery. Wandering around cold and hungry and unshowered. At least look into states where it's not as cold and who let you get food stamps consistently , states lacking work requirements. If you really believe you're going to be evicted, which is what it seems like. Ask in the food stamp sub about your state. Might be best to start there. You should have food stamps now.

The wierd thing is, I was born and raised in a very liberal/progressive blue area but it's almost 1,000 miles from here.  I'm not currenly on any housing lists because I don't want to live here if I become homeless.  I've watched sooo many videos about various people, organizations and Churches helping the homeless. Also, just random strangers walking up to homeless people and giving them clothes, food, money, etc. Even families taking thier kids out on the streets to give the homeless food (kind of like teaching your kids about civics/humanity or something). I hope it's really like that out there but I still feel like most of this stuff happens on the west coast.

There's only so much to do on your laptop or phone besides apply to jobs and look at feeds. Reading, writing, and drawing are essentially free hobbies though. So is walking.  * Fast food is stupidly cheap if you do it right. I can get entire meals for $2. Grocery stores are getting absurdly expensive (except Trader Joe's).   * A car is safety and security. Shelters are not. Shelters may protect you from the elements but they also push into groups of people who are not as mentally stable as you.   * Public transportation is amazingly affordable and convenient. Metro Bike Share is underutilized by most of the population even though it's the best form of transportation in downtown.   * Rent is a leash. I'm saving $25,000/year by not having an apartment. I will actually be able to save up more money than a lot of other people in the city *because* I can't afford an apartment, and by working half as many hours.  * Nothing helps more than a good friend. They can offer a couch, a cup of coffee, a shower, a floor, or even just quality time. Distractions are essential, which is one reason I think alcohol and drug use is so high. We need an escape, and vices are quick and easy.  * Anyone who has never spent a night on the street has no idea the destruction it does to a person's psyche. It exponentially destroys a person's mental health. If we passed a law that required every person to spend 1 night on the street when they turn 18, everyone would vote against it as inhumane, but we don't seem to mind letting the most vulnerable people in society suffer it daily.  * You wouldn't recognize a lot of homeless people because they hide it very well. The obvious ones become the stereotype.
10e1ye6,,j4otihq,thank you this helped so much
10e1ye6,,j4pdld9,Yeah you scored op - in particular the last 2 sentences imo .  Btw I'm in Vancouver Canada and the biggest dif I see is better shelters here.  Here they are seperated into low barrier/ high barrier, and the high barrier ones are very safe, but probably less strict than us shelters. I read about a low barrier shelter in Denver and it sounds similar to high barrier Here   You just can't use on site or puke and pass out everywhere.  Some grumpy staff will roll their eyes and stuff if you're drunk or on hard drugs, but that's about it.  Well some staff are cold in general to the point of creepiness no matter what you do, but most are ok.
10e1ye6,,j4pfsce,Oh I forgot the worst thing about the high barrier shelters here is no bikes, you have to lock outside in a dodgy area  overnight and hope you don't get your lock cut.  I lost 3 bikes in 6 months for 2.5 k loss, then have to listen to NIMBYS assume any hobo with a nice bike must have a stolen one   Here is the first one lost, had it 18 months. https://i.ibb.co/kM349C3/IMG-0610.jpg    But the full on  druggie shelters have bike rooms.
10e1ye6,j4q0xjw,,Forget sleeping safe.thats fuckin history and not within months of work to get.  I just want to know where to sleep without jailtime.  Jail means a charge, a court date, and probably you getting fucked at your job or the background check for the next one.  Shelters that close doors from 7 am to 6 pm and don't let you in after 7 aren't much help either without a car.  You get trapped and then you spend months to years to decades being a bum. Being poor enough to need sleep without a home makes you a criminal.
10e1ye6,j4pf94b,,Oh debate!  Can you give us transcript or audio/video?
10e1ig2,j4ogw1o,,Are you comparing rent to a mobile phone bill?  If someone can afford one, then they should be able to afford the other?  Additionally, there is the Lifeline service that some will qualify for.    Wifi can be good for data and is available lots of places.
10e1ig2,j4ogjr9,,How do you?
10e1ig2,j4pftpc,,Free, government subsidized cell phones.  https://www.freegovernmentcellphones.net/
10e1ig2,j4oto20,,"How do homeless people afford $30 cell phone bills but not $1500 apartments?"  That's what you sound like.
10e1ig2,j4oj90a,,I got my phone before I became homeless and I have free talk/text/data with QLink. Many people donate unlocked phones that can be used with the free SIM card. Otherwise, people on various "Obamaphone" plans can pay $50ish for a phone.   Everyone donates plasma and the majority of the people in this shelter either work or get disability or are retired.
10e1ig2,j4pcwmc,,I had my phone before becoming homeless and only payed $15 a month with mint mobile.    Much less than the minimum of $500 for rent.    Just because a homeless person has a phone does not mean they can afford a home.
10e1ig2,j4q7wd8,,Prepaid phone at Walmart, cost me 39.99. And I use free public wifi whenever I can. I have an app called textnow which allows me to make calls and texts for free whenever I'm on wifi
10e1ig2,j4p3ngu,,Phones I can get from nice Gfs, sometimes family or friends. You can get Walmart prepaid shit or find it cheaper in other places. Or sometimes I don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore and will just catch up any time I find free wifi.
10e1ig2,j4om39w,,Cheap phone is ~$100-$200  Pay as you go plan is ~$30 for a month of service  Rent in a narcissist's basement is ~$700-$1000 for a month  Rent in a highrise is ~$1500-$2000 for a month and you're vetted to hell and back  Most places give government assistance, where I live it's ~$400 basic needs portion, ~$400 housing portion   Canadian dollars in my case, amounts vary based on location  Does this answer your question?   Also, I don't know how anyone could do a job hunt, a housing hunt, and do their basic errands without a cell in this day and age.
10e1ig2,,j4oobhm,legit cheap phone is 100 - but many homeless go to the 'flea markets' next to the dealers. ;)
10e1ig2,,j4oof8b,Can easily get an after market phone for $20-$50, or free from a friend, ya
10e1ig2,,j4oslig,I think more people would donate old phones if they knew homeless could use them for wifi
10e1ig2,,j4othlf,Do most people not understand public wifi exists? Idk I think it takes a truly ignorant person to not understand why a homeless person might want a cellphone, or to think we are utterly incapable of getting hold of one.  Same people might say "jus git a jawb" while being baffled that you managed to get a subway sandwich. Like I know people really are this ignorant but damn it's just somehow hard to believe that they're the ones that manage to keep their life together somehow.
10e1ig2,,j4ov9w2,Sadly you nailed it. They think we are too dumb to find and watch YouTube vids And then assume we have job opportunities coming out of our arses.
10e1ig2,,j4owifl,Mann I'm tired of hearing this "nobody wants to work" shit  Nobody seems that eager to hire me
10e1ig2,,j4oyb2w,My stepmom used to blast dr Laura 3 hours a day and I never heard the end of it
10e1ig2,j4onj99,,I just use wifi and a wifi to sms app 90% of the time. - but I could hook up for 15 dollars a month with cellular and a bit of data  if I really wanted to.  When I do hook up I usually end up losing the phone within a couple months,  and prefer laptops anyway - the phone is a luxury.
10e1ig2,,j4ralgh,Whats a good app with free phone service and allows for sms verification?
10e1ig2,,j4rbl2j,I don't think I've ever verified through wifi :(  Haven't tried much,gave up easy -  and not being able to check my bank balance or unlock my stupid Gmail is about the only reason I'd pay for cellular.  Oh, if I'm tenting it the hotspot is nice
10e1ig2,j4p1eah,,Mint mobile three month plans for 75 bucks csm in a pinch when I was looking for jobs.
10e1ig2,j4p21gg,,Homeless on and off for the last 10 years. Since im disabled my family pays for my phone and bill.
10e1ig2,j4sy9lx,,My aunt let me join her plan so that I wouldn‚Äôt have a bill anymore. Verizon was ruining my life (and that‚Äôs saying something).
10e1ig2,j4t5vwn,,Bought a phone in November 2020, bought an otter box for it. Paid $400, from my stimulus money, and got a 5G phone. Before that I always had cheap phones that died pretty quick. I *share* this phone with my boo, so it's two people. Without this phone, I would be missing a large portion of my income. As for internet access, we are on my mom's plan. It's $40 a month. I was paying but stopped in August because food is getting so expensive. Mom picked up the tab, but she is keeping tabs and it is considered a loan. It's the only family help either of us have.
10e1ig2,j4yohew,,Some of us  Work with mobile apps . Uber eats .dd   Some of us have actually  jobs. Which Honestly  is frustrating  because  in most cases .disqualify  of of some programs.
10e1ig2,j4pk7tv,,How did you access reddit?
10e1ig2,j4puuoy,,You do realize a lot of homeless people have jobs to pay for certain luxuries, correct?
10e1ig2,j4qw4m5,,Free phone from the government, probably had a phone before most of us became homeless. Prepaid carriers don‚Äôt check your credit, apartments complexes do. People who ask this, need too open an internet browser
10e1ig2,j4oo9nb,,There's the lifeline program. You can either get a landline (or internet) or a cellphone/tablet. The cellphone/tablet will come with a little bit of data, and the cell will come with minutes as well. It used to be just a little bit of internet, and a limited amount of minutes, but that could have changed since I last got one. Either way, there is no cost, except maybe a small nominal "upgrade" fee for getting a better quality device. Service is free, although you have the option  of adding additional data/minutes through qualified providers. Also, if you live where free data is provided, you can use that data service with the device to extend the data that comes with the device already. Libraries are a good source for free data.
10e1ig2,j4rae6o,,Magic... in an era of 20 dollar smart phones and 15 dollar a month service and wifi everywhere. Total enigma, how do they do it?
10duoxp,j4oxc22,,Thank you for this! Me and my mother use Del Taco since we live in our car right now and this would really help cut our expenses down a lot (since eating out isn't cheap and we don't have a kitchen to cook)!
10duoxp,j4oo42v,,In parts of California you can buy Del taco with EBT/Snap benefits fyi
10duoxp,,j4oozna,I just applied for Cal Fresh yesterday and was very happy to see them under the restaurant option (which applies if you're homeless).
10duoxp,,j4ooz97,Good for the people with those cards :)
10duoxp,j4p8lm9,,Man when I was homeless i didn't even have ID let alone a credit card lol.
10dsa82,j4odjsg,,Make lists üíï It helps me calm and make sure I have all my basic things accounted for.  Just start üíï It's so overwhelming. I was wracked with panic attacks today to the point of tears. Finally after a few breakdowns, I started a load of laundry and that helped me keep rolling.  I don't know it all. I just know what works for me. Much love
10dsa82,,j4oeagx,Thank you, for taking the time to reach out. I have been working on cutting out the negative habits (smoking, biting my nails, etc.) But I should also be creating positive habits in the process. Note taking is a very useful tool, one I underutilize. Again thank you, for your time and consideration. üôè
10dsa82,,j4of2x7,Absolutely!  I've been trying to start each day with "miracle mornings" SAVERS:  Silence - meditate on today's intentions.  Affirmations - "I am working actively towards my ____ by doing XYZ ____."  Visualize - see yourself not only achieving your goals, but also doing the mundane things that will grind you towards them.  Exercise - get some sun, do some good!  Read - educate yourself on a topic you want to master.  Scribe - journal.  Edited for readability hopefully
10dsa82,j4zo9jp,,Same. But in northern Idaho/ eastern Washington (not Seattle. Not even fucking close)
10dha4q,j4lrzyo,,Cool you found some shelter. Just be careful going in and out, find out if the room is actively used by janitorial staff before you commit to sleeping and stuff if you can.  It would be cool if there's running water, you could wash up. Looks like a sink in the picture maybe. If there is don't just assume it's safe to drink though. Check if water is potable before drinking. Stay safe & hang in there.
10dha4q,,j4ltgfc,I've been in that area but in a way more visible spot. I got lucky door requiring keycard just opened. It's doubtful I'll have consistent access to this particular room. But yup they got working sink which I used. Been sleeping outside that door which is tucked away from hallway so nice nook for a week. Been fine leaving at 7am. Appreciate it and wishing you well too.
10dha4q,,j4ots6s,Stay blessed.
10dha4q,,j5qv47d,You too and hope all is well üëç

10dha4q,j4omv3l,,nice. Looks cozy
10dha4q,,j5qvrb1,Thankfully at this point I'm conditioned for whatever, but sure beats outside lol. Lucky found this building because worst case scenario I'd sleep in hallway which is bit colder but still great. Always accessible because hallway door needs to stay unlocked since people come once in awhile to drop off letters, but it's at total opposite end of me and I'm hidden in a nook.
10dha4q,j4qg2eg,,Fucking legend! Enjoy it!
10dha4q,,j5qngn7,Thanks man! It's turned into an urban survival game for me. Crazy that been t this long enough my eyes are always scanning for spots. Pulling at outside doors to office buildings. Finding places to hide.
10dha4q,j4r7f1g,,so....what do you do when the janitor shows up and wants his room back?!
10dha4q,,j5qlbju,I'm gone by that time. In rare case I'm caught I apologize and leave asap. That's all I own so perfect mobile setup.
10dha4q,j4ll2o3,,How long are you going to be homeless?
10dha4q,,j4lmv0q,I truthfully don't know. There's a ton of factors. There's certain things I'm waiting on to reveal which help all this make sense. The story behind all this will absolutely shock everyone I can promise that. The emotional intensity is too much. We've all got amazing life experiences and reasonings about all situations. It's timing that counts with everything including duration of homelessness. Sorry to be vague, but there's personal and extremely sensitive issues involved. Thanks for understanding.
10dha4q,,j4o6z2b,this ain't a movie dog
10dha4q,,j4p0mam,Bruh, this person is clearly traumatized. Have some compassion.
10dha4q,,j4obmoy,I agree it's not. It's life. And you have no clue about mine. I chose to show positive as tough as it is. It helps me connect. I had no hobbies before. This gives me another reason to keep living as stuff happens behind the scenes to help. Trust me though my life absolutely could be a movie. Many of us have lives that might as well be told of that caliber. I'm not going to limit myself. What you know here is 5 to 10% of me. In time you'll see that I'm purposely holding back for many reasons. Because if timing is off I might never get out of this.
10dha4q,,j4oxerz,I left Argentina back in 2015 when I was 23, hitched my way through South, Central and North America, ended up in Oregon working in the weed business.  Man, so many stories. Bet you can make a nice little movie out of some of them. A short film for sure LOL.   Be well brother. Hope you're good and *doing good.*
10dha4q,,j5quohe,Damn that's quite the trip! Where you at now? Did I tell you I'm from Oregon lol? Spent vast majority of my life there. For sure could make awesome media in an format especially considering how much idiotic stuff gets shown. The difficulty is there is so much to decipher and sort through. Plus presentation. Appreciate it and you as well. There's always a method behind the madness. Trust me üëç
10dha4q,,j5sfxco,I am currently housed and living in between Rogue River and Grants Pass. Trimming weed. The winters can be rough although not as rough as some places but I love southern Oregon. It can be lonely but I dig it. I thrive on loneliness.
10dha4q,,j4r75ag,If you turn out to be the long lost prodigal prince son of King Mohammed and you want your princess , look me up!
10dha4q,,j5qlzzm,Lol. I'm Moroccan descent and King Mohammed is the ruler there. Sure tell me how to look you up and we'll see. Although just being a prince is super tame compared to what I'm talking about.
10dha4q,,j4ox9k3,This is whatever you want it to be. Beauty of life. Most of us are crippled by the system but the few things we do get to decide make our life.
10db91k,j4kk2yw,,I was sleeping on the streets last summer... I've got to say this is brave of you. I have schizophrenia and adjusting to a bed, even a hotel bed for a night, was a bit of a jarring change for me. Please stay safe.
10db91k,,j4kkcwb,I'm not worried about anything bad happening. I'm a decent judge of character plus when I do this I don't ever bring anything of value with me. Thank you though üôå
10db91k,j4l4ewx,,He's a good man, and thorough.
10db91k,,j4nverp,Whoa that?
10db91k,j4kl731,,I appreciate you extending this out to strangers on the internet. I'm currently housed but losing my spot at the end of the month. I'm picky about who I allow into my space, but I've let a few folks come in to shower, get warm and nap if they want. I do outreach here so a lot of my local homeless neighbors have gotten to know me, and I'm glad for everyone else I haven't been able to or didn't feel comfortable bringing in, I can still be a source for help in this town that seems so intent on being cruel.
10db91k,,j4kldc7,What towns that?
10db91k,,j4klv2y,I don't give my exact location, but it's the northwest part of Missouri. They recently passed a law that makes camping a misdemeanor, as well as restricts state funding so that it never goes towards long term housing. We have no year round shelter here, and the cold weather shelter only is allowed to open their doors when Temps hit 20 f or lower in any given night.  Whole ass abandoned hotel right downtown, yet the options for shelter are disturbing here. Only 4 women get a limited hotel room, and they must call at exactly 9am and hope the one person answering phones picks up theirs, only 4.  For the men, if you're not disabled or a veteran, you're on your own regardless. If you are disabled or a veteran, you must have income or proof you're close to getting stable income, then your option is to pay a third of that income to share a single room. I was presented that option, but a lot of the guys who stay there drink a lot, and it costs the same for this one bedroom apartment I only had to wait like another month for.  It's fucked up for real
10db91k,,j4kva5p,Yea I'm from Philadelphia so I understand how bad that shit is
10db91k,,j4kvqpy,I don't know that I intend to stay for too long after I lose my spot, got a couple options out of this state and it seems like that'd be the smart thing to do
10db91k,,j4kxwsa,Best bet ,if you frequent the unsteadiness of housing like I do, is to find some where that has awesome resources for the homeless. Cincinnati has the super long wait for housing but they have a slu of organizations that come around and hand out heater meals and case management.
10db91k,,j4l0ibd,I don't know how much longer I even wanna do any of this anymore. But I got some farm work opportunities in exchange for room and board in Oregon that I'm probably gonna do, figure my shit out as I go. I've been to 146 cities in two years time, I'm not considered valuable enough to exploit because I have limitations to what work I can do. None of the jobs I've applied to have called back so, I'm giving up on a lot
10db91k,,j4nv8rv,I wouldn't say that you're not valuable enough to exploit I think it's that you're valuable enough that you don't exploit.
10db91k,j4obnj0,,I honestly can't believe that no one has messaged me or anything
10d9aj8,j4kblnh,,I am in the boat you're going to be in. Get a membership to Planet Fitness so you can take a shower. That is like the number one thing you get stinky quick. I still haven't got a windshield visor although I really wish I had one especially right now because there's all kinds of people walking by looking at me and it makes a little hard to go to sleep. So definitely getting one of those is a must. After that it's all finding good places to park to sleep. If there's truck stops around you those are good some Walmarts will let you park in the parking lot even some gas stations it all kind of depends on your part of the country. If you have insurance on your car or at least can get it I would definitely do something like ubereats to get a little money. And that's really all you need at least all I can think of. This is the second time I've been homeless in my life and the first time was just out sleeping on the streets and then shelters and car homeless is 5 million times better.  I'm just winging it though so it's not like I'm an expert if you run into any good ideas feel free to let me know.
10d9aj8,,j4on5bu,how should i turn my life around and become successful
10d9aj8,,j4ooj1h,Shit I don't know that you're asking the right person man. I still haven't accomplished that. I just got done fucking my whole life off had a job that paid 45,000 a year and apartment, two big ass 65-in TVs, Golden Cadillac, and I quit my job because it was making me want to kill myself and hate my life. Then I maxed out all my credit cards defaulted on $30,000 in credit card debt my stuff is in a storage unit that I'm 14 days late on I'm about a week and a half late on my car payment. Sleeping in my car showering at a gym and doing Uber to make money. I have applied to get CDL school paid for so if that gets approved things should start looking up. The only advice I could give is to work everyday because once I stopped working that's when my life started going to shit.
10d9aj8,j4kiw76,,I‚Äôve never slept in a car but make sure to note where all public toilets are and public showers.   If you‚Äôre a woman (nobody talks about this much!) take whatever tissues, napkins toilet paper rolls etc you can find for free to use as pads for your period.   I‚Äôd say make sure your doors are locked and if you don‚Äôt put any valuables in sight most people will not bother you I hope. Blanket‚Äôs definitely draw suspicion.   And look for anything you can to for some quick money. Uber eats is a good one I‚Äôve heard, selling things you can make, or anything really.   Good luck! You‚Äôll get though it
10d9aj8,j4kfwov,,I would suggest getting a cheap disposable dehumidifier, maybe even grab a few they are really cheap.

10d9aj8,,j4mmydd,I just watched a video from one of my favorite stealth campers and he talked about this problem today, the condensation thing. I also deal with it when winter car camping. There are two tips for you. If you're in an area that is warm enough at night, you can theoretically crack a window or sunroof.  HOWEVER  Evidently you can buy little tubs of those desiccant salts (you know, the stuff in the little packets inside medicine or things you buy online that say "do not eat") at the Dollar Store. I haven't tested it, but he seemed to think they worked and he has a Forerunner.  Edit - also, if you are a woman, I discovered that inside of the Apple Stores in my area, if you use the family restroom or the gender neutral ones, they provide free tampons and pads. Something I noted in my journal in the event I ever needed to help someone with this factoid, like now ü§ì

It doesn't have to be cash and they don't have to be homeless .  Your better off than most in that you have a car . Having a place to put your belongings while you look for work and go to work is a big advantage.  Try caring all your belongings and asking to fill out a application . Good luck
10d9aj8,j4n3ixx,,With a car, you already have a couple of job prospects. Uber eats or DoorDash?

10d9aj8,,j4kc5uo,I'm in the LA area. Had to deal with racism, car getting towed, no money for gas, people vandalizing my car. Did I mention I have no boyfriend and I'm Black and gay and homeless. Today is my 32nd birthday and I have no money
10d9aj8,,j4kcf2c,I‚Äôm so sorry. This world can be very cruel
10d9aj8,,j4kcqeu,It can. Thank you. I feel it doesn't help stuff like, "I don't have the balls to commit suicide" gets thrown aroundm why do people say that? When suicide is supposed to be a bad thing, but clearly not when people throw around shit like that etc. I'm banned from r/suicidewatch, but they were unhelpful anyways.
10d9aj8,,j4mntbz,37m/gay dude here, man. Up in Seattle. Dodged a few bullets but have been teetering on the brink of homelessness for a while; things seem to have stabilized a bit, but my mental health is still so so so fuck that....yeah. It sucks because as gay men, it's true that no one really does give two shits about us. I'm not a POC, and so I can only imagine how much harder that makes everything, especially in a place like LA. I don't have a lot to offer but if you need to vent....
10d9aj8,,j4myehv,Thank you. It's my 32nd birthday today too lol. I had to deal with homophobia/racism, maybe a mix of both, in a past group I was in. Because I live in my car, and they would never talk to me, or want to hear my story. But it is what it is. I think it's because they assume gay men to be wealthy and ritzy and flashy, so a gay homeless guy is an ultimate confusion mindful. Just my theory. Etc.   It's just awful.
10d9aj8,,j4n48bj,I get that, minus the racism of course, being what I am. It fucking sucks. Up here, the vast majority of the gays all live in their little white tech money bubbles and the moment they figure out I'm not that, they get mad and then disappear. Like "how dare you look exactly like us yet not be us?!" I don't drink anymore as I have pretty severe bipolar 2, it turns out, and I've had to get totally sober - no weed, nothing - on top of taking meds and stuff, and I have to start doing the lifestyle changes, too and it just...if you don't fit the exact mold that is created for us, there's *no one.* The only reason I'm not homeless is because I have one close friend who went through a lot of the stuff I have been through, and is letting me rent a room from him. My birthday was last month, and I spent it entirely alone. I didn't even hear from what little family I have, and only my roommate remembered, because his birthday is the day after mine. Christmas was even worse.  I wish I could help more. I did tell someone else on this sub, though, someone also struggling with bipolar disorder, that sometimes a good start towards getting the companionship need met is getting around other people with similar struggles. I'm trying to do that. It's a slow process, but it's something, at least. Do you work?
10d9aj8,,j4llkh2,Why does u being gay matter lol‚Ä¶. Matter fact its much easier to be gay cuz dudes are super easy to deal with üòÇ being a single homeless man trying to attract a woman is much harder.
10d9aj8,,j4mxg47,I think street life is just homophobic. I see your point, but it's hard enough being gay and making friends networking in general, but trying to form connections on the street as a gay vagabond, seems more difficult but I don't know why people downvoted you like that, as I respect your opinion.
10d9aj8,,j5439y4,That‚Äôs a totally wrong assumption‚Ä¶he‚Äôs got two things working against him‚Ä¶both POC and LGBTQ have been hated for centuries. But yes I‚Äôm sure being a straight white guy is hard enough for you

Also download fast food apps. Some franchise will give you free food/drinks when you sign up. McDonald‚Äôs has sometimes free breakfast meals and 99 cents coffee drinks hot/cold per day and expires end of 2023. And enter your bday cause you can get free big meals like at Dennys, McDonald‚Äôs, etc. If you like to drink coffee get the Starbucks app. You get points when you buy stuff there. And redeem points to get free food or drinks.   Showers: I recommend Planet Fitness. $10 a month for basic or get the black card to get free chair or bed massages if you like. Also if you can afford it.   Gas: download Upside app. Whichever gas station participates Upside, you get money back when you pump gas. After it reaches $10, you can deposit into your bank account.   Quicks jobs: applied to fast food places or retail stores. I know fast food places like firehouse subs adds tips while working part time.   Rest areas/Bathrooms: I recommend Love‚Äôs, Quick trip (QT for short), Pilots/Flying J. Don‚Äôt park where it says 1hour parking limit. I noticed now some Love‚Äôs are now giving ‚Äúfinal warning yellow paper‚Äù on cars by 7am. That‚Äôs when traffic starts coming in. But then again it‚Äôs the GM wanting to be an asshole cause it‚Äôs the new year, everyone is done with vacation and going back to work.   I hope this helps. Any tips please do share. Take care and I‚Äôm praying for you that all goes well with you. I know it‚Äôs tough, but this hard time shall pass. Any questions please ask :)
10d9aj8,,j4topw2,Thank you. Everyone around me keeps saying that I‚Äôm stupid for what I‚Äôm doing and I shouldn‚Äôt be living in my car. I almost feel like this is what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing. Like I‚Äôm going in the right direction in my life. I‚Äôm currently laying in my car in a hotel parking lot. It‚Äôs very windy and it‚Äôs rocking my car but I‚Äôm very snug and warm under my blankets. Not sure if I‚Äôll sleep though; I already have trouble sleeping and plus it‚Äôs kind of unsettling being outside like this.
10d9aj8,,j4uqsqe,I don't know if you have heard of this organization that helps homeless people with pets. You can look up free pet food places and you can call them for dog crates and free vet care. They are in Nevada but help all over U.S. and parts of Canada. If you need to call them remember the time difference. They are open M-F 9-3pm I would call around 1-4pm my time in boston. Hope you can find some help from their resources.   https://petsofthehomeless.org/
10d9aj8,,j4urh5i,You‚Äôre welcome and Thank you! I‚Äôll look into it. I‚Äôm in Georgia temporarily. Planning to get out of Georgia after February. Just saving up money to leave this damn place. Georgia is not a place for the homeless and the resources are horrible here. Beware of Georgia.
10d9aj8,,j4urtyg,Thank you. I finally got housing after 4 years of living in a shelter apartment with other moms and kids. It was not easy living with strangers but we got through it and am now in a 3 bedroom with my kids. Hope you can find someplace else to live. I am in MA near Boston and they have pretty good resources here. Good Luck.
10d9aj8,,j4ut2x8,Yay congratulations! That‚Äôs awesome! As they say patience is a virtue. Tbh I did hate being patient but I learned to value it. We are planning to go to NJ to be close to NY. Rent control in NJ and affordable as well. Plus my fianc√© can now find jobs that are higher pay than here in GA. I work remotely and thank God they understand my situation and gave me a laptop to still work. Thanks for the tip for Boston. I‚Äôll look into it as well. Have a great 2023!
10d9aj8,,j4utfk8,Yes you have to have lots and lots of patience. I thought I would never get indoors again. It was scary. I am hoping and praying things get better for all of you and that 2023 is better for you. So happy you can do your work remotely that must be a God send. Hoping everything works for you.

10d7787,,j4k4gch,She doesn‚Äôt know how to handle how other people are . She said that because I said she never loved me and didn‚Äôt want me . She essentially proved I was right. It is what it is tho. I won‚Äôt be homeless forever and I‚Äôll have a good career. Unlike her
10d7787,,j4l35tt,Ignore her. Stay at her house to sleep. You can't hear insults when you are sleeping. It will be much better for you to stay at your mom's house for sleep. Millions of people hear abusive things. You aren't special for that. Be sensible. Ignore the insults and sleep at your mom's house.

10d2b3k,j4jigh9,,DV agencies may have more options for you.
10d2b3k,,j4jzkcj,Only if there‚Äôs documented proof she‚Äôs a victim of DV.  At least that‚Äôs how DV programs are around me - very selective since they can only take a much smaller amount of clients, and you need proof (police reports, court documents, OPs, etc.).
10d2b3k,,j4jzozu,In California, that is illegal. The state funding for DV shelters prohibits requiring documentation.

10d2b3k,,j4k5cx2,That's the strangest thing. Jesus judged the Pharisees for them telling people to get healed on any other day but Sabbath (Luke 13:14). A public holiday is a man-made Sabbath, not even holy.  Between getting 1st degree burns from the shower at the Sarasota shelter, and receiving a backpack with the label "Southwest Waste" at the one in Fort Myers, these folk really tempting God to anger.

10d2b3k,,j4oss0f,If possible you could try moving to LA, its right next door to you and they have many more shelters available
10d2b3k,,j4ostzz,Something I‚Äôve considered but the rents there aren‚Äôt much better.
10d2b3k,,j4ou7sl,Well but you could live in a shelter in LA. Once you're back on your feet/earning more money, you can then start looking at renting a place. There's some places in the San Fernando Valley for like $1,400/month, which is a bit better than OC I think
10d2b3k,j4jc5k8,,Check out r/assistance and the sidebar on the right for resources.  I don't really have ideas......I mean $4,500 a month?!  Minimum????  Realistically, I think you'd need like 8 roommates and pay about $600 each in rent.  I don't think that's possible........   EDIT:  can you appeal the decision at the shelter?  I mean it sounds like the worker made a mistake - it does happen - and you were relying on that so... can the shelter correct it?
10d2b3k,,j4jfzag,No, there is no appeal process at all.   And thank you for your suggestion. I have posted on r/Assistance for advice.
10d2b3k,,j4mupfk,That‚Äôs because landlords often require you to prove that you make 3x the rent, even though most people don‚Äôt. Then you need first, last and security deposits.

10d2b3k,j4mvhlj,,The best I can suggest is looking for a roommate situation. Many parents are sharing houses/apartments, often by choice and co-raising their kids, but either way there‚Äôs no shame in sharing a place with other adults and/or kids. If you can afford a motel for a week it would give you time to find something. Are you in any parents groups? Maybe start there.   Another option if you have a car or can afford some upfront costs for a van is to live in it. Check out cheapRVliving.com for help getting started and living well in a vehicle. There are many thousands of Americans living in vehicles and it‚Äôs a lot better than shelters in most ways.   You can also try renting a room on Airbnb for a week or month to give you time to figure things out. At least then you would be able to cook and sleep whereas motel cooking can be a real pain.

10d1jc2,,j4mcmdt,I was renovating the house my ex-wife and I bought and everything went wrong. It was incredibly stressful and unfulfilling- months of work for essentially nothing since she would live there and I would not.

10cyewx,j4jry9z,,I live in San Jose, CA (near SF) and am indoors now but I used to be on the street here. It is **nothing** like your description in your OP. Yes we have expanded Medicaid here (it‚Äôs called Medi-cal) but no one is handing out free motel rooms, in fact we have the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless in the country (78%). The cops are NOT chill and the normies have lost all sympathy for us. The cost of living is one of the highest in the country, it is nearly impossible to get an apartment of any size for under $2000 a month. And that‚Äôs an income restricted apartment in the ghetto.   It‚Äôs not a **bad** place to be necessarily, it‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre here, but it‚Äôs nothing fancy or special. I don‚Äôt see any reason for anyone to move here to be homeless.
10cyewx,j4irm8k,,I keep a low profile. I do my best to not interact with people and avoid confrontation. It's not that hard to survive being homeless in the most wealthiest country on earth, unless you have an addiction or other major issues. And tbh, even as bums, we're fucking spoiled.
10cyewx,,j4itdgg,Hey, thanks for your reply!. A few questions though if you don't mind. How do you avoid confrontation?. Like your just sitting there minding your own business and suddenly some really buff tweaker dude walks up and starts demanding drugs, money or whatever and you don't have anything and the guy wants to fight you. I mean, do you just smile at him and hope he goes away or start walking/running away really fast or how do you handle a situation like that?.  Also, what do you mean when you say that you are spoiled?. How are you guys/gals spoiled out there?. Sorry for all the questions but I am genuinely trying to learn the ropes out there because on one hand, it sounds super-dangerous but on the other hand, it kind of sounds pretty awesome tbh.
10cyewx,,j4jj2wy,>Like your just sitting there minding your own business and suddenly some really buff tweaker dude walks up and starts demanding drugs, money or whatever  ü§£ü§£ü§£ Sorry, but it doesn't quite work like that.  They won't try to take your lunch money, but they will harrass, annoy, and antagonize you.  It's best to just avoid them like the plague that they are.  There is no benefit at all in engaging with them.  Their main goal in life is to get high..  It really comes down to plain old knowing how to carry yourself.
10cyewx,,j4iwoh2,Tweakers don't bully. They just act real shady and try to set you up. If they're too friendly just walk away.   And by spoiled I mean there's food everywhere in this country. You just have to put in the work to forage. Right now, I'm surviving with zero dollars and zero resources from the state. I could easy call 211, go to the shelter, and get EBT snap or whatever but I choose not to because I don't need it. Save it for someone else.

10cuf95,j4ihsgs,,If you want to go back, ask around to see what organization can buy you a bus take back. I have read many places to this.
10cuf95,,j4ihvnp,I will look into this
10cuf95,j4iwxnw,,One thought, I hope this can help.  In Seattle we have a small number of programs that work with people in your shoes or similar circumstances - they ended up here and things quickly fell apart and they are now homeless - that will pay for transport back to either their hometown or to a place where they can go to avoid homelessness. We also had this in my hometown, PDX, at least pre-COVID. The services I have connected with here (I was on the edge of homelessness after my ex abandoned me a few months ago) don't just cut a check to you - they vet your background a little and you need to provide them with a contact, normally available by phone, to ensure that when you get where you need to go you have shelter that is not just, like, "hey I'm going to couch surf for a night." I know this isn't great, but it's an idea.   Where is home?
10cuf95,,j4ix5zf,Home is in San Antonio, Texas. It's everything I know. I lived there for 26 years just about my entire life.
10cuf95,,j4izslj,Those programs may even exist down there, too. It sounds like you do have some reliable contacts at home, and they may be able to scrounge around for similar programs.   As an aside, I did some quick googling just now and this is one place in Boulder you may try to connect with:   [https://www.homelesscares.org/programs](https://www.homelesscares.org/programs)  A brief scan of their webpage didn't reveal anything to make me think they're illegitimate, and I got to that page by a link from an article in the Denver paper that I found about federal grants to address homelessness in Denver and Boulder.  You can also try:   [https://www.211colorado.org/](https://www.211colorado.org/)  I just double checked that because I tried to get some assistance back when things were really bad for me this summer and had to reach out to them. I learned that you can dial 211 from basically any phone, even your cell, and it will connect you to a local services line that can then send you on to things like housing, food and transportation services of all sorts, depending of course on what is available in your area.   One thing to remember, dialing 211 will connect you *based on the area code of the phone number from which you are dialing, not the area code where you are physically located*. My phone number is for Portland, OR and so it connected me to the Portland 211 number. When I explained my situation, they then were able to give me the right contact info for the Seattle/King County line. Because you want to get back to San Antonio, if you have a San Antonio area code, you could probably dial 211 and get in touch with them directly and they may even be able to connect you with grant programs there to get you home.
10cuf95,,j4jt8r0,Get to a homeless outreach center. They‚Äôll bus you to San Antonio, as long as someone there will vouch that you have a place to stay with them. I know of one in the Denver area, but I‚Äôm sure boulder has one too.

10cox2e,j4hwfjh,,I fucking feel you brother.  I'm not homeless anymore, but my only real desire is to withdraw from society and live off the land.  Saving for some now, no house, just some land.  Just wanna get a chunk down south where the taxes are like 300 a year and be in the middle of nowhere for no neighbors to complain or building inspectors to hassle.  Just wanna make a fucking hut and live until I die.  Why the fuck are we expected to "accomplish" things?  Let people do big things if they wanna.  Let me and others just watch the world go by if we wanna.  Right now I'm looking at 49 acres in Kentucky for 29K, but I'm 25K away.  When and if I get it, I'll be real happy to let a few people come stay and do whatever the fuck they want on an acre or so of their own.  Not some career people looking for free rent or something, people who don't wanna participate in the system cuz we shouldn't have to.  We should be able to live and grow food and feed ourselves without having to be wrapped up in all the bullshit.

He was basically the alert system (17#), and then I'd run out and the boar would fucking eye me down before deciding I was a hassle.  They could've killed me and my dog, but they're boar and not wolves.  I would post there but move back with your mum is useless advice.  And I'm miserable.  I miss the street but my dog doesn't.

10cox2e,j4hzw38,,You hit the nail on the head. And the reason is that most humans *weren't meant to be free* in the eyes of those who do the fencing and licensing and polluting. They want us to be serfs. End of line.   My only counterpoint is that a) there are still hunter-gatherer and subsistence based cultures that exist in the world, though for most city-dwelling Americans, because we have illusory freedom of movement (the continental US is actually basically a giant cage meant to keep the serfs in), it is impossible or highly infeasible to get to the places where the natural liberties you've correctly identified can be exercised more or less freely - liberties granted to us by the virtue of merely existing and that have similarly been stripped of us by those that see us as serfs. Also b), though this is somewhat tied to a), there are parts of the US where it is feasible to live outside of the constraints of society. Large parts of the Cascade Range in the PNW and the West Coast more generally are home to invisible off the grid people; I've known a vanishingly small number of them, but I have known people that have chosen to just pack their things and go up and live in the woods and that's the end of it. It is incredibly incredibly difficult now to even acquire the skills to be able to live that way - most Americans can't even boil water without burning it because we've effectively criminalized all forms of self-reliance that can't be monetized - but it is possible. This isn't hopeful and it's not a solution. But

10cox2e,,j4rnz5g,RCMP=Royal Canadian Mounted Police, i guess they're kinda like state troopers in America. They're cops of some sort but i don't really know anything else. The rationale was that we were on "Crown Land" which is land owned by the queen of England but almost everything is Crown land in canada, anything that isn't owned by a Canadian citizen is Crown land i think? We weren't on a Canadian citizens property or something and we weren't bothering anyone and we were actually improving the land we were on.

That‚Äôs an extreme solution.** The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value.

10cox2e,j4hfttm,,I don't know. As much as this argument holds true within city, what about outside one? I.e. going full native and choosing to live the rest of your life within the forest the way our ancestors did?     No one will bother to come search for you there. You'd be a as free as the deer running through said forest. You could build your hut, collect berries, drink from streams, etc.      I feel like this argument more pertains to the denial of the right to be free socially. To deny a group of people the right to leave the cities and build there home within the woods alongside each other.     For the government won't bother if it's just you that chooses to go live in the woods. That would be too expensive. But let a small town of homeless choose to build their home in the woods? Oh no, now that's a problem. No taxes are being paid, thus you must be kicked out and forced back into the cities again. Essentially you are denied the right to be happy. Always free to run-away and never be seen again sure, but never alongside a group of people you could call family. We deny people this basic human right to socialize is what we do.     You see this concept even more in homeless encampments. Examples of communities willing to build their own homes and all the infrastructure involved with a neighborhood on a prior worthless piece of land, but are denied the right to because the government simply doesn't want them to have the right to live freely, as then they can't profit off it. After all, there is no money to be made in letting everyone do it themselves, thus we ban people from pouring concrete on the vacant land to build their homes with, even though this is what they will do two months later once they get a construction permit to do it with. Interesting little concept.
10cox2e,,j4hshkp,>going full native and choosing to live the rest of your life within the forest the way our ancestors did?  You can‚Äôt actually do this just anywhere there‚Äôs forest whenever you want. Game-wardens, forest rangers, and conservation officers are very good at their job and have nothing but time and resources to notice poachers. The hunting community also doesn‚Äôt like poachers and will report any traces of people that don‚Äôt belong. It‚Äôs not easy to just ‚Äòlive off the land‚Äô and not get noticed. People are paid to notice.  Edit: typo
10cox2e,,j4i3yf7,Yep. Its either privately owned property or forest land, and you can only camp for two weeks at a time on forest land.
10cox2e,,j4k42ym,If you hunt all year round, which damages the prey population, you will deplete the prey population, as well as the viable crops during the growing and harvesting season. If you hunt between the end of harvest to the beginning of spring, and preserve as much meat as possible, you don't affect the prey population or the viable crops.
10cox2e,,j4i64ty,Idk, I guess I see it differently since I'm in Canada, and 99% of our land is just unpopulated forest and tundra, of which most of it is the Canadian shield that the government wouldn't even be able to put fire watch towers on if they tripled the budget.     Though it raises, its own question. Even if in the U.S. or just barely outside a forest surrounded major city, they've also insured that no one has the skills needed to just go rogue and live as a cavemen for the rest of their days. They've built an education system that purposefully teaches nothing such that you can never be raised learning how to hunt or fish either. They've quite literally killed everyone's ability to just live on the earth in peace.
10cox2e,,j4iegxb,Yes, the school system is based on capitalism. It‚Äôs not meant to teach us survival skills or how to thrive in society, it‚Äôs exists to make rich people richer. It teaches kids to be obedient workers and become part of the system. Consumers.   You‚Äôd be caught living off the land in Canada though. Even in BC and Ontario/Quebec where there‚Äôs land for days they have helicopters doing sweeps. I think you can legally set up camp on crown land for 3 weeks (21 days). I‚Äôve camped that long in the Rockies and didn‚Äôt have any trouble from the Rangers that came by to check on things. But if you were to make a go of it for food and shelter (as a lifestyle) you‚Äôd get caught. Even in Canada.  You can‚Äôt grow anything that quick and hunting would be noticed eventually. Even if you have the skills, realistically, you‚Äôd get caught because of the needs you‚Äôd have as a person living off the grid in the wilderness.
10cox2e,,j4ifd7w,I lived with 8 or so people on a mountain in a forest on an island in Canada it was a 30 minute drive from a town with 100 people and 2 cops that were only around on the weekends iirc and we didn't bother anyone and one day the RCMP came and destroyed everything we had built. I loved on the street from 97 till 03 and learned how to live in a city with no money but i wish I'd been taught how to survive in the bush, i think some of the stuff i learned from being homeless kinda applies to living in the bush but not a lot of it. Yeah it's no wonder people's mental health is bad lately, humans aren't meant to be stressed out all the time. I used to love going to the country man and when we'd return to the city it was awful.
10cox2e,,j4z5o7a,>I.e. going full native and choosing to live the rest of your life within the forest the way our ancestors did?  There is no such thing. All forest is state land, and it is against the law to live on it. If it's private land, it means someone else owns it and is paying and working a job for it.  the couple of exceptions all have extreme weather patterns, no access  to water, cant grow vegetables, etc..  forests have changed. There are many new deadly tick and mosquito diseases that either did not exist, or were rare back when our ancestors lived in forests.  There are also new invasive inedible plants and animal species that have wrecked mosts forests out there and made it harder to survive on.

10cbp2m,j4g2iij,,gas, insurance, maintenance, drivers license, and to get those things you need a home address. It cost about 500 a month. Stationary housing if there is no rent is way cheaper.    I think it‚Äôs a great way to travel, but not a homeless solution.
10cbp2m,,j4gds6s,It's a temporary fix. If the vehicle breaks down you're in worse trouble Especially if you don't have the money to repair it
10cbp2m,,j4jxgy0,Absolutely not. Insurance is the only monthly cost mentioned and will not be even close to rent. I don‚Äôt know where you got as high as $500 a month for insurance costs, or why you think rent costs as low as $500, but no to both of those. Drivers licenses  and maintenance are not monthly costs, they‚Äôre is so infrequent and gas simply does not add enough to bring it even close.  I don‚Äôt think vans will necessarily fix the issue but when I was homeless I lived in a van and used someone else‚Äôs address (who knew) and it was not even comparable to rent at a even a cheap studio apartment.
10cbp2m,,j4mssda,It can be done cheaper, but tags, smog, and it has to be moved or paid parking in a garage all cost money. With food, and cellphone service I figure $500 for a comfortable life, but $250 can be done as well. I‚Äôve seen one person budget as low as $189 a month, but they had free parking And didn‚Äôt need gas money.
10cbp2m,,j4mz29s,Sorry but it‚Äôs still not even close. Tags and registration are annual costs, not monthly costs, food and cellphone are separate expenses that you would still have to add up with rent in a house or apartment. Smog? Are we talking about California? You‚Äôre not finding a place to rent for $500 a month there. New vehicle registration is around $500 depending on county and city for a gas vehicle and that‚Äôs annually, which can be divided by month to about $40 (I used alameda as a reference point). You have a van, you can park wherever. You don‚Äôt voluntarily pick the most expensive place to park and then say it‚Äôs more than rent. Even with a monthly indoor rental, add all of these up and nowhere near close to rent. I don‚Äôt know what else you‚Äôre adding in but the math is off either way. A van is not going to be more expensive than rent itself anywhere.
10cbp2m,,j4ndqck,Sorry if I offended you.
10cbp2m,,j4p3b0c,I‚Äôm not offended I just don‚Äôt get where you‚Äôre getting these numbers from. It doesn‚Äôt add up. If you rent you still have all of the other expenses mentioned, plus rent itself (plus deposit and probably renters insurance). Just moving in will probably cost a couple grand up front. Living in a van is most definitely a way to cut those expenses down. And gives you the freedom to move elsewhere.
10cbp2m,,j4vlgde,Living in a van in the past where you have to move or the cops ticket you. CA though and I have good insurance, Verizon, and no food stamps. Gas is 4-5 a gallon at 9-12 a gallon figure 200 a month. Also laundry, showers at a gym $20 a month. For a decent life it takes some money.On the other hand a paid through medical shelter half way house is free. There are lots of options. Gas is the big thing for a van. I‚Äôve seen people who suffer as low as $250, but it doesn‚Äôt seem sustainable to me. Savings is needed if the van breaks down, oil changes, and basic maintaining cost about $50 a month savings for registration to be added to that. So $450 if you don‚Äôt save any money with food, gas, and basics like soap, laundry, and food.  Question: how much do you think it would cost every month?
10cbp2m,,j4wccqp,Even still that‚Äôs not even close to what rent would be‚Ä¶ Van life is not more expensive than rent which is the part of the comment I was replying to. The problem is you‚Äôre mentioning things that aren‚Äôt housing costs, which you would have anyways, and then calling them housing costs. Most of them not even monthly. If you rent an apartment or house, you still have a food budget, maintenance costs, phone, etc. on top of rent and utilities.   How much it would actually cost would depend on where you are. At one point it costed me $80 for indoor parking in winter and that was my rent, since it was right near work. The gym membership was $10 and some change at planet fitness. So $90 a month in winter, $10 in warm months. A laundromat is like $5 each week. Compare that to rent, *then* add all of the other expenses. Yes I had to get gas and do my oil but it was infrequent, being close to work. And, again, that‚Äôs a normal expense even when you‚Äôre renting or own a home. How do you figure maintenance is going to be $50 a month? You should be saving for emergencies whether you‚Äôre renting or own a home. It‚Äôs not a monthly expense but you should be budgeting for it regardless.   I work full time and I make pretty good money so of course I was saving and not suffering, but I didn‚Äôt add rent into the equation until I had a good chunk saved up. That‚Äôs exactly how I stopped being homeless. OP is just talking about cutting housing expenses out to save money and in my situation, it was the smartest thing to do. Now I have a place, but I still have all of the other expenses you‚Äôre talking about. I have a food budget, I maintain my car, I have a phone and internet bill‚Ä¶ on top of the actual housing cost.   The only place I‚Äôve seen rent being as low as $500 is east Iowa, I was there a few months ago for work. You‚Äôll still have a deposit, utilities and all of the other costs mentioned. And because it‚Äôs a low cost of living area, things are cheaper accordingly, including the annual registration fees, insurance is cheaper, food and gas are cheaper, everything is cheaper and the sales tax is lower than in my state. None of which are housing costs. Van life is not going to be more than rent in any state.
10cbp2m,j4gnwc1,,Lots of homeless people are elderly, disabled, or suffering from mental illness. The lack of certain facilities in van life would be terrible for some of those people. Like, I could walk to a bathroom down the road, but not everyone can make it.

10cbp2m,,j4jp0t5,[deleted]
10cbp2m,,j4kn6it,The government could nationalize them. Simple as that.   They would not be free, you could earn one by qualifying for maximum EBT benefits and being homeless for a year.  Since you would have to recieve maximum EBT benifits for at least a year it would be almost impossible to fake since the gov checks for employment (in case you lie about not having any) they check bank accounts registered in your name, they even check for  unrelated money on Paypal Venmo cash app etc.   So of you want houseing the hard way just be homeless for a year, if you survive
10cbp2m,,j4knbzs,[deleted]
10cbp2m,,j4kqspo,I think youre on the wrong sub buddy.
10cbp2m,j4hkvlh,,Incorrect.     Soviet Block style housing is actually the cheapest way to go if we're just speaking dollar wise.     Of course there are limitations to both. Like the fact that you'd have hundreds of vans lining the streets everywhere if you went with the van option, and that you'd need to be ok with your formerly homeless neighbor having free housing if you went with the soviet block style housing. But just dollar wise, its cheaper and easier to build a couple million units of barren concrete pill boxes, than it is to create a million units worth of Chevy cargo vans and find parking for them.
10cbp2m,j4gkyx5,,That brings a lot limitations into play‚Ä¶interesting line of thinking though with what is most ‚Äòcost effective‚Äô to housing.  Definitely not going to be a one size fits all scenario from the start.

The only thing I hated was that it was rear wheel drive, and without the weight in the back the wheels would spin in the snow. But I had a place to stay close to work. At one point I even found an indoor storage place for $80 a month where I could park and plug in over night. It was perfect, honestly.
10cbp2m,j4guq48,,Down by the river maybe.
10cbp2m,j4hrtcl,,Ive been reading a lot on the housing crisis and it's impact on the economy.theres a few countries who have put their homeless in empty homes which greatly reduced the need for social programs and helped lower prices. The main obvious solution is too build more affordable housing units instead of large single family homes across acers of land.   The biggest shame in all of it is had things like the housing crisis not happened USA gdp would be more than 75% larger.  This is Prosperity being stolen from current and future generations to fill the pockets of greedy landlords who see housing as income or investment instead of a fundamental human right, cooperations who scrounge land in mass quantities, and politicians who are elected to uphold this status quo.
10cbp2m,,j4ihlr1,The only problem I see here is the term: affordable housing. The word 'affordable' is the first barrier to entry, ensuring nobody gets housed.  You need a phone number and address to get a job.
10cbp2m,,j4ipwqd,Yes I think your right there would still be barriers that need to change even if we were to build the millions of houses that are in demand. I myself am having trouble passing everyone's background and credit checks even when I offered some people 6 months or the full years lease in advanced I was turned away. The poor and people who have made some bad financial decisions or had a run in with the law are heavily discriminated against when trying to find a job or home and that needs to change as well.

And it's been liberating for me to come to terms with that, and know that I have nobody to rely on but myself.  I'll never again wonder if people don't want to help me because I'm a bad person.

Why? Because we looked poor. I‚Äôm sorry, I work a lot so on my days off I dress like it‚Äôs laundry day on my days off.

10c3b9w,,j4mlun1,I think you would feel even better attempting change where you can since God will do his will regardless. What about asking to share something at church and when you get the turn to speak you just say "I just want to remind everyone that Jesus was a homeless man."  But then do it every single Sunday. Hobophobia is so wide spread that your church is bound to have some in it's congregations. This would be a good way to elicit small change. Maybe also add proverbs about what you do to the those to the least you do to God. I forget the actual quote but you could say after that ignoring them when they speak to you or discriminating against them in public or as part of your job is no different than doing the same to Jesus himself.  If you made your statement every week it may only enrage the secret hobophobes but it will stick with their children and they will start calling out their parents.
10c3b9w,j4f7r93,,People are often labeled and judged by appearance. No one gets to know anyone. It is sad really. I was homeless and living on the streets for 2 years in freezing cold temperatures.

It took 9 years to get back on my feet and I can truly say that I did it by myself with limited support from so called family and friends. I am not ashamed to cut people off. They were not ashamed to do the same to me so I just return the favor. The feeling is mutual. Do not be angry at doing for yourself. Do not let others selfishness eat at your happiness and peace. Those 9 years were long, but I stayed grateful and humble and now I take nothing for granted. I am glad that you are back on your feet. You go through the worst trauma to become better and it does make you much better for it. Peace my friend.

I will never forget being trapped with no options by the people in power and the multitudes who support them. It will inform my interaction with everyone from here going forward. It will inform how I process all the information I'm given. It will inform my stance toward the order of things as it exists, and my support for things which undermine or ultimately destroy that order.  However, on the flip side, it will also motivate me to try my damnedest not to be like them. Even though I have very little, it will motivate me to be more generous, more helpful to others in need, and to do what I can to make others feel less alone, even if they have issues. It motivates me to at least try and swim against that current.
10c3b9w,j4dzo4e,,I don't ask my friends for money or to sleep in their house, or anything more than I did when I had a home, but I lost quite a few friends when they suddenly got less comfortable now that I was "a homeless person" living in my car.  I'm the same person, dress the same and take roughly the same number of showers, but it's like they suddenly saw me as a scraggly man in stained clothes sitting on the sidewalk about to hassle them for change and treated me accordingly.
10c3b9w,,j4fasjp,You were lucky, you got rid of people that were not your friends.  Better to know now then when years have passed wasted on undeserving people.
10c3b9w,,j4e0zfw,I'm sorry you went through that. You didn't deserve that. They don't know what it's like
10c3b9w,,j4j6ef9,I was heartbroken, crying, and feeling the emotions while reading OP and this comment.   Same thing happened to me when I lived in my SUV for 341 days (Jan 21, 2022 - Dec 28, 2022) after a breakup with an abusive alcoholic broke into someone else's apt while drunk, resulting in both of us getting evicted (of course he didn't display any red flags before I moved in with him!) and then struggled working for many small businesses that left me stressed out and tired all the time, gaining weight and hating myself the most for getting so low‚Äî even suffering COVID during the summer heat and then being let go from a job because the neurotic female owner was scared of getting COVID herself.   The worse feeling was being neglected by my local church and community group that I attended. The few people who I was completely vulnerable with about my situation were always shocked, since my suv is a MB, the previous year I was making good money, and I always dress well. When it first happened, I cried to my pastor on what to do or if there are any families able and willing to take me in as I look for work, but the best he could tell me was to sell my suv, get into an affordable apt, and ride the bus. But at the time I was relying on my suv for earning quick money by delivering for UberEats.   I remember having days of joy, gratitude, drive, and motivation... then [more] days of anger, sadness, self-pity and self-loathing. Anger at the people who say they believe in being like Jesus, but then anger at myself that I got to the point of making others so uncomfortable to do so.   Although I haven't attended church since then, I've kept the faith and im serious when I say only God has been able to provide the miracles that allowed me to get out of that situation and a bad job into a live-in caregiver job. That suv broke down the weekend before Dec 12, 2022 when was fired from my secretary job at an investment firm because they were uncomfortable with my living situation (I had to be honest with them since they wondered why I was in the office on designated work from home days...) and they chalked it up to me "not being a cultural fit."   My anger towards their rejection of me motivated me to really scour Craigslist for room shares which is where I found a "$0 live-in caregiver" opportunity that I knew only God could provide. I still did the work by meeting the person in need of care, and making a good impression to be accepted. The owner of the auto repair shop where my suv went to die (since I didn't have the money for a whole new engine!) felt so bad for me that he freaking bought me a used Honda Odyssey that one of his employees had for sale for $1k.   I share my own personal mini novel because as much as I empathize with the pain of the trauma and stress it is to be homeless: I promised God that I will only get better, not bitter. That I will not become hard-hearted. That I will show compassion and be vulnerable sharing the truth of my situation because although some people reject me out of their own fear or bias: there are others who are compassionate and generous who will take the initiative to help when they become aware. I'm so grateful to both the fearful/selfish and the loving/giving because it brought me to today.   I remind myself, "forgive them, they know not what they do." And that this little chip I now have on my shoulder from this last year motivates me to "live like no one else now (make sacrifices to live well beneath my means), so that later on I can live AND GIVE like no one else!"  Some people are sedated by worldly comforts that it's numbed them of empathy and compassion. I still wouldn't wish them to experience homelessness, especially in isolation. I wish you and everyone here nothing but love and mercy and hope. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πü•∫üíõ
10c3b9w,,j4jftg6,sorry to hear your situation but hopefully it has taught you things as well. we all have to take responsibility for our actions as well (talking general here) because we unfortunately make our own giants at times .  We also have to be self sufficient and realize a lot of people wont or can not lend a helping hand . times have really changed .it amazes me  why more people working do not have some sort of savings account because there is no such thing as job security anymore. all my best!
10c3b9w,j4f52cr,,You're not alone. Idk if I've ever seen anybody else write this out or say it, but I feel it too. It changed how far im willing to go for others, including friends. It changes you when someone you've always considered a solid friend won't even let you crash two nights in between other arrangements or in to take a shower (I understand not everyone can have overnight guests for many various reasons)
10c3b9w,j4h7heq,,Still going through it. Got denied emergency housing in the middle of winter. Because I didn't have $0 in my bank account.  We have a lot of nice people in this society. But they're mixed in with a lot of selfish jerks too.
10c3b9w,j4emgzw,,I was treated like garbage My family members in my father's side  who I don't talk to this day one reached out to me because she was about to be put in a nursing home and I told her nope.
10c3b9w,j4g6tf6,,It made me so miserable and ashamed to even exist. I was treated lesz then human and i started to believe it. I hated people and dont want to let anyone close anymore. I was hurt and discarded by so called friends and strangers teeat me worse why would i want that again. But i need a friend im so lonely and miserable but id rather be lonely and miserable then feel that way again. Its been 2 years and i finaly started leaving the house but itll be awhile still before i try making a friend. It ruined me but i wont let it stop me from living again
10c3b9w,,j4gnvxh,You should get into therapy and begin to rebuild your life.
10c3b9w,,j4hxpzl,Im in therapy. Gonna take few years im sure. But im taking my time and making sure i do everything right.
10c3b9w,,j4i4em2,We don't know each other, but I want to share one of my favorite sayings that has given me, and others, some strength during times it's needed:  You got this.  It don't got you.    I know they're just words, but I truly mean them with all my Being. It'll take time, but healing absolutely will start. And it may build up slowly, but best to be slow than not building up at all. Be gentle with and to yourself. You're a survivor and you have amazing inner strength. You DO. You're still here, after all, and that speaks loudly about the inner strength you possess.
10c3b9w,,j4ic280,Thanks. Appreciate the kind words. Im getting better everyday and i know i got this. Just the post struck home and triggered me to share
10c3b9w,,j4idwf2,I'm glad you're doing better :)
10c3b9w,,j4ij35n,Me too, best of luck to you going forward.
10c3b9w,j4helby,,Oof. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this and sorry you were treated that way. I ended up homeless after leaving a really abusive relationship and then had this absolutely outrageously terrible experience medically so I can relate so much but for me it‚Äôs a lot of the stuff that came before (and I mean I‚Äôm still homeless so I don‚Äôt even know what kind of trauma I‚Äôm eventually going to be processing from this. Lord knows I‚Äôm not in a place to process it yet). I have flashbacks of a lot of the stuff just before or basically as my world was imploding and how effing careless and cruel so many of the places and people everyone would expect to be able to turn for help had been. Maybe you can relate too. Because I don‚Äôt think most of us end up homeless in the first place without being failed by a lot of people and systems.   I got no advice for you obviously. Since I‚Äôm basically living out the same thing. Woke up yesterday to texts from my estranged brother absolutely chewing me up and telling what a shitty person I was and how he‚Äôs so much better, smarter, whatever. Pretty sure he just broke up with his girlfriend and was comparing that breakup to my situation too and I‚Äôm like dude you don‚Äôt even know me (he‚Äôs the one who had stopped talking to me years ago now). Had me just sitting here like with family like that why the flip would I trust or expect anyone else to ever be there for me.  Bah. Sorry to add my own rant to your. But I get it. There‚Äôs even a part of me that wants to point out at least have friends but I get that too- I‚Äôve got a single friend who‚Äôs dealing with a ton of their own crap and not always there but they care and it can be really hard for me to feel it. I suspect once you‚Äôve sunk this low it probably takes at least two good people to every shithead who hurt you. And that feels pretty much impossible or at the very least is going to be one hell of a long healing journey. It ain‚Äôt much- but you‚Äôre at the start of that journey at least. Keep going, keep hanging on. It‚Äôs all we can really do, right?
10c3b9w,j4gido8,,In America you are on your own. Everyone else is only looking out for themselves and family. The systems that are in place to help are only there because of Socialist push back. In upstate NY if it's not 32 Degrees or below you are sleeping in a ditch somewhere that night. If it's that cold you are sleeping on the floor of a community center not knowing if you might die once you close your eyes. We are treated as unpersons and you fall into a cycle of chronic homelessness I will always remember this experience and it will help shape the rest of my life when I get back on my feet I will try to be a voice for the unpersons they need it. It is alright not to forgive society because fuck them I am completely on your side, this experiences show us how people really operate is disgusting and sadly make us sour.
10c3b9w,j4hi642,,Being homeless scarred me for life. I was treated like some kind of plague victim and people were straight cruel at times. All the judgemental people I ran into all the "fake" people that offered help but never made good on any offers and my family who ditched me when I needed help the most and showed me how they really felt about me. I did run into good people at times but in general, I won't forget being mistreated and seeing even worse treatment at times done unto others. You are nothing in society if you are homeless and only a tiny percentage of the populous even cares slightly about you. I saw things that I never thought I would ever see and was traumatized by it.  The US government and state governments hate homeless people as well. Seeing all the anti-homeless measures taken by the city to prevent you from even sitting down disgusts me to my core. Instead of improving overall conditions of life for citizens that have trouble providing they would rather just bar us from all kinds of places so they don't have to "see" us. Even though I'm not homeless now I'm starting to get a lot of anxiety just from typing up my experiences being homeless. The worst place of all though? The local shelter was basically a jail and they people who worked there hated the homeless and acted accordingly.
10c3b9w,j4elqew,,Well damn, I'm right there with you.  In Fort Myers, I passed out from dehydration in front of the homeless services building. So, they called an ambulance... now I'm being charged near a thousand dollars when all I needed was a bottle of water. That's when I realized that the Good Samaritan doesn't exist (parable of man who pays medical bills and hotel stay of a stranger), but I'm pretty sure that's what they still call themselves.  Then, after getting pushed out by churches with No Trespass signs to sleep in the rain, I realized that... wow... Noah would have done the same to you. Love your neighbor as yourself.  I walked from Fort Myers to Tampa for better medical care, praying God show them the same mercy they show to others. Hurricane Ian came a few weeks later, and now I have little sympathy for those who lost everything. Eye for an eye.
10c3b9w,,j4er952,are you still in fort myers? or are you up in tampa?
10c3b9w,,j4ez2vq,Neither. A gym teacher from my high school (20 years ago) invited me to stay with him for a bit. Plan to travel up the east coast once it warms up. I'm interested to report on the resources they have around the State.
10c3b9w,,j4fmfjb,Thank goodness for him and his help. Because of him, I'm positive your future is going to be brighter than you thought it would be a couple months ago.
10c3b9w,,j4etd3r,I no longer feel much sympathy for anyone either. I'm sorry for the things you went through.
10c3b9w,j4fa4cf,,Maybe you need trauma counseling. You can‚Äôt have joy in life if you are angry, depressed and with despise.
10c3b9w,j4fnbzw,,I've never been truly homeless, though it could happen any day now. That said, OP, I have always fully believed in your 2nd paragraph on wishing those who look down on the homeless would end up walking not just a mile in the homeless' shoes, but miles. I'd have them do "just" 3 months* without any change of clothing, no access to any bank account, no shitty vehicle to live in allowed for the first 2 months, no ID at all, friends and family not allowed to shelter them; nothing but the clothes on their back and maybe $10 to their name. It would have to be mid Fall, so they'd have a month to prepare best they could for winter.  *3 months isn't crap compared to the majority of homeless people. I fully know this. BUT I almost guarantee within 4 little weeks they'd be PLEADING to stop the "experiment".  I would say "Nope. Let's add on 2 more months just so you TRULY understand. Because if you were freed of this right now at 4 small weeks, within 3 weeks you'd lessen all you've gone through so far and would be right back to your horrible anti homeless mind set. I'm not seeking to give you irreparable trauma - despite the fact most all homeless people indeed get irreparable trauma - but I'm seeking to make and ensure you never EVER forget this and continue to feel empathy for and literally help the homeless once this is over for you. For many, it never ends until it Ends."  I truly hope this would be a means to get much needed empathy from those who Have. We are all a paycheck away from homelessness. Or a medical issue away. Or a fire away. Or anything.   Anything.
10c3b9w,,j4hi1wq,Wouldn‚Äôt even need to add on the extra months. I‚Äôd love nothing more for people to really grasp (because shit I think most of us didn‚Äôt grasp it either even as we were watching our situations fall apart) how once you‚Äôre homeless it all gets way harder than you‚Äôd ever think to turn it around. Like the point to truly help a homeless person and make the biggest difference in life is before they become homeless in the first place. The irony is it would probably be a lot more cost effective and keep people able to be functioning and contributing members of society without all the mental and physical health shit that hits fast and hard once you‚Äôre homeless.   I know I knew I was about to become homeless and I foolishly believed it would just take me a few months, maybe 6, to get back on my feet. Yeeeah. I had no freaking idea how bad it was going to get or how much everything about homelessness only compounds and keeps you down. It‚Äôs really hard if not impossible to put into words and really make someone understand without experiencing it. There‚Äôs always people (I see discussions like this all the time over in the poverty finance sub and want to shout ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs so easy why are you subscribed here?‚Äù) who talk this big game about how anyone can just bootstrap their way out of anything. I wanna ask those people have you tried doing it while disabled? While your teeth are rotting and you can hardly think straight from the pain but can‚Äôt afford dental care. When you haven‚Äôt had a place to lay head in weeks? When they tell you there‚Äôs a six month wait to even get a bed at the local shelter and you‚Äôre all out of places to turn? And on and on and on it spirals. Even if you luck into a vaguely decent social service org or your name comes up after freaking years on an affordable housing list there‚Äôs so many near impossible hoops you have to jump through even then.   If anything I‚Äôm continuously impressed by every success story I ever hear on this sub. It feels downright miraculous that anyone ever makes it back out of homelessness.
10c3b9w,,j4ihtwy,You're preaching the truth. Too hard to come from the gutter to stay afloat in the sewer.  I have read many young kids being tossed out in the streets by parents. They should be held accountable for that right there. It's nothing but wrong and should be a crime.  These are not the times for kids to be forced into seriously unfortunate situations.
10c3b9w,,j4igpve,You just said it. The power in your words.
10c3b9w,j4ge30z,,I was homeless one time. I never forgot the people that turned their backs on me. People that treated me like I was nothing. Now they walk around smiling and they have forgotten. Trust no one
10c3b9w,,j4i5uqb,I'm pretty sure people end up doing this because it's "too close for comfort" - aka "Jesus, this could easily happen to me since it happened to my friend in my circle. I need to ignore this. Out of sight out of mind and then it won't happen to me."  It sure seems like that was the case, ESPECIALLY how now they're acting like your homeless time never happened. Like the "omg it could happen to me" threat is neutralized and they can remain safely existing in their personal "all is fine, things can go back to normal" safety bubble since it's not facing the threat of being popped any more.   I sure hope you're not giving them much or any of your time. They turned their back on you when you needed them the most and now think it's all fine and dandy now that you're off the streets? Bullshit. Doesn't work that way.  I'm so sorry you had to experience that. What a cruel betrayal.
10c3b9w,j4gqahe,,PTSD. Homelessness comes with it. Trust issues, flashbacks, nightmares, startle response, and all the emotions and thoughts (including anger, which is valid!) etc. It's all valid. It's not "paranoia" if you've lived it. And the only way out is through, though you never lose it completely. You learn to adapt in your own (hopefully heathy) way. Speaking from experience. I'm sorry. I feel great empathy for everyone going through this. But nothing is wrong with you. You had to adapt to, and experience, abnormal (sometimes life-threatening, always traumatic) situations. You do that in the best way you know how. You'll never unlearn it, you will never completely lose that anger, but you can learn to abide with it, and hopefully thrive, in your own way.
10c3b9w,j4euw5x,,Lord knows i understand this.
10c3b9w,j4fcry7,,Same.  It sucks because I'm by nature a friendly and giving person but no, I quickly remind myself that none of these people would do the same for me and I refrain from a nice gesture I might have done
10c3b9w,j4gw3ue,,It feels like the only people who understand this feeling are the ones who have been homeless right?  I was homeless for quite a while and I know exactly what you mean. I'm so sorry you went through that and I hope you are able to heal from the scars it leaves.
10c3b9w,j4jb2pf,,I had a Denny's waitress literally kick me out, cause I was charging my phone, but I go there like twice a month. I wanted to sit and charge, afterwards, it wasn't crowded. And drink coffee for a few hours...
10c3b9w,j4mxg2k,,I‚Äôve been struggling with the exact same feelings.  Sometimes though, the simplest, simplest thing can turn me around.  Like getting a smile at the coffee shop, or like, I still do DoorDash because I‚Äôm immensely poor haha But a lady gave me $20 and seemed almost more shy about it than I was, and I broke down crying in the car.  It was such a mix of feelings‚Ä¶a lot of it resentment at being put in a place where something like that makes me cry.  But I made myself stop, and change my perspective.  I was able to feel such immense appreciation.  It js a beautiful, beautiful thing.  The people who made me feel small, and worthless, will never, ever feel such beauty.  And that made me rise up higher than they could ever be with just some money.  Anyway, I try to change my perspective a lot, it really does help.  Recognize your true value; the value strangers put on you is ill-informed, ignorant, and speculative.  So it‚Äôs simply just wrong.
10c3b9w,j4fujwy,,i know what you feel bro some people are monsters even if you consider them friends
10c3b9w,j4g2r0e,,I agree with Ladyinatent try to let it go... hang on to love and kindness and try to let the rest of the bs go. And I know it‚Äôs easier said then done... best regards from me.
10c3b9w,j4gtcun,,PTSD  I can't forget, either.  Best wishes to you, please be kind to yourself  it's them; not you
10c3b9w,j4h7lie,,It‚Äôs the cycle.   I haven‚Äôt been homeless, but I often feel closer than I should. If I did end up homeless, what frightens me just as much as the elements is the discovery of all the deceit and BS I would receive from ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily‚Äù.   People have become so used to writing a ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù and acting that very, VERY few people are genuine.  When the chips are down, you‚Äôll see the kinds of ‚Äúanimals‚Äù people are.   Life is cruel.  This is why humanity can‚Äôt move forward.  So you have to break the chain, learn, teach others about these experiences.
10c3b9w,j4hb8k0,,I understand. And feel the same way. It changes you.
10c3b9w,j4hpfep,,Don‚Äôt forget, and don‚Äôt force yourself to forget. Just be thankful for the good people and joyful moments, and all the memories will stop haunting you at some point.
10c3b9w,j4hq4fn,,People don't realize that most people are just a few unfortunate circumstances from being homeless
10c3b9w,j4gvfck,,You're not wrong. The world can be cruel and evil, and you got a larger share of it than most people. All I can say is, I'm glad you're out of it. But you're right that society is heartless. Like the top commentor said, just try to focus on your happiness now. But you're right.
10c3b9w,j4kwmxl,,I am sorry you got to experience this very sad and very cold side of life.  Bad things happen sometimes. Bad people happen sometimes too. Best you can do is live your best life and get far away from people like that.
10c3b9w,j4vwzbc,,I‚Äôm really sorry for what you went through. I really hope you can make peace with the injustices that you faced and that you didn‚Äôt deserve. In the meantime, know that I‚Äôll remember your message and act every day thinking about other people that are going through the same experience.
10c3b9w,j4efkbw,,Hatred is good, a plot to obliterate the planet is better. Just joking, perhaps :)
10c3b9w,j4ie72g,,This is a great thread on Reddit.  Many of the real people across America are voicing their opinions on here and Iove it. I don't like it when being attacked on political adversities between which is better, Dems or Reps. Both sides have their faults. I know I was doing a hell of a lot better before the Dems took total control of the house, senate and presidency. Yes, before the commie virus the country seemed to be rolling in a good direction. I was doing great back in those days even with  wife sick with stage four breast üéÄ cancer. The last straw for her was losing her beautiful silk long hair from just one chemo IV treatment. Once she lost her hair, she gave up on me and the Cancer Warrior fight. God bless her Soul!  She was always after me to find better or more life insurance. A wife of 38 years doesn't won't to leave her husband behind without a pot to piss in if they truly loved them. She gave up to leave me all alone to battle this mess we all live in now.  Certainly, I was grieving and still do go through those motions. I also lost my only daughter just less than two years earlier. You know  I have been through that emotional process and still struggle with it each and every day!  I made some bad decisions with what was left in savings from work and the difference left from her life insurance policies. I spent some on grandchildren who have actually abandoned me now, but that is okay.  I had to be the unfortunate one of not being able to predict the future as the most beautiful place we shared in the Great Smoky Mountains was put on the market for sale. I moved back to her hometown to relocate and try to start over.  I was lucky that I had those money resources to fall back on. Yes, I have a fairly decent 2- bd, 1 bath home with everything. I never use the bedrooms as I sleep with her dog on the sofa. It's wasted space I pay for on the back side of the house. Too bad I can't find a smaller place, just part of this housing shortage availability I suppose.  I pay for electrical, water and the rent. I used the system for everything I can receive to help me stay afloat. If it's there, you better be wise enough to use it. Never let nothing slide. I use free antenna TV and many boxes of the best movies you can watch today on cd. Watching the western "Open Range" now with Duvall and Kevin Costner. Going to cook supper shortly.  I used the ACP to get my phone service for free now. I should have started that months ago. I'll probably upgrade it to the max to pay the difference so I can try to bring in more money from writing online and other ways. I can get free HBO doing that too with Cricket.  I was fortunate enough to be able to receive senior EBT as I turn 64 in the middle of February.  You see, I count my many blessings. I have a home, a paid off car, and all the neccessaties to survive. GOD has been good to me through it all.  I have to stay focused each day. I can make some wrong moves and be right out there in the street struggling. The hardest part of all this is the loneliness. I am not one to be alone. I need that companionship of a woman again. To have someone by my side again. You don't do a lifetime with a woman to have it suddenly switched off as say, by a button.  Everyday I'm shoveling, fighting that fight on how I can find another good woman to help me win the battle.  All the pieces are slowly in place, but I need God to show me the way!  I'm just rambling, trying to be a voice of hope I suppose. I just loved this thread and wanted to share some hope for many others.
10c3b9w,,j4isvun,I agree, there is hope.
10c3b9w,j4fz8gn,,I waste alot.   I will probably burn in hell for not giving what i can not ever need to someone else
10c3b9w,j4h2f5u,,I think you need therapy, my friend. Yes, bad things happened to you. For whatever reason they had, people didn't want to, or couldn't, help you. But that doesn't mean you have to keep the trauma going. It doesn't mean you can't be happy and find joy and help others. Don't let what happened to you crush who you could be. Don't let your struggle become your identity. You need healing so you can be happy with your life. There are free and low cost therapy if you seek it out. I wish you peace.
10c3b9w,j4e9p7e,,Sorry to say but people don‚Äôt like / care for homeless people but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a backstory your not mentioning in your rant as to why everyone in your life turned there backs
10c3b9w,,j4eh7ve,There's often a backstory, and more often there's not. The average friend is a fair weather friend and a backstabber and a creature of comfort, and my need is (perceived as) a threat by my "friends", especially the well to do ones. They'd rather do that thing certain girls are known to do, dress nice and go to upscale places to feed off the breadcrumbs of the rich, instead of tending the wounds of the weak. I should have learned all I needed to learn about "friends" when a big chunk of them changed political views overnight just to secure some monetary gains when I was at the tender age of 18. Sure, politics does not mirror 1-1 interpersonal relationships but still, if they can do that they can do all kinds of backstabbing too.
10c3b9w,,j4ekdox,I can share a different experience.  At three different times in my life, I have let friends move in with me until they got back on their feet.  Each time I had to ask them to leave after six months, none of them had found jobs by then, and it was a good economy each time.  One of them never spoke to us again.  Another was a childhood friend; it took quite a few years for us to patch up the damage.  The third went into rehab after we asked her to leave and has had a fantastic life for the last 25 years.  I would be hesitant to let another friend move in to help them back on their feet.
10c3b9w,,j4em2iy,I don't blame you. Which is why me and perhaps 100's of people I've met have preferred to spend months broke and homeless rather than ask for money and more from those closest to us. Of course I cannot testify against Jesus who said "ask and you shall receive"! All I'm saying is a lot of the more upstanding but unlucky fellow humans reserved the "call a friend" option for life threatening circumstances, as opposed to maintaining a level of comfort.
10c3b9w,,j4f8zuv,I'm not really sure but when Jesus stated, "ask and you shall receive.," was that meant to receive grace and the gift of the holy spirit? Or another way would be to believe it means to ask God in prayer for what you need and he will supply it?
10c3b9w,,j4fpgfv,In the context of "move any mountain" and such I'd take it to mean material stuff in addition to everything else. Plus there's a bit of "we're all Gods" theology in many religions including John 10:34, which goes hand in hand with heretical "manifestation theology" that suggests we all have exactly what we asked for, we "manifested" our realities.
10c3b9w,,j4fc2kn,Why do you think they couldn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt find a job in six months? Were you clear on expectations?
10c3b9w,,j4gohdg,They all three had different issues.  If I were to allow a friend to move in I would set better expectations.  But yes, the expectation was that we were offering them a place to stay while they found a job and saved money to find a place to live.
10c3b9w,,j4gpwu5,Did you guys periodically ask where they were at with their progress? Also, what were there explanation of why they hadn‚Äôt found a job or did they even apply to jobs. I know finding a good job takes a while, but a stepping stone jobs should be a lot faster to find
10c3b9w,j4e030o,,I just wouldn't sweat this. You want to know why?   With the present rate this economy is heading, many of them you wished for will be joining the ranks of homeless and poor.  The bad times haven't arrived yet. Yet, many of those making it now continue to throw away their money on foolishness.  Wasting trips back n forth to town. Eating out and quick trips for drive-by takeout. They wasting their money on latest junk high-tech gadgets, such as new phones, laptops, Ipads, etc. Burning money on Television entertainment, expensive internet, cable. satellite, etc.  When the money crunch really happens, it will be hard to pay basic bills because they will be laid off jobs due to this bideninflation. Some serious sh*t is getting ready to go down!!!!!
10c3b9w,,j4eow68,Bideninflation? How do you figure Joe Biden caused the global inflation that preceded him even being elected by a good 6 months? Did he time travel back to March of 2020 and whisper sorcery into the ears of Trump and Republicans to pass the $2.4 Trillion Covid relief bill (most of which was handed out to the wealthy because fuck the working class) with Trump's name scrawled across the stimulus checks so come election time everyone would remember just who gave everyone free money? Did Biden then return to his normal timeline and sneak into the White House to hold a gun at Trump's head to force him to sign another $1.4 Trillion Covid relief bill in late December 2020 even after losing the election?   Or maybe it was Hunter Biden who smoked so much crack that he fell into a time vortex and sabotaged all the microchip manufacturing factories in Southeast Asia, then snuck aboard the cargo ship Ever Given and wedged it into the Suez Canal to create a global shipping blockade that took 18 months to fully recover from *and then* steal a magic flying carpet from an Egyptian museum and bounce around the planet seeding bird flu amongst chicken farms so it would slowly build up and hit the world like a ton of bricks a month after his father won the 2020 Presidential Election in order to sabotage his dad's presidency?   And of course we can't forget about those evil SocialistNaziCommieSJWLGBTransBLMtifas like AOC and ~~The Squad~~ The Coven who must have used witchcraft to influence then-President Trump to negotiate with OPEC to cut oil production to a trickle in Spring 2020 to keep the price of oil from bottoming out in order to save the American tar sands oil companies from going bankrupt, and in the event he lost the 2020 election for OPEC to not resume pre-pandemic production to hurt his political enemies!   Last but not least, that fucking Super Duper Double Secret Muslim *BARAK* Obama using his Deep State allies over at DARPA to give 2021 President Joe Biden access to their Temporal 5G Mind Control Cell Phone to prank call Trump waaaay back in January 2018 and trick him into starting a ridiculous trade war with China that bankrupted American farming families across the nation as well as significantly driving up raw materials costs for American manufacturers that ultimately get passed on to consumers!  Goddamned Joe Biden is a fucking *MENACE!* I just didn't see it before now but it's all so clear after you pointed out that global inflation is Biden's fault! Thank you so much for enlightening not only me, but surely all who read your comment!
10c3b9w,,j4eznb9,Enlighten us with your magnificent vision on how "Build Back Better" is actually solving anything. That pile of crap isn't resolving anything but spending trillions of more bucks, increasing the national debt that will never be paid!!!!!  Curious minds want to know why
10c3b9w,,j4g3ijb,Actually Democrats spend less than Republicans *and* they fund their programs unlike the Republicans who just use hand-wavey "this will generate 3%+ growth and pay for itself!" which of course it never does, leaving the next Democrat administration to clean up the GOP mess.   Weird how Democrat Presidents with Democrat Congress keep reducing the deficit and balancing budgets while Republicans keep bloating deficits and piling on national debt only to reach both hands down their trousers to clutch those pearls whenever Democrats dare spend a single penny.   Also weird how Republicans keep crashing the economy and then blaming it on Democrats spending money 10-14 years earlier but will claim credit for the booming economy on Day 1 after replacing a Democrat administration who rebuilt the economy after a crash.   Over and over and over again, round and round we go, despite all evidence to the contrary some people still think the GOP is the party of "fiscal responsibility" when nothing could be further from the truth--kinda like how those same people keep saying the GOP stands for Free Speech while they ban words, entire fields of study, music, books while having a good ol' fashioned book burning parties, and even existing as one's true self. Now the GOP wants to ban interracial marriage, gay marriage, create database of all trans people, force trans people under age of 25 to transition *back* because it makes church folk all huffy, and control what happens in the private bedrooms of American citizens. Yup, those damned Democrats are tyrants and Republicans are all about Freedumbz!  But hey, at least we can pin that global inflation that started because of a shit trade war and shit response to a pandemic on a President who wasn't even in office, and on a Bill that hadn't been written. Nevermind the falling fuel prices and nearly non-existent unemployment that has been a direct result of the Biden administration policies, and certainly close your eyes good'n tight so you'll not notice all the Republican politicians who fought tooth & nail & voted against BBB only to go back to their home States and *claim credit for the benefits to their constituency* because they're goddamned lying ghouls.
10c3b9w,,j4f7ih6,I won't play political as the game is totally rigged. The Country is past the point of return to normalcy.  Bird flu has nothing to do with the Greed of corporations. Why the hangup with birdflu? You referring it to the sudden inflated grocery prices being blamed on weather, war or so-called supply chain issue?  NO, biden wasn't a menace. Just another crooked politician trying to line his pockets with YOUR gold!   What makes it so bad is they're too dirty to tell anything but lies to the American public. Lying about inflation, two negative quarters isn't a recession, but we might be in this new-named slowcession or some kind of garbage.  Hunter biden IS  meth or crackhead. A look at his recent past history will completely explain it all, from shady business overseas to this week, we're hearing"holding on to some classified documents" for his Dad biden. Oh yes, and some have been recovered from dad's private home, which were from vice-presidential days with Obamboo. Thats a felony buster.  It will take 20 years or more to ever recover from this mess happening. You have no dam* leadership. None of them act like they have a clue on how to operate the country as a business. A divided country in many more ways than just dems and reps.  We can be in a major war at any moment. Nobody is prepared for it. A few bad moves overseas and another mess hits to worry about.  This Country has completely went off the deep end since your biden took over. Tied up oil production in the USA to get into a tight bad enough to go BEG Saudi Arabia for their filthy oil. Those Saudis were laughing at that old man going out the door!  Botched Afghanistan withdrawal killing Americans in the process. Left multi millions  of bucks in sophisticated weapons behind for the enemies pleasure. All on biden and doing what he has always done.  And yes it is on biden with inflation as he is suppose to be the sitting president, which always have to take what comes.  When you come in screwing everything ya touch up, you got to be responsible for it and admit "I done that!" Rehearse it with me 6 - 12 months from now if we still breathing.
10c3b9w,j5i1njv,,I feel like once you see this disgusting side of humanity it‚Äôs a little hard to forget it. You see it everywhere and in everyone. I feel ya.

10c3b9w,,j4lzg1b,Haha, log off reddit.
10bz0eu,j4dhh6o,,Yes, but I think a lot of it is because I'm a smaller woman. I won't go into a private home. No telling if I'll ever get out.   You develop a sixth sense, always distrustful of situations that seem too good to be true. I think I'm still around because I follow my gut.
10bz0eu,,j4dhumv,How do they approach you?
10bz0eu,,j4f6ivj,They literally come up to you and ask. I've been approached by people outside of a church, while in my tent (they literally slapped the top like they were knocking on a door), outside of a shelter. I don't immediately look homeless but I've got a large pack, which is kind of a giveaway.
10bz0eu,,j4ek0ty,LOL, you reckon the average good Samaritan is a Ted Bundy wannabe? Men only have a pole that is looking for a hole, that's it. Men explained!
10bz0eu,,j4f889v,My fear and distrust is funny to you? No, I don't think every man is a serial killer. And if they're a "Ted Bundy wannabe" whatever the fuck that means, yeah, then they sound pretty dangerous.   Obviously most people don't care about a homeless woman (that's kind of a separate problem) but I don't want to take that risk. I've been groped and assaulted before, by "good" men, by men with badges, by fellow homeless men. Will someone eventually take it too far and kill me? I don't want to find out but I also don't think that's the only bad thing that can happen to a vulnerable woman. From experience,  I can tell you that there are plenty of bad things that they can do to you that leave you very much alive, but not wanting to be.
10bz0eu,,j4iqvmn,You are smart. Stick to your intuition.
10bz0eu,,j4jccf8,Thank you, perhaps I was too sharp with that response, because, of course there are good men, MOST men are good men, and I've known some pretty heinous women too. It's just, you know, you get your guard up when your homeless. I'm kinda little, and I don't want to get caught in a bad situation.
10bz0eu,,j4jxq5z,You have to guard yourself from harm before being afraid off not coming across as nice. People‚Äôs feelings may get hurt, but you are in a vulnerable position.  Sometimes people‚Äôs niceness has cost them their lives.
10bz0eu,,j4vjc1p,Absolutely.  It's the ugly truth we live with.

10bz0eu,j4de12e,,Many , many of them are just looking for sex when they do.  And from what I‚Äôve seen, pretty much anyone that isn‚Äôt actually just looking for sex , is accused of just offering it for sex .  Kinda keeps people quiet.  Tried once and got jumped by some asshat accusing me of all kinds of shit, so why would you?
10bz0eu,,j4dga55,Wait why did they jump you If they offered you a place??
10bz0eu,,j4dgily,Cause there is a class of people in this sub that doesn‚Äôt believe anyone would ever offer to help someone else without some ulterior motive .
10bz0eu,,j4dgrqi,Yeah i mean I see why they think that but in my experiences I do see people feeding the homeless just to do it
10bz0eu,,j4ek5vr,Yes, in the absence of dogs and pigeons one is forced to feed whatever one can find on the streets :)
10bz0eu,j4j58pt,,As a female I was offered all kinds of things when I was on the street, but I would **never** go anywhere with anyone. If someone wanted to help me out by giving me a few bucks or getting me something to eat, that‚Äôs fine, but I wouldn‚Äôt get in someone‚Äôs car or anything, it just wasn‚Äôt a risk I could take. I would always tell the younger girls, as a matter of your own safety assume that any offer has a price. Yes, there are people out there who offer things and want nothing in return, but when you‚Äôre a female on your own, you simply **cannot** afford to allow anyone to think that you owe them.
10bz0eu,j4el6qt,,Probably some "action" is taking place in DMs and is not shared, but I don't really think people do the very random thing, they need to warm up over weeks and months of posts and messages. After all for us that have been round the block, it doesn't make much sense to jump in with an offer when we know very well that hundreds of other options and conditions need to be explored and evaluated. If it was something unequivocal like "I'm on top of mount Shasta and will probably freeze to death tonight" I feel it might trigger an immediate response.
10bz0eu,j4f94d3,,Yes, and it sucked every time.   One started stalking me and sending me endless text threads of threats when I left to check myself into the hospital for suicidal thoughts. After he already swindled me out of money. Found out he was a convicted stalker with a LONG rap sheet of terrorizing people.   Second ended up being a pedophile, and I didn‚Äôt know until I was already there with nowhere to go. Definitely experienced unwanted touching and sexual advances.  Third‚Ä¶ you guessed it! Another predator. Constantly hitting on me and coming in the room they lent to me. Also swindled me out of rent money. You see a pattern?   That being said, these options were still better than any of the shelters I went to. Isn‚Äôt that sad?
10bz0eu,,j4irojl,Yes. That is very sad. Sickos. i hate people taking advantage of vulnerable people.
10bz0eu,,j4z8my2,I went through the exact same thing myself. It was so bad each time that I had to up and leave.
10bz0eu,j4fu1uj,,It makes me really sad that there are so many bad people out there. I would love to help you guys, just because. Just because you are worthy. Just because it is our right to exist. Just because I love you. And I am nothing special, either. Everyone should help others in need. It saddens me to see where humanity is headed.
10bz0eu,,j4gylqc,Headed ?  It arrived a long time ago.  This world is fxxked.
10bz0eu,,j4hiv5v,True. Unfortunately
10bz0eu,j4h6alb,,Yeah some drunk guy stumbled on the pier where I slept for several months and woke me up specifically to ask if it was OK if he hung around for a bit. I thought this guy was just being courteous, do I responded with "we're on public property, you don't need my permission". He then sits down ridiculously close and starts begging me to live him. I repeatedly tell him I'm not comfortable with being in strangers houses, and then he just falls asleep. 45min later, his vodka spills all over my blankets, and he wakes up, takes a piss 2ft away from me, and tries spooning me. Had to run him off with my blade
10bz0eu,j4fzi7l,,No not yet
10bz0eu,j4hrg76,,I had this happen, but I didn‚Äôt take him up on it. It was a guy that wanted fringe benefits though.
10bx258,j4di006,,Yeah, follow your gut and stay safe. Weird can get so much worse real fast. I even took help once from a woman (do a bit of laundry, take a shower) and when I got to her place, there was her boyfriend, she never mentioned him, said she lived alone. He reached for my bags and I just grabbed my stuff and got out of there.
10bx258,,j4dkv5q,Really what I'm seeking advice with: taking the leap to go from homelessness into a flat and not picking an absolute psycho who would take advantage of the situation or making living unbearable to the point where i go back to the street. There is a shock that goes along with this.   I lived out of a suitcase for awhile and even when i lived with now ex husband and when i was happily married. I couldn't bring myself take my things out of the suitcase and put it on a shelf. There comes a psychological shock and adjustment to paying bills. Letting go of the fear of police breaking down the door or welding barricades keeping from people getting in. (Yes we do that). So much of my time and energy goes into keeping myself and things safe and skills used for homeless life. That going into normal life might be difficult.
10bx258,,j4f77ps,Oh God, I wouldn't even know where to begin! You know, you just are always on edge, always looking for the angles people are going to work on you. I don't think I can trust anyone. It's hardwired into our survival, you know, it's like a part of me now. I guess, well, if given the chance, I would definitely jump at the opportunity to take a hot shower whenever I wanted. But, you know you're always going to have your bags ready to grab when things go sideways.  I guess my advice is know that you've earned this opportunity,  you bled and cried and suffered just to claw your way out of this life. You deserve an opportunity to feel normal.  That feeling may take a while, but you damn well take the opportunity because you deserve to get back on your feet. The transition might take a while, like how veterans must feel when they get back from war. There's a huge mental stress that makes us kinda crazy, I hope it goes away and that you will find peace soon.
10bx258,,j4fh8c4,I have time but yeah i guess it's about finding a good balance. I have a friend who has a spare room that maybe i could rent out but he has a pretty bad crack problem and he can be moody and unpredictable.   I can't settle on a a place just a little outside my price range because i don't want to be stuck broke in a few months. My boss saids it should pick up more hours soon. But the thing is i don't predict the future and i don't count on money that i don't have. It's not sustainable. Also something too. I'm on the fine line of getting my paperwork to be legal in this country and i think being in this type of position leaves me pretty vulnerable. It took me 5 years to get to this point and if i get with the wrong roommate who fucks with my post it could fuck up literally everything.  Yes i have trust issues but when your two steps away from being deported who wouldn't.   My job is legal i have a contract and everything but still I'm so fearful.
10bx258,,j4jbcb9,I'll keep you in my thoughts. I can only imagine the stress of being so close to a stable life and yet it could fall apart any minute. Stay strong and follow your intuition!
10bx258,,j4iv9eu,If she lied about that, then there was more to come.
10bx258,,j59yci6,Lied about what?
10bx258,,j5axjip,That the woman that brought her there said to OP she was living alone.
10bx258,,j5ayg1y,Ah ok! I was for some reason unsure what you meant....I'm a bit slow sometimes üò∏
10bx258,,j5bct4g,No problem, me too sometimes
10bx258,j4d6j6n,,Nothing is ever free with this lifestyle.
10bx258,j4iv5ga,,People that live alone are mostly mentally ill, alone, anti-social.  They want to help at first or need the rent money, but they don‚Äôt really want you there or use the kitchen. It‚Äôs harder to find well adjusted people. If you can find well adjusted person, I would get together to rent a place to yourselves.
10bx258,j4eikex,,Come on, you can't possibly go through life carrying this negativity mental hell, because I got the patent on it! Most people are decent and, for the few that aren't there's rules and laws to stop them in their tracks. I don't know if you've heard the joke about the guy who's car broke down and was running all kinds of negative scenarios in his head while walking towards someone who could help, and when he finally meets the potential good samaritan screams in his face "fuck you and your help". Don't be that guy!
10bx258,,j59y60d,So helpful....  Ever considered that there might be fucking good reasons to have those fears?

I‚Äôve lived in two when I was younger and in both it was straight up volunteers in the kitchen (and sometimes the kids themselves) making fantastic home cooked meals. Some of my fondest memories of both shelters was the food.   Even knowing youth shelters are about the best it gets in the shelter world though-  this slop on a tray is an insult. Do they provide any packaged snacks? Shelter in my town has long waits to get an actual bed but at least they have daily drop-in and like potato chip baggies and cookies and good name brand stuff. Wish I could hook you up because this is inhumane.

10bvmdq,j4dtv6d,,I want the commenters bringing up jail and prison on this post, to understand, that there would be a literal fucking \*riot\* if this was being served to inmates in the U.S. lol I am not exaggerating.   Jail food is not great, it's often not even rated for human consumption, but if this is what your diet consists of, OP, I may suggest you get yourself locked up for a few weeks to get your strength up.
10bvmdq,,j4f53xl,I was going to comment similar on the riot front. Shoot, the shelter residents should riot too. Probably too weak from malnutrition or sick in the bathroom with food poisoning tho.
10bvmdq,j4dwasj,,The incarnation of botulism has awakened.
10bvmdq,j4dxlpu,,That food sure is very, uh, gray
10bvmdq,,j4e66l3,That candle from beauty and the beast lied, the gray stuff is indeed not delicious
10bvmdq,j4e07wf,,Well, the bread looks good
10bvmdq,j4e88fs,,That would give me the bubbleguts
10bvmdq,,j4e8h1y,Jokes on you, you won‚Äôt even be able to shit
10bvmdq,,j4e8xvc,Should serve that with a laxative tablet
10bvmdq,,j4gp3uf,I honestly don‚Äôt even think the laxative would have any effect
10bvmdq,,j4hks5k,They gave us MREs. They're horrible. Lotsa gas
10bvmdq,j4f9ulr,,That looks like vomit. I‚Äôm sorry you were exposed to that. I would put some free jam on that bread and eat.  Although if that is hash brown, I‚Äôd eat that.

10bvlr0,j4d15qe,,Where at? So we can avoid this place
10bvlr0,j4ccigs,,That‚Äôs terrible to hear.   I wonder if the kitchen staff are volunteers who just suck at cooking or if they are homeless haters doing community service hours.
10bvlr0,,j4ccmms,I made another post with the pic of the tray, this food comes directly from the local prison
10bvlr0,,j4e802g,Who would have the time to waste to purposely hate on Homeless and volunteer? I feel like most volunteers are putting their best effort to help people, what would be your preference?
10bvlr0,,j4ehp7n,as the guy said, court ordered community service. But no, I don't find the scenario likely, even if you hate the motley crew that is the homeless, you wouldn't risk getting stabbed in the eye with a fork by some irritable/unstable bum.
10bvlr0,j4dim0h,,Yes, where is this. Any chance at getting this exposed locally?
10bvlr0,,j4gp0ug,I seriously seriously hope OP tells us. OP has no personally identifying info on this account. they could totally let us know where this is, and no one will never know who took those pics.
10bvlr0,j4f8vb9,,Well I had cold oatmeal with skin on top for nearly 2 years. Thank goodness for SNAP! Because I‚Äôd have starved to death. And that oatmeal didn‚Äôt even have any sugar because they always ran out by the time I got my plate and the kitchen staff refused to put out more!
10bvlr0,j4cdlht,,Welcome to America
10bvlr0,j4do9pp,,We cannot be choosers
10bvlr0,,j4e7l9c,No, dude, fuck that shit. That's going to get someone killed, especially when they're out on the street, or sickly. God only knows what the cooks are doing, or what the rest of the kitchen looks like. Everyone deserves dignity and respect, especially those who struggle the most.  There's a ton of homeless people who are disabled, immunocompromised, elderly, or all the above. Not to mention a ton of children and pregnant women. Hell, I have digestive issues, and a bout of food poisoning can land me in the hospital, or in the ground. The struggle to find food that wouldn't kill me while I was homeless was fucking scary.  Whatever this place is, it needs to be exposed, called out, and shut down. They're endangering so many people. What's the point of seeking shelter so you don't have to eat diseased garbage, if they're going to feed you diseased garbage?
10bvlr0,,j4edncy,Thank you.Exactly.I went to a service this morning.The food looked disgusting,and similar.Homeless are not subhuman.Don't know if I would have gave it to a dog.
10bvlr0,,j4ehvif,Yeah, shame on whoever's upvoting that comment. Raw chicken's inedible, no way of cutting around that. We deserve dignity, respect, and the right to live. People in our community need to stop being complicit with our oppression.
10bvlr0,,j4epkjr,Do we really deserve anything?
10bvlr0,,j4gpma4,We deserve the freedom to gather and eat food.  All animals have this freedom. But it is taken away from humans. We are not allowed to hunt (without expensive license and equipment), we are not allowed fish (without expensive license), we are not allowed to gather fruits and vegetables anywhere legally, and all edible plants and trees have been purposely removed from public spaces. Hell we aren't even allowed to bathe or drink from rivers and streams because they've either been fenced off, diverted into pipes, or polluted by for-profit industries.  Squirrels and deer and other animals still can... they can eat and drink anything they see outdoors, and can sleep anywhere they want. But not humans. Humans have been purposefully limited/imprisoned in their world.  Considering we are being actively and purposefully limited/imprisoned in our own world, those who are responsible for our status must provide us with alternative sources of food. If they do not, then this is tantamount to cruelty or torture.  It's like keeping a hamster locked up in a cage.. or a cat locked up in your house. once you take responsibility for this animal by locking them up and away from their natural food source, you BECOME RESPONSIBLE for feeding them. NOT feeding them would be cruel torture. Leaving them outdoors, chained to a rope in your yard when it is freezing out would also be torture. It would be murder, really.  Humans are no different.
10bvlr0,,j4h2rej,What a thoughtful response. Thank you.
10bvi0i,j4enb2v,,Actually, my first couple of months I was totally unaware. What was really killing me, or rather killing those around me, was rainy weather with synthetic fibers. I knew it was "starting to smell" but no, once you visited someone, warmed up the bacteria and mixed them up with whatever sofa and chair materials they had, it was a nightmare!
10bvi0i,,j4gidw3,Ah okay. I guess I would never think that our body odor could just fly under our radar. For me, i could always smell myself (at least a little bit). But yeah, i hate the rainy weather for that reason, especially when I sleep on the grass üò´
10bvi0i,,j4j4705,I mean, you/I can go from unclean to smelly-as-hell by being out in the cold rain for a few minutes and then warming up indoors for 10 minutes.
10bvi0i,,j4j1ejr,Haha‚Ä¶ glad you figured it out.  I have bad sense of smell most times, so can‚Äôt smell much.
10bvi0i,j4g0x1w,,Most people are unaware they stink homeless or not. The brain adapts to strong smells after awhile to it doesn‚Äôt overload your senses.
10bvi0i,,j4g2mzu,Interesting. As for me, i know I smell (and I do smell myself) but it's not strong. I wonder if that has anything to do with the brain adaptation. Even if I don't smell myself, i would assume that i do smell due to not being consistent with personal hygienic care. Thanks for sharing
10bvi0i,j4ggh3d,,Its intentional. Its to further humiliate us which they feel better because they put you down. Yes we are aware and already selfconcious about it. But thats people for you. Soulution i found tho, i met a hooker and made friends with her. She let me come and shower few times a week and wash my clothes in the tub.
10bvi0i,,j4ggres,I agree with you. People love to put others down just to feel better about themselves.
10bvi0i,,j4gn964,Yea but it says alot about them.
10bvi0i,j4gy3vb,,The only time someone has said "you stink" to me and my partner while we were homeless they actually were the security guy of the library we were resting in. He gave us resources to get showers. I was so glad that he didn't just insult us and go. And the only reason he even said that we stunk was because the complaints of the rich folk around us.
10bvi0i,j4egcmz,,How hard is it to come up with $11 per month for a Planet Fitness membership (idk how about selling $30 out that $281 in food stamps...)? During the Summer laundry is free; wash your clothes while taking a shower and wear them out
10bvi0i,,j4es1gr,It's not just the 11 dollars. It's also the fees, having a valid ID, and a real bank account, no prepaid. Its not than any of these things individually are not attainable, but having them all at the same time.
10bvi0i,,j4fjp5k,>It's also the fees, having a valid ID, and a real bank account, no prepaid  Bullshit. ID - homeless service center around the country provide vouchers to get a state ID for free. Some even have a DMV mobile office show up on site. A real bank account, not prepaid - again bullshit. IDK about all the prepaid cards. But the ones that I've used in the past come with an account and routing number which is all you need. Even so, you can open a bank account with Zero money.
10bvi0i,,j4gxun1,Firstly, you missed the point. Again, it's not that the things *individually* aren't attainable but rather having them together at the same time. Being homeless makes it incredibly difficult to do so due to theft, not being able to charge your device, internet connection, mobility, and overall moral.   Why are so committed to oversimplifying the homeless experience?
10bvi0i,,j4gyrmd,>Again  And again save your BS for someone that doesn't have firsthand experience. You come as one of those people that will come up with excuse after excuse (no matter how ridiculous).
10bvi0i,,j4gzqh0,Umm, you know what nevermind. People with their heads up their ass are a dime a dozen and I got better things to do.
10bvi0i,,j4hkz5x,Don't message me cuz your mad about a comment dude, I don't believe you were ever homeless the way your so confidently wrong
10bvi0i,,j4j21tw,How do you get a bank account?
10bvi0i,,j4j2sbv,Years ago federal laws were passed forcing banks to create a tier of checking accounts for people with poor credit and other issues. They used to be called 2nd chance accounts. Some people can't get an account because they screwed over their previous bank. They are on the Chexsystem database. You can Google which banks don't check that.
10bvi0i,,j4j5xox,No, I mean if you don‚Äôt have an address- like literally no local address to give.
10bvi0i,,j4j6gj3,Go to a homeless service center. They will give you a homeless declaration or some equivalent document to take to the DMV. In many states this gets you a free State ID. Different jurisdictions have different procedures... As far as an address; it will be the same as the center's.
10bvi0i,,j4jxx1p,This will work for a bank account?
10bvi0i,,j4knph2,How do you birth certificate for free?
10bvi0i,,j4ele8j,You don't know the person's situation so it's not good to judge. $11 may be hard to get for some.  Also, did you suggested for me to do something illegal? Funny...
10bvi0i,,j4fjuh3,Bruh. Talk your bs to someone who hasn't been homeless and doesn't know better. It's 11 fucking dollars. If you can't come up on $11 a month then you are the laziest person on the entire planet.
10bvi0i,,j4hkkg8,Come to my little podunk town that DOESNT HAVE PLANET FITNESS and shut your fucking cock holster
10bvi0i,,j4fl60g,You're pathetic, you know that? You're full of shit. Sorry ass excuse of a human being.
10bvi0i,,j4f2ax0,It's illegal to sell food stamps btw. And most don't even get that much unless they have children. Be mindful of what you say online, especially about things you don't seem to have knowledge about. Equally, people can't do laundry if they don't have access to water. Let alone the water being clean, and that isn't including the cost of soap.
10bvi0i,,j4fk78z,>It's illegal to sell food stamps btw.  In many jurisdictions it is also illegal to panhandle. Your point?  >And most don't even get that much unless they have children.  If they are getting less then they are getting less because of income (a government check) so problem solved...   >mindful of what you say online, especially about things you don't seem to have knowledge about.  Among other duties; I've done thousands of SNAP applications while working at a homeless service center. You bums are amazing with the ability to always find excuses, even fake ones.
10bvi0i,,j4fkzn0,No one said shit about panhandling. I don't think you understand that you need an address to do most fucking things. If you worked at a homeless service center then you should know better, and you should be treating those better, shouldn't you? I feel bad for anyone who had to deal with you. Probably why a lot of folks can't get help, huh? Watch who you call a bum, I work a job and am actively looking to get another on top. Most don't like to be homeless suprise surprise, and it isn't a choice that many gravitate toward as it makes everything a hundred times harder. This was a post about someone commenting on a smell, and you suggested something illegal and your comment was not helpful or comforting in the slightest. I'm glad you can come up with the $11 for a gym membership that a lot of others struggle with, and no it isn't because of drugs or not working hard enough. People like you are the reason shit will never get better for many like this, because you don't understand a thing yet feel as though you must comment on such problems.
10bvi0i,j4j0txp,,Because those people are self-absorbed who don‚Äôt have self awareness.  Edit: But there really is nothing you can do about it.  You just have to accept that they are damaged people. There is no way anyone can teach these people to be better. Life will be their teacher.
10bu8u9,j4clve6,,Formerly homeless, currently housed person here. I'm lucky enough to have a work-from-home job with colleagues that I like. I'd much rather spend 8 hours a day working and earning money than wandering the streets, hiding from the police, or sitting in church services in a shelter. Took me 2 hours this morning to run errands, and now I have food for the week and a couple of new books to read. This afternoon, I'm going to put a load of clothes in the washer and sit out on my balcony and read.  I'm not miserable. I'm so damned happy to be out of that shelter where I was told when to sleep, when to get up, when to eat, what to eat ... being forced to sit through evangelical church services 3 hours a day ... No, I'm not miserable. I'm much better off than when I was homeless.
10bu8u9,j4dnw2f,,I'm housed.  I would rather work 60 hours a week than go back to being houseless. Sure, it has its issues, but I don't have to worry about heat, cold, the rain, safety, the ability to cook, etc.  Things are tough all over. Most everyone struggles, but comparing the two is apples to oranges.
10bu8u9,j4cub8k,,> Housed people are very miserable, in a way, they're also kind of homeless because they spend most of their waking hours away from home. Working in soul crushing and traumatizing jobs. People treat them like shit, bosses treat them like shit, they go through a psychologival 5 days a week.  This is only true of *some* jobs. And some people are self-employed!  **And** some homeless people *work!* So if work is so terrible, they're getting the worst of both worlds.  > The two weeks left, they have so many obligations to fulfill, and then again back to hell, back to slavery. They collapse mentally every day. This can't go on forever, at some point, they won't be able to continue functioning like this.  People typically retire because they got old. If you like your job, you won't get sick of it.  I also think calling work "slavery" is problematic for numerous reasons. Before "jobs" existed, people still had to work to fill their bellies. When people started specializing, perhaps Alice went hunting but relied on Bob to maintain her weaponry, while Bob didn't go hunting and so relied on Alice to keep him fed, but nobody was forcing them to do this. Unless you're suggesting we all try to return to a hunting and gathering existence (which cannot possibly support even a tiny fraction of Earth's population of eight billion humans!) I don't think that makes sense.  Other advantages "housed" people (this includes apartments... I think "unhoused" is a stupid term) - you don't have to worry about where you will use the toilet, you don't have to shower in a gym (or in a stream, or not at all!). Privacy. Electricity. A generally safe place to keep your stuff so it doesn't get stolen.
10bu8u9,,j4f4qhi,Most common jobs in America are in customer service jobs, which means taking abuse from the public many hours a day many days a week. No one can like this job even if they wanted to. Housed people don't really enjoy their privacy if they have to spend most of their waking hours on working for a boss.
10bu8u9,,j4gsu28,A friend of mine works customer service for AA and genuinely enjoys it. She's still working at 75. She enjoys her home very much too.
10bu8u9,,j4mfdhu,This is simply untrue. Life is what you make it. If you are a miserable hater then that is what will come to you.
10bu8u9,,j4p36zf,Or maybe you are what life makes of you.
10bu8u9,,j4prp70,Acting like you don‚Äôt have any choices. That‚Äôs okay. Blame everyone else if that makes you feel better. I worked in service for years. People can be jerks that‚Äôs true. I have no control over their behavior so didn‚Äôt take it personally. If you just react to everything you will never find peace.
10bu8u9,,j4qagpq,You can't just not to care when people hurt you.
10bu8u9,,j4u85as,You don't have any choices. That's how people end up homeless or working minimum wage, one mistake away from homelessness.
10bu8u9,j4e55g8,,Currently housed.   Yeah having safety and shelter is terrible. Totally miss wondering around aimlessly, carrying every thing I owned, needed excuses for being inside.   Being constantly outside in the elements was a dream come true. There is no way I increased my chances of skin cancer from the 2nd and 3rd degree burns. The tip of left my ear is gone because I didn't want to come inside during that snow storm. *I mean, who would?*   The best part was definitely the ~~long dark and lonely~~ nights being fully aware that if anyone decided to assault me I'd have no real way to legally defend myself.   Constantly being tired from barely sleeping was GREAT for all parts of my health. Always made my best decisions while sleep deprived.  Also if an assault landed in me getting pregnant I knew I'd have no way to take care of my body and what I'd be ***forced*** to carry. Being at much higher risk of complications that could kill both me and the thing inside of me. And if I was unlucky enough to survive, and what was forced I to carry did not, knowing that I could face serious charges. But none of those probabilities ever kept me awake and paranoid ever.
10bu8u9,j4eb8bw,,Sorry but this makes no sense. Being homeless sucks.
10bu8u9,j4d57ao,,Being homeless isn't that  bad if people would leave you alone.
10bu8u9,,j4j4vl1,Being homeless in a city is a nightmare and not knowing how to survive in the wilderness is a nightmare, so there is no middle ground.
10bu8u9,,j4kbq71,There tons of YouTube videos that can teach you how to survive in the wilderness. Its not as hard as you think.
10bu8u9,j4c9i1q,,Ha! How about they come out here with me for a month? They'll learn really fast how nice it is to have a home. There are definitely struggles maintaining a job and a place, but it's nothing like the struggle of homelessness.
10bu8u9,j4hiblv,,This is ridiculous. You have a terrible attiude. If you like being homeless and unemployed then that is on you. I have a job I love..and a house....I worked from home solely for 3 years but now I have a hybrid where I go into the office 15 minutes away twice a week. Work at home 3 days. Full benefit package and lots of PTO. I am not sure the point of this post? You have to want out of homelessness. If you are ok wirth your situation then good for you.
10bu8u9,,j4u8drz,Your case is the exception, not the rule.
10bu8u9,,j4vfowo,Not even. Why would you assume that most houses people hate their jobs and hate their lives? You may hate your life and you obviously are OK with being homeless and that‚Äôs your choice. Most people will tell you no matter what job they have it‚Äôs better than being homeless
10bu8u9,j4cbuy1,,With all that, its still better than being homeless. Believe me. There is a reason people work so hard to be housed. I hope everyone eventually get there.
10bu8u9,j4d0x1o,,Tell me how it is. Homeless on the streets. Some weeks I work 70 hours a week. Tell me how it is. I walk often too stay warm, and I start nodding off to sleep!! But pls go on and on about how miserable it is for you too have a home
10bu8u9,j4floa3,,Absolutely not. Having a secure place where you can sleep and store your belongings is infinitely better than being out on the streets. When I was homeless, every day was a struggle and there was always the lingering possibility I could get assaulted/robbed/arrested/killed. I would much rather be under a roof with a lock on the door than be back out on the streets.
10bu8u9,j4djfdm,,Currently housed, and it really does feel like I live for work. Like, six days a week I'm trapped in a shop using all my creative energy to make other people money. I'm too emotionally and physically drained to enjoy my down time, and the seventh day I only want to sleep.  When I was homeless, I was driven and had time to pursue the things I wanted. I published zines and comix, I freelanced for tickets, and wasn't afraid to steal shit when I needed it. It's nice to have somewhere comfortable now, but fuck I miss feeling unbound.
10bu8u9,,j4j57rl,Why don‚Äôt you change jobs?

10bu8u9,j4eo5pn,,Hope you get to feeling better OP.   While yeah some may be miserable having to do the grind a roof, bed, shower just being able to sit down its worth it   Again hope you get to feeling better.
10bu8u9,j4ig1if,,The implication that people experiencing homelessness do not also spend much of their time miserable at jobs they hate us pretty stigmatizing and offensive. Plenty of the people living in my shelter work more hours than I do.
10bu8u9,j4j3okd,,Pretty much. I always call it voluntary slavery cause you make yourself go there and expose yourself to that toxicity. No one force you, but yet you have to to survive this fake construct.
10bu8u9,j4mexzp,,Living in a van.   Who are these people?  I did it for all my life until I retired. I never felt like this. Is this screed merely an excuse to not try to do better?  I hope you get well and the clouds on your brain part so you can see.
10bu8u9,j4f8xfw,,You have to filter the water
10bu8u9,j4kcq17,,So, my apologies, I'm autistic, so I have difficulties expressing my thoughts. So, please let me know if what I've written doesn't make any sense, I'll try my best to clarify.   The suffering you're referring to isn't the fault of housing, it's capitalism.  Because here's the thing, if you didn't need to work your ass off at a dehumanizing job to own a home, would having that home be that awful? There's nothing inherently oppressive about having a home (quite the opposite, actually). Rather, the fear of losing housing is used by the wealthy (employers, landlords, ect), to extract your time and labor.   At the same time, the homeless are not spared from this oppression. They aren't free to create their own housing, nor are they free to own a home of their liking. They are forced to survive without shelter, and they are shamed for it. Society seeks to end their existence, by depriving them of basic human needs. Survival is an all consuming job that provides no pay check for betterment. Not to mention, many homeless do have jobs, but those jobs don't have a livable wage. And yes, many of those jobs would be considered an actual form of slavery. Ultimately, the hard work of the homeless is done while being oppressed by cops, and society at large. Often by vulnerable groups of people (PoC, disabled, victims of violence, elderly, pregnant individuals, ect). The suffering and death of the homeless is used to keep housed workers obedient, lest they endure the same.   We need to get rid of the mentality of "It could've been worse!" cause it doesn't do anything to improve our lives. Chuck it out, and replace it with, "It could be better," cause shit needs to get better.
10bu8u9,,j4kg0f2,The problem is that we live in a society. People have to get very uncomfortable to make the rest of society comfortable, people have to risk their lives to save others. No one can just rest and do nothing at all, we all have to contribute. I wouldn't mind doing stuff but it's just the over high pace of things and the unrealistic expectations workplaces have from their employers. I don't know if there can be a better society or what we have now is the best of all possible worlds. Either way, I hope there would be a right to die for people like us, so we could refuse the social contract.
10bu8u9,,j4naqns,I so relate to u. I would sign up for MAID because I can‚Äôt handle most work environments. I definitely don‚Äôt want to die but I can‚Äôt cope with the way things are set up. I feel like life is mostly a daily nightmare and I‚Äôd leave if I could. That would be a relief and tragic but I‚Äôve lived long enough at 45.
10bs50o,j4cyxti,,That's crazy praying that all of you get some shelter from the cold
10bs50o,,j4eyr88,I'm thankful that when I was homeless, I had a spot in a shelter during the time it was cold. Others weren't so lucky- that first Christmas, there was a Christmas Eve church service i attended, and part of it was remembering the homeless that had died in the past year. I don't remember any causes being mentioned, but some may have been due to the weather (hot or cold).  A lot of groups/people did offer cans of Sterno to those sleeping outside (or maybe inside, but without proper heating), and I imagine that helped at least a little
10bs50o,j4c3cbe,,They shut down our tent city just in time for the shit weather.   Freezing  us out. It‚Äôs -8 here today.  No shelter from 730 am to 730 pm.  Library‚Äôs only open 4 hours.   And my shit is still wet from yesterdays storm.  Fuuuuck
10bs50o,,j4c6zma,Was it shut down because it was illegal or the property owner wanted it gone?

Yeah sometimes the end goal is to hurt someone but it's a mental illness issue, people can be really traumatized and angry or it's a compulsion or something.  Social welfare is so underfunded for the need, people should never have to choose between domestic violence and homelessness.
10bredl,j4bou02,,Now that you point it out‚Ä¶I‚Äôve noticed that myself‚Ä¶the public really has become quite grotesque overall. With exceptions of course.
10bredl,j4c6iqm,,I'm not so picky as being on the street often finds me messing up public space, like using public gardens as toilets :) It's not my fucking fault they casually lock public toilets for this or that, and sometimes post a note "the nearest public toilets are in Texas", yeah, fuck you too :)
10bredl,,j4cap0e,Yikes, I've never encountered anything that insulting as that sign. During covid though when there was a mass trend of bathroom closures (and non-reopenings) I would find that you would drive through entire counties, and you pick a store or a restaurant off the freeway, and there would be no public restrooms, key or other wise. It forces people to go where they can.
10bredl,,j4ci394,Yeah, the Covid days were wicked! Might explain why recently some areas reported a decline in homeless population, they killed us off!
10bredl,j4czjti,,Feel your pain. Was just griping about this today. While cleaning a bathroom in a dollar general I go to sometimes. Even when not outdoors I clean up after myself.  Clean public sink/toilet a bit. Pick up trash while out walking around etc. Plenty of those responsible are housed. Just inconsiderate, lazy, entitled, whatever.  When it comes to us homeless, yeah it's important if only out of self interest to leave things as clean or better. Hear many griping about nobody wanting "us" around, same people leave the areas they occupy a trash heap.  Oh well just figure I'll keep trying to do my small part to make things better. Not like it even takes a massive amount of time or effort.
10bm91h,j4azuxg,,Rehab?
10bm91h,,j4c4s59,I just got out of jail then had to complete a rehab program after I was released. I've got a little over 2 months sober which is why I'm tryna leave, If I stay here ima just end up drinking again.   Just wanna get a boring job and a small apartment where I can keep to my self
10bm91h,j4bvriz,,Sober home.  Homelessness isn't where it's at.

10bm91h,,j4cgpa9,Cambodia or somewhere I dunno.
10bm91h,,j4d5shr,Rental prices in Missouri seem like they are on the cheaper side.
10bm91h,j4cf7fw,,Florida. Get a job picking fruit or something
10bm91h,,j4mityu,Florida is too expensive housing wise
10bm91h,j4bl86p,,Live with relatives or friends
10bm91h,,j4c5g6f,Been living with relatives just not very comfortable with the situation. They have been more than accommodating, But I been super depressed and letting days slip by without getting much done so I don't wanna fall into the cycle of drinking again and just crashing on someone's couch.
10bm91h,,j4d66km,It's much easier on people if you aren't sleeping there. Just ask them to utilize some storage for some things that you need as a lifeline. Then figure out somewhere else to sleep.  Having a safe place to store extra clothes, supplies, Etc, can be very meaningful for a person in your situation.  This option is not always open, but when it is it makes things much simpler for those who are assisting you.
10bm91h,,j4dz9mh,Man I wish I had SOMEONE, ANYONE who would open their door and offer actual help.  My parents live just 10 miles away in a house with empty bedrooms and fridges full of food, yet I'll be sleeping in a tent tonight in the nonstop wind zone and 20 degree temps.

10be6ev,j4ylwdb,,Sedgewick (Benefits) did this to me.  Applied for STD, they took their time, and I got fired because my leave ran out.  And they denied the claim.  I had no idea I could appeal it after being fired, maybe?  Half a decade later, I'm still butthurt about Sedgewick. Losing that job was devastating.  Not from PA, so can't comment on help services out there.  But, I would highly suggest *start making noise* about your benefits.  I get it if you don't have anything tieing you to where you are, but it's gonna be a whole lot easier with money coming in.  PS- Priorities as a human being:  Shelter, food, water, clothes, etc.  Bills/Debt is secondary.
10be6ev,,j4zdl1s,Do you mean make noise with the long term disability claim? Oh I‚Äôve been doing everything I possibly can. Every time I call I get ‚Äúsorry this person is busy with another client‚Äù and if I call and actually talk to someone I get ‚ÄúI have to transfer you to your case manager‚Äù and then I get the same voicemail. I keep requesting my medical records and can see from the portal for the insurance company the benefits are through that they don‚Äôt have the records I have. I spent time last weekend uploading each records page out of 89 for one of my doctors and it is still saying ‚Äúinvalid authorization‚Äù from December 28. Nothing changed. Like they didn‚Äôt even look at what I uploaded. I got even more records in the mail today that they need. Have no clue how to get them over to them since they won‚Äôt answer and feel it would be a waste of time to upload another 89 pages individually.  I know it would be so much easier with money coming in.  I would be absolutely surprised if I get denied. I will appeal if so believe that. This is through New York Life, life insurance, medical benefits. What I have going on with my health is not a preexisting condition which if it was then I would be denied. They are just being extremely difficult with handling the records. It‚Äôs like I have to be a lawyer and fight for my benefits. It‚Äôs messed up.
10bccy8,j49r5nx,,I feel ya‚Ä¶unfortunately, there‚Äôs going to be a lot more bs though I think.  ‚ÄúHomelessness‚Äù, has been politicized for sometime now and what I‚Äôve experienced in my community, seen and heard from both campaign volunteers and ads, spoken with social workers, shelter admin, social services/community action committee employees, keeping up with local news stories, and reading through the latest local report with data collected from several main service providers in the area on homelessness‚Ä¶  Homeless are being used as a way to shift blame to because they are easy targets for society to pick on and pick off.  We should love each other‚Ä¶but some live to hate and love doing so.
10bccy8,,j49thg7,Agreed. I feel it's just best to put out there. Just the fact that someone downvotes legit posts and accuses without any background research is concerning. There is no such thing as not looking homeless or like a vagabond. There such be no penalty about being positive despite a tough situation. I'll be straight up but there will be national media opportunities to help the cause. If outsiders see negativity not gonna look good. The fact is we can all boost one another.
10bccy8,,j49tvmz,I like your positivity. After all, we are all here and in this thing together‚Ä¶one way or another.
10bccy8,,j49uo2i,Appreciate you ‚ù§Ô∏è I've done extremely emotional sensitive content so not gonna shy away. But there are some on here who probably would like to receive support yet hold back due to a judgemental segment. We upvote basic pics yet downvote others for posting more substantial stuff with accusations of doing vids to be imposters.
10bccy8,j4a5sd4,,Funnily enough I almost caved to that line of work. I even took some feet pics bc I couldn‚Äôt bear the idea of showing my body like that. Underwear maybe if asked? Feet pics? Where to even start? Did some heavy research on the feet pics thing though, when knowing we were facing impossible odds. Never did pull the trigger. Too chicken.   This said. I have no idea what you mean.
10bccy8,j4aqm7h,,Alright. Here's a baseline. For the overwhelming majority of human history, Mankind was homeless. We descend from hunter gatherers. Civilization is the invention of the last 7000 years or so. There is nothing shameful, or dishonorable about being a "gypsy." Indeed, it can be convincingly argued that it is humanity's natural state.
10b9bis,j48whxu,,Go to a parking garage. I am assuming you don‚Äôt have blankets and that is why you need to run the car all night. Inside of a parking garage you will be much warmer than if your car was sitting outside.
10b9bis,,j48x75j,I have a sleeping bag that keeps my body warm, but my nose is too clogged to breathe through so with my mouth open all night and how cold it is here (it‚Äôs been close to freezing or freezing every night) it‚Äôs making the infection worse
10b9bis,,j48xjq3,If you have a beanie you can put that over your head. I don‚Äôt know how much it would help if you don‚Äôt want/can‚Äôt block your nose. there are masks that have openings in just the mouth area and it will cover your full head maybe one of those could help.
10b9bis,,j48z685,I think my partner has a balaclava and a beanie, so I could definitely see if I can borrow them! I‚Äôm hoping the antibiotics are going to start helping
10b9bis,,j49906s,I hope so too, good luck and stay warm üíú
10b9bis,,j49ck2z,You likely have no way to disinfect the vehicle either, like wipes and or sanitizer correct, access to a clothes washer/dryer?  You may try asking for these or at the least, if you luck out and get a sunny day‚Ä¶perhaps park out in the sun and allow the UV rays to do something hopefully. (No idea how effective it would be, seems if I recall it depends on a variety of factors.)  Might help a little is all I‚Äôm saying and then pop open some windows and let things air out if you can.  Drink plenty of water and just do your best, don‚Äôt need any secondary health conditions/infections creeping up on ya.
10b9bis,,j48xlrj,Could also get a beanie and cut holes where are you need your nose and mouth to stick out
10b9bis,j490equ,,Being cold or hot isn't going to make you sicker. You may feel physically worse, but the strep won't worsen. It generally takes about 48 hours after your first dose of antibiotics for you to start feeling better. Antibiotics don't help with fever. Do you have Tylenol or something like that you can take?  Also, strep won't cause your nose to clog or run. You may have allergies or a cold on top of your strep. You might try some nasal spray or just tough out that part.  Hope you feel better soon!
10b9bis,,j492h0r,I‚Äôve been on antibiotics for 2 days, and I take the max dose of Tylenol and ibuprofen already for a back injury, and even with that the fever‚Äôs been rough. I know as long as I don‚Äôt get hypothermic temperature theoretically isn‚Äôt a problem, but with an infection in my throat the cold air is definitely keeping the fever from actually helping burn out the infection.  A friend is going to get my some Sudafed, so hopefully the stuffy nose won‚Äôt be much of a problem anymore, but yeah, I probably have a cold on top of the strep
10b9bis,,j494olx,Do you have a way to take your temperature? If it gets over 101, you should go back to the doctor.
10b9bis,,j494y85,I don‚Äôt have a thermometer :/
10b9bis,j4ahkv6,,The best place you can be during times like this is in a hospital. I used to go find an ER and sit there and/or hit patient waiting rooms during the day. I'd sit and pretend to watch TV. I felt safer there than outside when I really felt sick. That was pre-Covid though.
10b9bis,j4a93ah,,Make a little fort/tent in your car to keep your nose warm and air coming in from another area. Also theraflu is amazing with strep throat. Chew on garlic or swallow cloves hole. Sweet and spicy soup extra spicy. Those 3 things gets my strep gone over night.

10b6dcp,,j492mu8,Whats going on in Las Vegas?
10b6dcp,,j4937us,Solid weather for most of year and centralized services which are actually city funded. Very easy to access resources.
10b6dcp,,j4plmxf,what is a good shelter there? preferably one that doesn't kick you out during the day?
10b6dcp,,j4qs3uz,I don't think the mission kicks out in the day. In fact have to be in by 3 unless working after that time.
10b6dcp,,j5qrayy,Courtyard is open 24/7 come and go whenever. Although gotta get in line at around 8pm I think to get a bed for sure. It's rare for that to happen from what I've heard. Only slept there 5 times or so. Only use it for mail.
10b6dcp,,j5qqw8m,Yeah the main one (Courtyard) is open 24/7. Come and go as you please.
10b6dcp,,j72jcay,what are the cross streets? or general area? do they keep men and women separate? do you know if there's a lot of assaults that happen there? that's my biggest fear.
10b6dcp,,j86ynem,Yes they keep them separate. Main concern is illness. Crammed together. I purposely roamed the streets.
10b6dcp,j494o7w,,Shelters are full in most cities. Good luck.

10b6dcp,j48pvv7,,I'm from the San Francisco Bay, tried to move to Oakland lost everything. Start them in Madera ended up in Fresno, I didn't look to see what gender you are but the Poverello House compound saved us, Naomi's house. Before that we did 30 days at the Madera Rescue Mission. And ended up doing another 20 days after our time in Fresno. Madera you can do 30 days on 30 days off.
10b6dcp,,j48rl0e,Okay so you're female. This is hard but the Stars aligned when we showed up. If you go to Poverello, called the Pov, and you show up there are two lines you have to be there by 3:00 p.m. just chilling in the curb in all of the street they'll start forming two lines the one to the West is for people who stayed the previous night and had signed to keep their bed. The one to the east are for people looking for a bed. Once a spot opens up you're golden you have a bed. As long as you follow the rules and are in that line by 4:15 or something you always have a bed. They do have a shed over in the village that if there's not a spot in the house yet you can stay in one of the sheds add your next in line you just have to show up everyday. At least they have a doctors on site and dentist so it's not like you have to travel for appointments like that so you waiting the line to get in if they're not taking any then you're going to have to try and sleep outside on the street which is really scary or if you can get a hotel room. Got to get up early in the morning break down your bed line up and they close down the house during the day so you go down to the Catholic Women's Center a few Doors Down and that's where you hang out until meals, you could do laundry there. Across the street is where they serve meals. It's quite the social scene in there, they have a couple trailers where they work on getting people housing, Mental Health. There's a lady who's been in Naomi's house since the beginning. She's not very high functioning but she makes sure she's in that line. Some of the most damage people are ones who were children when their family was killed through some violence home invasion. It's heartbreaking to see them talk to themselves but I think just about anybody would throw down to help protect them should anyone decide to mess with them
10b6dcp,,j48rz2q,I'm kind of out of it right now cptsd. So you show up every day get there early get in the line of people looking for a bed, if there are new new openings they say sorry ladies and you got to take off. If things make a shift and they have a spot for you it would either be in the sheds, which sleeps rough but at least the next bed in the House available would be yours. After that show of everyday and you'll always have a bed there's no time limit
10b6dcp,,j49skp5,Thank you for your replies!. I'm a male actually. Could you please tell me more about these medical/dental services?. Like, are they free?. Do you have to do a lot of paperwork, get on a list, wait in line or can you just walk in and get your needs taken care of?.
10b6dcp,,j4b0ig9,My apologies about the gender mix-up. Let me see if I can find the info for you. I stayed there for a few months and they would make an announcement that if you needed dental work to come get a ticket. I had a crown put in. They also did extractions. I did not end up needing a doctor, so I'm not quite sure but if you just asked any of the staff they would tell you.
10b6dcp,j4a459c,,Seattle is pretty decent lately if you can hang with the amount of dangerous homeless, addicts, etc there are a lot of services available right now. Not necessarily shelters but a lot of federal funding being made available for housing and you will not go hungry up here unless you're not trying to eat. Weather isn't great obviously but it's winter and there's places with worse weather where people do just fine. Easy to get a job up here too honestly, they have programs specifically to put homeless people to work in the trades and in food service but it's not hard to just get a job on your own either. Farestart, work source, and the trade unions will take you on too as long as you're committed. There's also showers all over town, free fridges, food not bombs distros weekly, local groups and shelters that distribute sleeping bags and tents. The bus system is really good too.

From my W Coast experience being homeless, being manipulated and bullied by gang affiliated people is the worst treachery. Don't believe anyone. They tell stories that aren't true, spread disinformation, and press-gang people into behaving in ways outside their nature.  Second greatest threat, people with homes who hang out with homeless people. Be wary.
10b4uca,j487qoc,,It's definietly doable. It really depends on what city you're located in and what kind of day the bus driver is having.  Your best bet is on the train/trolley, assuming your city has transit like that.
10b4uca,j494jdx,,Hmm
10b44ah,j49aqeh,,A major one that is missed in a lot of packages is medication - things like pain relief, UTI medications, antibiotic cremes, bandaids, etc. Many of them come in bulk single packs. Depending on your location heat/cold packs (reusable or one-time use, I use to let people warm up/freeze theirs when I ran a gas station).   Fleece can be okay depending on where you are, but cheap fleece ones can get really damp and moldy in the wrong climate, or frustratingly warm in others. Also depends on if they‚Äôre going to someone with a camp or are in the open. Someone with a camp or access to temporary housing can maintain blankets that soak water/stay wet longer much easier. I personally prefer to make and use dual sided with a soft wool on one side and a water resistant material on the other. Great because you can have the resistant on the outside if you‚Äôre sitting, or facing down as a buffer from the ground cold/damp if you‚Äôre lying. Reinforced stitching and leaving one side unsewn was great because I could use them as a sleeping bag or cover, stuff it with pillows, or use it to carry other items. Blankets are always good though, so don‚Äôt let any of that deter you if fleece is where it‚Äôs at for you! Just information from my experience.
10b44ah,,j4b8f4j,Thanks a lot!
10b44ah,j4a9ifp,,You rock!  Esp the blanket pack idea.
10b44ah,,j4b8g7p,Thank you, trying to do what I can!
10b3a0x,j493cyn,,Even housed I'm not exactly living large and I came out of the shelter with very little by way of clothing. Limited budget means I rarely buy anything new unless it's super cheap except for underwear and socks.   I buy any clothing or shoes via thrifts or, online auctions. Or I sometimes get lucky and grab stuff off Freecyle, CL or Buy Nothing. That's just how it is.   Early in 2022 this woman on Freecycle gave me 3 large bags of used clothing. At first I was thrilled because there were a lot of items from Old Navy and GAP and I like their stuff. I was in desperate need of pants and shirts. All I really had was a few tees and some leggings and my leather jackets that I've had forever. But when I actually started going through it a lot of it was in need of repairs or stained.   Fortunately I sew a bit and have a couple of old sewing machines now. I also am pretty good at getting out stains but even so I had to throw out a good third of what this woman gave me because those items were just too messed up to save.   It was just too annoying because I would have NEVER handed someone items like that. That was just pure laziness or some kind of passive aggressive BS, I don't know which.   Anything stained or too ripped up that I can't repair it goes in the rubbish. I wouldn't donate it EVER. It's just too rude.   One thing though for people who think they are doing the homeless a favor by donating their old clothes to a shelter? Anything actually nice might not get into the hands of someone who might truly need it. I have literally seen a whole closet full of very nice clothing be denied to shelter residents. I have seen those clothes bagged and SOLD by staff or taken for their own use.   In a place where some residents were walking around with clothing in rags swith holes in their shoes any donations that were not handed to us directly outside the shelter by church groups would just vanish and we wouldn't see much if any of it. At one point they even forbade that and insisted upon managing any clothing brought for our use so they could control how much and what items we actually got.   Some shelter outfits resell a lot of items meant for residents so please be careful who you donate to and if at all possible please give clothing you don't want directly to homeless people instead of to shelter operators. The smaller shelters may be better about that but the two big ones that I was in didn't hesitate to appropriate donations for other use than for residents.   Under the circumstances it was pretty outrageous but there is a lot of corruption going on, especially with bigger cities, within shelter operations. Just because you donate something does not mean the shelter residents will benefit from it.
10b3a0x,,j49dcmn,A few years ago i was down and i was staying at this shelter/affordable housing place and it turns out some of the staff were stealing residents medications for their own use and it also turns out that one of the top operators was pocketing the donations needed to keep the shelter open, now it's closed and almost 400 people now have nowhere to stay this winter because of the greed of one man.
10b3a0x,,j49ggnz,The staff was stealing meds at the shelter I was at too. One guy even stole someone's new bank card when it arrived in the mail, activated it and helped himself to all of her money. He got caught and she got her money back but it was like REALLY?  They would also steal anything valuable that they could going through the scanners. One woman lost her gold chains. Another had her laptop stolen right in front of her by a guard who took it saying it wasn't allowed. (It was.)   I had mine but I literally locked my bag so they couldn't take it when it went through the scanner and I kept it under my pillow at night, locked to the bed. Took my backpack with me even to the bathroom.   The director of the first shelter I was at left right after I left. Word has it, fired. I'm not surprised. That woman would literally take bags of candy that was brought for residents to enjoy at the holidays and stuff them in her big carry all right in front of us. She'd take it all home with her. She'd give us like one piece and abscond with the rest of it she was so cheap.   Meds vanished nearly every day. A lot of the staff that worked there were ex-homeless or were there working while on probation. They paid them so little that they felt the stealing was justifiable.   The food thing, half rations, and expired food being given to us, that was what really bothered me. I am convinced that the now former director was pocketing money meant for the residents food because when I got to the second shelter the food wasn't much better but there was WAY more of it and we were allowed to eat a lot more, especially at breakfast.   At the first shelter you'd be lucky to get some eggs and one little breakfast sausage OR a little bowl of cereal and maybe a half rotted banana. In the second shelter we got full eggs and 3 sausages, 2 cereal bowls, as many pieces of fruit as we wanted, and there would be waffles or pancakes too a lot of the time.   The first time I saw the breakfast buffet I was like OMG because it was a positive feast compared to what I was used to at the first shelter. Other meals too. You could take 2 meals if you wanted. The food was still rotten for lunch and dinner, same providers, but you could just take extra cereal or waffles or whatever and not starve because you couldn't eat lunch or dinner.   They didn't have a clothes closet there because by then we were actually in hotels but I will bet you that back at the actual shelter they were outfitting people not selling off clothes to resellers. I did lose a pair of boots that came in the mail there though. They just up and vanished and never made it into my hands and the mailman did confirm that someone downstairs did receive them.   I was rather ticked but the person on desk duty that day just denied ever having a package for me that day. I had to let it go but I did rather hope she got horrible blisters and those boots made her absolutely miserable. üëÖ  In my mind you have to be pretty low to steal from homeless people in a shelter. Or to half starve them and give them potentially dangerous food that's out of date and that you have re-tagged as fresh when it's not. To limit old people who need diapers to one or two a day. To steal personal belongings and medications from people who have practically nothing.   It happens though, all the time.
10b3a0x,,j49jhmq,It's telling that those who need help from society the most are preyed upon by those above them. Another thing about this shelter i was at was they would let you store your backpack in a locked room with every one elses bags so it wouldn't get stolen while you slept BUT you could only "check" your bag out between 7am and 730 am and if you didn't get it between then you'd have to get it the next day, it was literally 10 feet from the main office and i didn't know this rule the first time i did it and they weren't gonna give me my bag and at that time i was a rank junkie and my bag was full of clean needles, i shot up maybe 6 times a day but always with clean gear everytime, the day i couldn't get my back pack out from the room 10 feet from the office well it just happened to be sunday, the day the only needle exchange is closed and i would be reaaaaally sick if i couldn't shoot up and i told the staff that's why i needed my bag and if i couldn't get it I'd likely have to shoot up with dirty needles which is something i never did, but i did that day, i went to the spot where me and a bunch of other people i knew shot up and grabbed what i was HOPING was one of MY old needles but realistically it could have been one of a hundred other peoples and i used this needle to shoot my morning shot of dope and get myself well enough to live through the day, i went back and got my bag the next day and told the girl who had denied me my bag the day prior that i had used a dirty needle and likely had hiv or hep c now and all she had to say was well i guess you'll be on time to get your bag next time won't you? I had an hiv test about 7 months later and a HEP C test when i was in a federal psychiatric ward cause i went insane and got locked up and i luckily didn't have any communicable illnesses from using that dirty needle a few times that day but i easily could have. It's crazy how after i got locked up when i got out they put me on disability welfae payments which are like twice as much as regular welfare and helped me get a place to stay and ID and a doctor etc. I guess every homeless person should just get put in jail if they want help getting off the street? It's insane. I have an apartment  ow and have gotten on the methadone program and have been clean since i got out of jail 4 years ago. When i was homeless i was suffering from a severe psychosis basically i had an intense version of a "delusion of reference" that I'd had for years and seeing a psychologist every week for 2 years and doing cognitive behavioral therapy with her for 2 years cured me of this psychosis, ii have other problems I'd rather not explain but i was trying to get help for this psychosis for years and no doctors would help or could help? But i got locked up and it's fixed! Mental health care does not exist unless you are in jail i guess?
10b3a0x,,j4c6z53,The shelter I was at held on to meds but I was lucky as they had it locked securely in a solid built metal cabinet located in an open area next to the main desk with sign in/out sheets for staff AND the person getting their meds. There was also a camera recording that main room as well as one directly on the med cabinet. Roughly 50 peoples worth of meds were locked up there and I never had a problem. My meds included 60 Suboxone a month, plus Adderall, Klonopin, muscle relaxers, gabapentin and then some non-abusable medications. I will admit that I didn't trust my medical marijuana being locked in their but they new I used it so I kept the same $5 bud in a jar the entire time. Occasionally meds were claimed to have disappeared but I know for a fact that a few of those times was homeless people using or selling them and then trying to get them replaced.  I have also been at an awful shelter where "staff" was required to put your stuff in and take out of washer and dryer we weren't allowed to touch and they stole a bunch from me, so much I almost froze to death that winter one night. Some places are so bad.
10b3a0x,,j4c3g0p,Theft from and assault of the homeless, destitute, and sick as well as from  places like shelters and other charities that help the worst off should be punished criminally with extreme prejudice. Stealing clothing/supplies from donations at a shelter, for example, should come with an enhanced penalty just like what should happen to a police officer that breaks the law and violates their duties.  The abuse of authority as well as the abuse and exploitation of the least of a society should not be tolerated.
10b3a0x,,j4c20zj,Companies are also starting to buy up all the used goods and used clothing that would normally go to our poorest. They are shipping it to partners in upcoming third world countries. They can sell the used clothing and goods to middle class folks there and make more money. They are putting thrift stores out of business and shelters/donation boxes are losing sources of used/recycled  things. Its like the companies that buy your used electronics back from you when you upgrade. A used Amazon Kindle might get you $5 maybe $10 tops but they offer free shipping and convenience. People are lazy and now its resold online for $30 where previously it may have been just given away, donated or sold for $15-$20 making for two winners.  Corporations are realizing the demand side of the economy is tight so they are starting to swallow up the entire used goods market.
10b3a0x,,j49wnfm,I second this
10b3a0x,j48n1om,,Classism. People think poor homeless people should be grateful for sh*t stained underwear because it‚Äôs better than nothing. Ridiculous.
10b3a0x,j48mjui,,He was being gross, but he may not have known better.    It's a teaching opportunity.  You shouldn't HAVE to teach people, but sadly sometimes they need that.  "Hey dude.  A bag of new socks is actually our hottest commodity, so please drop by with some of those when you can.  That would be over the top."
10b3a0x,,j4a4q4v,These people actually think homeless people don't deserve new items. They think they don't work so why should they have "luxuries". These people are stingy assholes, they think just coming out in the first place to donate is their gift. They're narcissists.
10b3a0x,,j4c812n,There is also a big difference between a regular person donating dirty and tattered clothing and another homeless person giving you one of their stained/tattered sweatshirts to stay warm. It reminds me of the bible story of the Better lady giving a penny or two and it being worth more than anything else. I have flown a flag before in a wealthy city I was homeless in and gotten more from others in poverty including other homeless and even addicts than anyone that was doing well.
10b3a0x,,j48ond7,Lol, disagree.
10b3a0x,,j48pg6f,Upvoted you anyway.  If you're disagreeing about the socks though: check in with your local shelter's needs.
10b3a0x,,j498jp4,I respect your response to them, but I don‚Äôt think it was worth an upvote. Nothing added to the conversation - sort of like people responding with ‚Äòsame‚Äô.
10b3a0x,,j49dj13,Same
10b3a0x,,j49vsjc,Upvoted.
10b3a0x,,j49j7qz,Why?
10b3a0x,,j4alzxc,Because if somebody is that thoughtless that suggesting its a better idea to bring new socks than old holey ones would flick a lightbulb on then we're talking some type of borderline mental impairment.  If it's not that then it would be extreme cheapness or ungenerousness, and then why also the suggestion would fall flat.   Most people factor these things in when choosing how to approach something effectively I don't think that was done here.
10b3a0x,j4980af,,Many people have incredibly anxiety towards throwing things away and there could be many reasons for it -  a period of need in their own life (see the habits of those that lived through the depression), environmental reasons, or conceptual/memory attachment to things while still not wanting them. While they may (consciously or unconsciously) know that the items aren‚Äôt actually in any condition to be donated, by ‚Äòdonating‚Äô it the burden of actually throwing the item away is transferred  and they can maintain an illusion of it still being around.  Or they‚Äôre just fucking assholes.
10b3a0x,,j49copy,Option 2 please.
10b3a0x,j4987y9,,Experienced something similar in Fort Myers, FL. The Salvation Army was passing out backpacks with a local dumpster company on it. So, now all the homeless were walking around with backpacks saying, "Southwest Waste."  I'm sure they got a tax write-off for the free advertising.
10b3a0x,,j4alpjo,When I was on the streets, our main homeless resource area/program would get huge hauls of misprint, over run, or never collected t-shirts. They were always loud colors, big lettering, or obnoxious logos, etc. I would have rather worn duct tape and rippped it off myself every night than take those shirts. By the end of the day, I'd see so many people walking around in the same shirt. It just made me think of arm bands during WWII.  90% of the homeless looked like anyone else until you put them in a f*n uniform that only the homeless have.   Your story is next level stupidity as a best-case scenario, or absolute cruelty in the worst-case scenario.
10b3a0x,j480a4k,,If it was me,I would just say thanks.And have a sorting area,and big dumpster nearby.Also,I think used clothing can be recycled into rags.
10b3a0x,,j486xv4,One of the factories I worked at had a giant box of rags made from old clothes. I wish I could remember the name of the company that made them. It's a terrific use of old clothes.
10b3a0x,,j48pt3y,As a former mechanic we love em. Hard to com3 by too.
10b3a0x,,j49df6h,We do. We say thank you and through away unusable items
10b3a0x,,j49khpp,Thank you for helping people.
10b3a0x,,j49du1g,Back in the day when i was homeless i used to get old shitty clothes out of salvation army dumpsters or shelters and use the material to patch the holes in my clothes of which there were many(holes i mean)
10b3a0x,j49oecv,,I'm 50-50 on this, the desperate can in fact use broken things, but the public should make an effort to offer to the best of their ability. I got a bit jealous last year when I saved up for an iPhone mini, while a girl on the street was given an iPhone XR for free, which is more desirable than mine in some ways :) kudos to the bougie guy that gave it to her though :)
10b3a0x,j4a3zlg,,Yep, when you're homeless you will see the worst in everyone. When I was homeless, I took a pen from dunkin donuts and when I came back later they refused me service and asked for the pen back. I can't forget the way that white boy mockingly smiled at me.
10b3a0x,,j4c9scn,What was the purpose of specifically adding race to that? Did it add anything to what you were saying or the context?
10b3a0x,j4985ql,,people are trying to offload their junk not help others.   I got a whole lecture about it once because I was unloading a mattress at a thrift place where I had donated a mattress before. I rang the bell started unloading it and they started to yell at me. I sort of figured that no one would try that shit considering they only have 5000 cameras taking your plate info and huge signs saying no dumping. but yeah according to the lecture it is still a huge problem.
10b3a0x,,j49cksd,What are you saying? I don't understand at all.
10b3a0x,,j49fpwr,"No dumping" as in no using the donation area to get rid of your trash items, or in this guys case a mattess he didnt want to take to the dump.  I do think a lot of people get the trash and the donation line blurred.
10b3a0x,,j49gqru,Oh cause the way i read it made it sound like you were the guy trying to dump the mattress and were mad cause you got a lecture.
10b3a0x,,j49rdeh,Lol yeah it sorta sounds like that. Who knows...
10b3a0x,,j4a838l,So you were working there?
10b3a0x,j4aj4yb,,They aren‚Äôt
10b3a0x,j4sqicb,,As someone who comes from a family that can't understand that their hoarding is what causes them to lead terrible lives, the answer lies in that they have no concept of what their stuff is actually worth.     They hold onto mountains of formerly expensive furniture and clothing thinking its worth big dollars because that's what they paid for it, when the reality is that unless that item is new, in-demand, and on a store shelf, its worthless. They hold onto chandeliers, dresses, appliances like blenders and toasters, chairs with a leg missing, thinking that they are still worth the 300$ something dollars they paid for each of these items when they were new. But once they have to downsize/move, all of sudden they realize that no one wants to buy their 20 year old prom dress second hand, or that chair with the broken leg they still own, as all of these items can be acquired at the local thrift store with better convenience for the buyer and at single digit dollar amounts that pale in comparison to the original purchase price. And when the thrift store tells them that their stuff isn't donatable due to age/damage, they refuse to believe it, as that would put them at a near 600$ loss for what they originally paid for these now worthless items.     Their solution? Give it away to "someone who'll appreciate it". I.e. dump this problem on someone else so I don't have to pay for a dumpster. As according to them, "this stuff is still worth at least half of what I paid for it. Look at it, its practically still new!" As they show you that 20 year old prom dress with the stains on it. Unable to comprehend that not even the homeless are going to want to lug around a stained, or even new prom dress formerly worth 300$ (Because what would you even do with it if your homeless? You can't even attend interviews in it, and it'll get ruined at the bottom of your pack. Its dead weight at that point for a population that mainly lives mobile).      Not to mention even new things of value, like a car engines and fine oak dressers that they think are of value to the homeless to sell, are also worthless to donate, as no homeless person even has a place to store these things until they find a buyer, so what is it to them other than more dead weight? (Especially when it comes to things like old couches and furniture. Yes, your sofa only has a small tear on it and is perfectly good, but whose going to buy and old couch from the 90's off your for 100$ when Ikea will sell you one new for 200$ minus the hassle of bartering? Hell, how's a homeless person supposed to sell a couch?)   And so the charity center then begrudgingly either takes their offer or tosses it for them. The hoarder/Donater then walks away feeling stellar with themselves as they've given away what they view as a 1000$ dollar deal for free to their local homeless, who can obviously make fantastic use out of it. When then reality is not even the homeless want your old suit with a missing collar piece or old wedding dress with wine sunk into it, as although these items are expensive to acquire, for what it will cost to restore them (150$ something dollar alterations), nobody shopping at the local homeless shelter could ever afford to, or has the resources to re-store/repair them. And so they will wait until they are no longer homeless to go buy these types of items new from the store, leaving the donated goods to wind up right where you'd expect, the trash.
10b2hzd,j4l03ye,,Is it mostly physical jobs?
10b2hzd,,j4l0laf,Yeah. I'd say warehouse is the most common by far. But within each gig there might be tasks which aren't so physical like packing a box in an assembly style setup.
10b2hzd,j49klcm,,Does it work even if you don't have a SSN?
10b2hzd,,j4l0wtv,Yes you'd need one. During registration they ask for it because either you're doing a W2 or 1099 kinda job.
10b2hzd,j4iyf3t,,Is there a background check involved? I know a similar thing called Tasker makes you pay for a $25 background check before you can work.
10b2hzd,,j4iynsx,Nope. Some temp jobs might be drug tested. They'll say so in description. Although has never happened to me. I heard some people say it's only for stuff other than thc
10b2hzd,,j4iyu3z,Awesome, thanks for the info!
10b2hzd,,j4izb27,You're welcome. Anytime üëç
10b2hzd,j4m9tc5,,Have you tried a CG?
10b2hzd,,j4mgdna,Great idea. I haven't. Kinda forgot it existed. Lemme give it a go üëç Appreciate input
10b2hzd,,j4mgn9s, No problem
10b2hzd,,j4qpdx3,What's that,?
10avdhs,j47v0j2,,This is a really kind way to show someone they're seen and they matter. I'm thinking that some of the kids at r/runaway would particularly appreciate a hot meal.
10avdhs,,j4a5mnq,Thanks for the insight, I‚Äôll share over that way.
10aq5oj,j45mrt6,,Definitely go to the shelter if they do try something set up a tent near the woods or forest try to isolate yourself
10aq5oj,,j45n1hn,I figured sleeping in a tent alone and far away from that such place would be much better for myself üò¨
10aq5oj,j45n2l9,,Yeah go to the shelter if you're going to be homeless you just got to be homeless you don't want to turn of recluse living in green belts. And keep being The Happy Guy it'll help you out.
10aq5oj,,j45n5xa,Welp, looks like I‚Äôm doomed either way. LMAO üòú
10aq5oj,,j45nj0v,Yep that is the way it goes. Fortunately enough i have a car to sleep in for this round of homelessness in my life. It makes a huge difference. But I've definitely done my shelter time as well I would recommend just not really talking to a lot of people and to go to work at like a day labor place or whatever you can do on a consistent basis. It really helps out with life in general having money and stuff but also it makes the staff members like you because the majority of people just sit on their ass all day so if you're one of the ones that gets up and works you will get preferential treatment in the shelter.
10aq5oj,,j45ny5k,Hmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have a job. I have my own SSI and EBT because I‚Äôm deaf. I plan to go back to school but now it‚Äôs too late because Spring semester already began and I would have to wait to sign up for classes until this Summer at least. I don‚Äôt plan to stay there allllll day. I could just walk around in downtown and use those shops like Starbucks that have free WiFi to pass my time‚Ä¶ But that‚Äôs pretty much my plan in nutshell ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10aq5oj,,j45o82d,I don't know where you are but here in San Antonio there's so many homeless people at the shelter you really want to get the staff members on your side it helps out a ton. But I guess all that stuff's just Regional.
10aq5oj,,j45oe5u,I‚Äôm here in Sacramento, CA, but thank you for telling me straight so I can be mentally prepared. Maybe I‚Äôll have to stow away my iPad bag away somewhere else first before I plan to head to the shelter and use my iPad when I need it‚Ä¶.
10aq5oj,,j45o4lz,Shit, I have a iPad that‚Äôs almost 12 inches big in my expensive looking leather bag. My entire life is in my iPad, so If they stole it or damage it, I could be verrrrrry screwed
10aq5oj,,j45ocnt,They will definitely steal it the absolute first chance they get. Your cell phone your headphones anything of any value will be stolen the second you let it out of your sight. I would put your iPad in your backpack and never ever take it out at the shelter ever
10aq5oj,,j45ofia,When I was in the shelter I was able to find two people that were decent people and we were able to watch after each other's shit when someone needed to take a shower or go to the bathroom or something. Definitely want to see about finding someone like that but you have to be careful because people will trick you and then steal your shit.
10aq5oj,,j45ole1,That‚Äôs nice that you were able to find two decent people who can watch out for each other. Cool to know that not all is lost or gloom in that men‚Äôs shelters
10aq5oj,,j45osmv,The shelter's here just have a lot of mentally ill and depressed people for the most part. The junkies don't really come in because they don't allow drugs or anything in the shelter. But hell I went to the bathroom one time to pee and when I got back a minute and a half later my shoes were gone. I found the guy and got my shoes back but everything's up to being stolen in the shelter even your old used shoes.
10aq5oj,,j45p2ae,Haha, I had my old shoes stolen once in a men‚Äôs locker room when I stepped away to take a shower at the gym. Can‚Äôt trust no one with my shoes! üòÑ
10aq5oj,,j480l0t,You could get a lock box somewhere or a small storage locker for cheap if you‚Äôre scared it will make you a target until your circumstances change. At least for your iPad or other valuables. Obviously you have to bring in your shoes though.
10aq5oj,j47taay,,where was re you ?
10aq5oj,,j47tf7d,I‚Äôm here in Sacramento, CA
10aq5oj,j49vhnb,,I‚Äôm in Lynn Massachusetts and the shelters over here are not safe‚Ä¶.bedbugs, harassment, theft you name it all. The good ones have waitlists because they have to screen you and make sure you‚Äôre not a trouble maker
10aq5oj,,j49x3gh,Bedbugs??? Yeah, no thanks!
10aq5oj,,j49x6gu,I know...right? They spread so fast
10aq5oj,j46nexv,,Go sleep in the woods.
10aq5oj,,j47tza7,Yeah, I‚Äôll see how I can do that. I‚Äôm just grateful that my friend lets me staying at her place to get through the cold winter, but I need to get out by February, so I‚Äôm trying to figure things out what I can do VS what I can‚Äôt do. Gotta strip out of everything I own so I can start carrying things lightly fro the rest of my damned life.
10aq5oj,,j47xs3l,Are going to California?
10aq5oj,,j484jmh,No, I live here. California has been my home for over 30 years
10aoo0e,j45fdtv,,Yes it's trespassing a friend of mines who was homeless stole some snacks then they called the cops and he was arrested for trespassing
10aoo0e,j45k647,,It‚Äôs called Trespassing
10aoo0e,j45g6c2,,Yes.
10aoo0e,j4744nm,,Yes, and more than just trespassing, if you push the door open and enter it's breaking and entering. If you manipulate a door or window to enter a building, it's breaking and entering which is much more serious than trespass.
10aoo0e,j47lvdq,,That‚Äôs burglary, immediate felony
10aoo0e,,j4958fd,Yeah. You don't have to steal to make it burglary. If they think you were planning to but they caught you first then it counts.
10aoo0e,j471a2y,,I've done this before in my part of Florida just to walk around usually werehouses does this
10aoo0e,j4a6gne,,I would sooner worry about the owner than the cops.  Many businesses have someone sleeping there at night.  Sometimes it is the owner if the business is just getting by.  Sometimes it is an employee that is getting a free place to stay for  while.  You may think that there is nobody inside, but you won't know until he starts shooting.
10alocd,j453jrg,,I have a fanny pack that is virtually glued to me at all times.
10alocd,j461qab,,One solution is to get a gallon ziploc bag, put your important documents in it and then just keep that bag on you at all times - normally in a pack of some sort. If you're reasonably prudent about your personal safety (i.e. not passing out drunk in an alleyway), most people aren't going to want to start a physical altercation just to steal your pack.  Another solution is to do what a normal, housed person might do: get a safety deposit box. You can normally get one for under $100/year (which is a lot cheaper than a storage unit).
10alocd,j45jm7l,,When I was on the street I had a small 5x5 storage unit. It was about $50 a month but well worth it. Plus you can fit a surprisingly large amount of stuff in a 5x5 unit!
10alocd,j46vral,,It stays in my backpack which is either on my back or in my sight at all times.

It is so easy for people to take things like a warm bed for granted and in my experience, anytime I stopped being appreciative of the things I had, life humbled me and sometimes it humbled me in the gnarliest of ways. I am so sorry you are struggling, please feel free to DM me if you need someone to talk to and I can try to help in any way that I can. I am not stable myself but I am always happy to give what I can to help a fellow human being.   You are worthy of a happy life. You deserve stability and safety and love and kindness. Everything is temporary, things can and will change- you just gotta hang on for it.

10akxma,,j4i36q2,He has a 1 day old post history and a perfectly trimmed beard with no signs of having been outdoors. The average temperature in Poland in January is 30 degrees. Go outside sometime in 30 degree weather and look at your face an hour later. You're frostbitten. His lips aren't chapped either. There is no way this person has been outdoors in 30 degree weather for any prolonged period of time.   The picture quality on the camera is also very good, which means it's a nice camera.  He has a 1 day old post history, probably trying to grab cash for something. From the looks of his pupils, drugs.

10af0r8,,j44pj45,I grew up in Merrimack NH, right between Manchester and Nashua. Growing up homeless people fascinated me so I would often watch them and learn what they do and how they act. In my town alot of people would leave kits in hollowed logs or trees. By the river near the railroad tracks there was this huge concrete block in the ground with a cover I witnessed people climbing into in the winter. Apparently it was some kind of overflow system to keep the river from flooding. I went back with a friend one day to peek and it was crazy. At least 40 feet deep with layers of concrete slabs, each slab had a hold fire and items.

It's far from ideal going back to a toxic situation but it's better than having a breakdown and possibly getting hypothermia and becoming more sick.

10aa1en,j472apd,,Most of us don't know how to live in the winter, we tend to survive it. But if there is toxic shelter to return to, it might be just as tough to survive that! Life hands out short sticks to a certain % percentage, and you got a short one, but not the shortest! There are non-toxic shelters out there, you gotta hustle!
10aa1en,j4cmyoy,,dont give up just get help asap. go stay with your dad. it may be toxic but if hes offering you help then its not hopelessly irreparable. get healthy and then try to ease back into a regular life. if you dont feel able to work a job try volunteering somewhere a couple days a week. exercise. take walks. read. find things to fill your days and develop a schedule around them a little at a time. you have to stay occupied though or things will never improve. eventually when youre ready you can look for employment. trust me when i tell you ive been there. it just takes discipline and constant effort. no giving up. even if you have to take baby steps as small as waking up/going to bed at a certain time thats making progress. sleep deprivation from being on the streets is one of the biggest mental strains. most ppl dont realize how vital good sleep is to ones mental and phsyical health and its rare to get it whilst homeless. youve made the decision that you want to change already and thats one hurdle behind you. now just keep going.

109x564,j420ipg,,Ever since moving into my car I've become far more distrusting and suspicious of people. Most other homeless people I offer help to or they ask for help from me, have either taken advantage of me or tried to. At the laundromat, a woman asked to use my phone to make a call. After she made her call and gave it back to me, my cash app was opened and she sent herself the 13 dollars that was in it. Pissed me the hell off. If I can offer help without interacting with people I often do, but I avoid others and just worry about myself usually.
109x564,,j426gi4,Wow. Fuck that. Thank you for sharing though, as I would not have thought about that.
109x564,,j42ar6v,yep, guard your debit card too. a skewed card reader got me for $50.  I am kind, careful, distant or nomadic.   I don't stick around to meet pple.

109x564,,j456lkz,Nah. I canceled the card/number and bought another, same phone from "the wellmartz" and switched info to new one.  Ya know I had my reservations, but if we don't put any giving in the the world then the world will give us nothing.  I'm much more careful now...sometimes I don't have a phone, when asked. Also I don't put myself around junkies. This happened random in a parking area of a park. Noone else around. I got his open, which shocked us both, but ya can't fight a car.  Dude knew what he was doing. For 40 min. of phone use?
109x564,j42cr15,,What I have discovered as a case manager is that far too many of the relationships on the street tend toward becoming transactional.   What I mean by that is that, in order to survive, many people use human interaction as a means of extracting resources. This can be on the level of sharing donated food, briefly gaining someone's trust for the purpose of theft, or trafficking someone to make money in the sex trade.   Some use others as drug mules. Some will beat the living shit out of another for social dominance within the street hierarchy, which is based on the first law of the street: Most conflicts are resolved with a physical confrontation.   Every black market transactional relationship is founded on that rule. Which is why the experience of homelessness can be so traumatizing. People have to hustle to survive, and hustling almost always betrays somebody.  Authentic relationships (based on reciprocity, not transaction) are hard to come by on the street because everyone is in a situation where they must survive a hostile environment.  I always ask my clients if it is better to be alone or to be betrayed. They always say "alone".
109x564,,j42xk6l,What‚Äôs the difference between reciprocal relationships and transaction? Can you expand more on that?
109x564,,j43gue7,You ever make a cake for someone for their birthday because you love them? Fix something in their house/car for free with no expectations for compensation, because you love them? Feed them just for the sake of feeding someone you want to spend time with?  If you have, then you know the difference.
109x564,,j46zdkc,That's the wrong kind of answer to their question.  To explain... reciprocity \*IS\* transactional. It is just transactional in both directions... which is the definition of "transaction" (an exchange).  When you are getting something back for what you give, and what is given in both directions  is of equal value to those involved... that's reciprocity.  It is still a transaction.  No different from purchasing something at a store.  You get the item, you give the money.  You make the cake, and you get the love and appreciation of those who eat it.  Reciprocity is simply a fair and equal transaction.    If you make a meal, or a cake, and you share it freely with no expectation of return... that's not reciprocity... not unless you admit that you are doing the favor or making the food SPECIFICALLY because all you want in exchange is the warm feeling you get from doing something for someone else.  When only one gets what they want at the expense of another... what you are calling "transactional"... that is more like theft, or a con.  When someone steals the cake you made... or conned you into making it for them under false pretenses, maybe lying about their birthday, or lying about what they would share in exchange for you making and providing the cake.  Ever get ripped off from a store, or a "legal" transaction?  What in the UK, they would call "daylight robbery".  You know... like trying to sell a diamond or gold ring, knowing you'll never get anything close to what you paid for it?  Maybe you took something to a pawn shop for quick money, and you walked out stunned at how little your stuff was "worth"?  Or a Payday loan?  This also fits into the description of what you call "transactional"... or an exchange where one party is not happy with the result of the exchange.  So aren't we really just talking about the difference between a transactional relationship **with** reciprocity, and a transactional relationship **without** reciprocity?
109x564,,j4831u4,I don't agree that reciprocity _is_ transactional. It just doesn't really play out that way. It is much more implicit and abstract whereas transactional is understood to be explicit.  If you want to talk about legal or illegal markets, sure. General reciprocity at the 7-Eleven is easy to negotiate and discuss. Some people handle drug deals with cordiality all the time.  But good friends live by reciprocal norms that are different then what you find in any market. Those norms may draw people to want to repay someone who brings them a plate of cookies, but what it often looks like is watching someone's dog while they're out of town.   For long spaces of time it may not appear to be "equal" to an outside observer. But that relationship is a matter of trust that is worked out by individuals over years, and there are people who are never able to "repay" those "debts" they "owe" their friends.  You hear this all the time when you go to funerals. Friendships, relationships of trust, good family relationships are often unequal, and they end that way when a person dies.  Concurrently, it may appear to equal out between some people over time. But that could just be an illusion, played upon by the expectations of people that are outside of the relationship in question. Either way, I don't agree that the exchanges between friends should be understood as essentially transactional. Not by a long shot.
109x564,,j4317r1,This is too real :( you should write a book about this I want to read more
109x564,,j43f9hn,>I always ask my clients if it is better to be alone or to be betrayed. They always say "alone".  Have you asked people who are not your clients? I'm curious if there's a group of people who feel it's better to be betrayed.
109x564,,j43htfc,It's a pertinent question for those who have experienced homelessness, because they continue to allow themselves to be betrayed all the time because they are lonely AF.  The way you ask that question indicates that you think it's just common sense for everyone. Perhaps what you don't yet apprehend is that the trauma experienced by those in homelessness is exceptionally self-destructive.
109x564,,j43krwv,Sorry, I still don't understand what you're saying. I don't think it has anything to do with common sense; it's just an emotional reaction to the words. Betrayal involves more acutely negative feelings than loneliness.  If you asked, "is it better to *risk* being betrayed or to be alone," maybe you'd get a wider variety of answers that revealed more about the person. As it is, it sounds like you're laying a theory over people's lives and I'm just asking if you only do that to your clients or not.  For example, what's *your* answer to the question.
109x564,,j440rcu,No, I only ask my clients that question. Usually it's after they've moved somebody they don't really know in with them, in their subsidized housing, and have subsequently been evicted for lease violations involving physical confrontations, Non-Stop noise/fighting, hoarding of stolen items like a bicycles, the sex trade, the drug trade, Etc.  I've been case managing for 8 years. You can assume that I'm "laying a theory" on them if you want to, I don't really care. It is a question that is deeply involved with the relationship between case managers and clients who have experienced homelessness, public housing, and recidivism. I care about helping clients establish a long rental history without accruing evictions, and part of that dialogue is helping them to establish healthy boundaries with other people.
109x564,,j472v1a,Ok.  So, some of your clients get involved with predators, and then they lose their housing (or benefits) as a result.  This is more closely related to an issue with co-dependence, than one of some kind of "transactional" relationship.  Humans are social animals, and as a result, make stupid decisions in the name of maintaining some kind of social status.  They ignore red flags, or think "this person won't screw \*ME\* over, since I do \*THIS\* for them".  They repeat the same mistakes in getting involved with the same kind of people, rather than change themselves or what they do/where they go.  When I was in third grade, I believed a kid who said that if I gave him my lunch snacks, he'd give me one of his mini-bikes.  **Yes, it was stupid of me to believe that**, even if I was only in third grade.  Sure, he actually did have three of his own.  I believed him, because at the time I was the Scapegoat/Supply in my particular family situation, lorded over by a very narcissistic grandmother.  I was desperate to believe, so desperate to be part of some kind of social dynamic that wasn't toxic that I didn't see things for what they were, and I got screwed over.  If you are warning clients of the dangers of these "transactional" relationships, you are skewing their definition of the word "transaction" into a negative direction, and you are helping your client to ignore THEIR responsibilities in their side of these transactions.  Whatever happened to "Caveat Emptor" or Buyer Beware?  This applies at the store, and it applies when you are formerly homeless and in a place of your own and you are desperate for some kind of companionship/friendship/regular social interaction.  One has to pay attention to what one is getting... regardless of whether they are pulling it from a shelf, or speaking to it/going out drinking with it.
109x564,,j47rwjc,The distinction you are describing can be worked out, and my clients that are successful in maintaining their housing get there just fine.   But the trauma involved with chronic homelessness leaves the majority of my clients in a situation where the primary concern is establishing safe space, healing space, and healthy boundaries with other people.   Your description above of "some" of my clients getting involved with predators should be adjusted to _most_. So, while I agree that people are social animals, what I have observed thus far over 8 years is that the people available to my clients are usually hustling them for resources.   Becoming housed does not automatically allow people who have experienced homelessness to associate with their new neighbors. So they go back to the shelter to make friends, and those friends almost universally want to move in and utilize that housing as a base for illicit markets. Which then turns into a 3-day notice to vacate.  So that's why this distinction between transactional relationships and authentic reciprocal relationships becomes important. It is a matter of surviving housing, which requires a completely different set of tools than what is required to survive on the street.
109x564,,j45awba,I wonder who you are interviewing on some of these points.  When I was homeless and constantly bought and sold drugs every transaction was based on reciprocity and mutual benefit.  Sure people make drugs or money off the transactions but that‚Äôs preferred: avoid anyone offering to do things for free because you can‚Äôt afford it.
109x564,,j47d8vh,It's not interviews, it's case management relationships. I case manage chronically homeless individuals who are housed in scattered site subsidized housing.  I don't pretend to be their friend to get them to do what I want. I tell them that I am on the payroll, and that true friendships do not coincide with somebody getting paid.  I hear similar sentiments about illicit markets, as you describe, all the time. It reminds me a little of religious people who are cordial to each other at church functions, referring to each other as "good" people, or "the salt of the earth".  We are going to have to agree to disagree on the idea that the drug trade (both legal and illegal versions) can be characterized with the word "reciprocity". True reciprocity has nothing to do with dollars. Authentic friendships do not ask for your money, they ask for your time.  A case can be made for the term "mutual benefit", and of course there are people that handle themselves in these transactions very affably. But being nice when somebody pays you money is not remotely close to a relationship built on reciprocal trust. It is wholly dependent upon payment, as is all of the corgiality deployed therein.  Authentic relationships are rare. This is true in every socioeconomic circumstance. If you ask a billionaire how many people they trust with their heart and soul 100%, they will probably tell you the same number as a person who works at a dollar store: one or two at the most.   Some people will say zero. And the reason for that is because betrayal cuts deep.
109x564,,j4863d4,I would absolutely say people were more authentic and trustworthy (with some glaring exceptions) when I lived in homeless culture than in society at large.  The experience of poverty is that everything costs money so if you can pay you should pay.  People still help each other out all the time and do things for each other for nothing in certain situations.  If you‚Äôve never been in the homeless lifestyle I wouldn‚Äôt expect you to understand.
109x564,,j48c3tj,That's fair, and my experience is most definitely that of a social worker.
109x564,j41438h,,I do not avoid other homeless people. I'm not in a position to. People avoid and mock me for my appearance so it would be the ultimate act of hypocrisy for me to mistreat someone in similar circumstances. I am kind when possible.   I avoid people who are obviously dangerous or potentially threatening. Ex: someone obviously having a breakdown. Those who are obviously drugged out etc.  I don't interact with a lot of human beings in my daily life. As I am in my vehicle 90% of the day.
109x564,,j42avh9,this is apt. i find Im just more distant and then forget to check in at all.
109x564,,j477f6w,>As I am in my vehicle 90% of the day.  This... and this....  >I do not avoid other homeless people. I'm not in a position to.  ... conflict in a way you don't quite see.  You \*do\* avoid other homeless people, and you are in a literal position to (sitting on a seat inside a closed metal and glass box with rubber tires) avoid them.  As you are in your car 90% of the day, you aren't out interacting with other homeless people... you are instead in your car.  >I avoid people who are obviously dangerous or potentially threatening.  This makes up the leading edge of the homeless "bubble" in your area.  If you drive around, and try to spot and notice all the homeless people... and you were able to keep an accurate count... you'd find that you are seeing about 1/4th to 1/5th of the total number of homeless people in that area.  The vast majority of homeless people stay out of the public eye, or don't \*appear\* to be homeless.  It is a **minority** of the total number of homeless who are mentally ill or substance abusers, and it is a minority of the total number of homeless who are dangerous or potentially threatening.  HOWEVER... if you are **only** talking about the homeless who regularly put themselves in positions of interacting with the general homed population... that 1/4th or 1/5th you see on the streets... then, the number of predators, dangerous individuals, mentally ill and substances abusers becomes a majority.  Just to throw numbers at this.  If there's 1000 homeless in an area, you'd probably see 200 of them around town in public (or public-ish) areas.  The other 800 would have their particular way of not being seen, or not being seen as one of the homeless.  If 125 of those 200 were dangerous, or substance abusers, or mentally ill...  that would certainly give the impression that **most** of the homeless in that area were dangerous, or substance abusers, or mentally ill... even though it is an impression created by only 125 people out of 1000.  Yes, it would be hypocritical if you were to avoid homeless people, when you yourself were very aware of how people avoid you due to your homeless status.  However, you aren't letting cold homeless people into your car to warm up either.  And... are you actually avoiding being this interactive in your homeless community because you are avoiding "homeless" people?  I don't think so.  And that's why I don't believe you are being a hypocrite.  You aren't avoiding people **because** they are homeless... you are avoiding predatory and dangerous people, who also happen to be homeless.  And they just happen to be homeless... since the pool of people you have to choose from that you can be social with, is limited by your own homeless status.  If everyone around you is covered in mud, you can't blame being covered in mud for why one of them screws you over.  I'm not saying you are.  I'm just saying that it can be difficult to see the situation without the "homeless" element.

That way unless I'm working I just relax at my camp site most of my time.   If someone finds my camp I move it within the week.   Be friendly and grumpy enough to blend into most groups you pass through. Never be scared to share a meal and make a friend or to ask someone to leave you alone.
109x564,j42al4j,,sometimes, most times, pple are just talking to themselves kinda just high or drunk its not a weird thing or a voilent red flag.  trying to think up examples about pple...shelter fights are brutal but I still dont dislike others for any reason.   life is good. not easy but good.
109x564,j42cb3a,,Yes
109x564,j45370e,,It's pretty much an everyman for himself attitude outhere right now.  Which is stupid because the average person isn't street smart.  So everyone learns by losing.  It's the dumbest rule homeless people have ever bought into.  Get f*cked*d up the *$s, develop a cold heart to everyone else, then a go at it alone.  A lot of us are living a horrible life but keeping quiet about it.
109x564,j45m3ja,,Yes.  Edit: Not one time, ever, did I sleep near some one else. You inherit the problems of the people close to you. I had no problems with people.  You can't keep them away from you. No privacy when homeless. Just be polite and strong when they do bother you.
109x564,j47li6h,,I avoid others as much as possible. So unless I need to charge my devices at the bus station or warming center, I pretty much keep to myself. My camp was very well hidden untill recently when they started some construction nearby, so I'll be moving that across the river this weekend.
109x564,j44mmde,,When I was I did, at least the men, yeah. Being a homeless woman all men were potentially dangerous for me to be around. You would think they would not try to mess with me but they often did, to the point of sexual harassment.  Other women I found them sometimes very fake as friends, quick to try to use me sometimes but for the most part not too dangerous except for one or two major bullies in the shelter. I couldn't trust them with my stuff or not to try to get money off me even the little I had but they rarely threatened to rape me or beat me up.  The men some of them tried to get me addicted, tried to pimp me. Quite a few made crude comments and one tried to rape me outright once on a train. I stayed the heck away from most of them as much as possible. There were a few nice ones but far more were out to abuse women in some way and I was just not allowing that.
109x564,j446r66,,Can't stand homeless people period especially with being around 12-Step groups over 25 years as I avoid active addiction and alcoholism as that's why most people are mentally ill but sometimes realize abuse may have played a role in the addictions people have as I've always had a tough attitude towards males due to the violence towards women that's happened
109x564,j46tftc,,Why not treat them like humn beings?  Their homeless just like you.  Just open up and say hey what your saying is making me uncomfortable, no disrespect do what you gotta do I'm just communicating to you it's affecting me and I'm just trying to make it on these darn streets.  You'd be so surprised the response.  Just try it! Also they WILL tell you about resources in the city you did not know about.  There are too many to count and that is the best way to get information about it.  No joke.  Just talk to them.  They aren't bad at all and they only seem scary because you haven't tried yet.  Give it a shot
109x0im,j41rl3z,,It depends, some exhaust is part of ventilation for cooling so it's just hot air, but some is exhaust from combustion and so there is a carbon monoxide risk.
109x0im,j415grn,,Where do you find these?
109x0im,,j430ot1,Usually outside Subways lol, but I have heard at the back of 24/7 laundries too. Randomly you'll hear or feel them walking around in the early AMs too cold to sleep...
109x0im,,j44ilij,Thanks for letting me know. I will have to check Subways and laundromats.
109x0im,,j44qf9j,This is exhaust gas from a heat exchanger which is basically the carbon monoxide from combustion that the manufacturer or anyone for that matter does not want in the building. Alot goes into making sure it leaves the building to the outside. I get it. It is warm and when I am freezing my ass of in negative anything I will warm my hands on this exhaust but what ever you do don't fall asleep next to it, possibility of not waking up.

Besides, got to work on them and some maintenance requires the engine to be on.
109x0im,j454yxr,,You gotta think.  Anything that's  a big cloud of smoke exhausting to the outside of a building is most likely toxic.
109x0im,j4b2153,,Watch out for exhausts from air-conditioning systems. In certain circumstances the air could be contaminated with Legionella, leading to legionnaires disease. Apparently it can be detected by a slight sulfur or rotten egg smell.

109hw09,j3ymks1,,I did, and I am in the USA. They didn't help me with resources, in my area there were none. Meds don't help me, they didn't listen but getting some good rest and some food helped me find a reason to live again.
109hw09,j3z1zfo,,I have, the food was good but having to take medication was not good. You're stuck there too, you can't just leave when you want to. It's like prison-lite.
109hw09,j3yqb4g,,I have, and while they gave me two books of local resources, that was useless, because everything in those areas is exhausted. As far as the hospitalization itself, it was useless. I had just been made homeless after an assault. The person I was living with saw the attack happen and instead of kicking out her husband, she kicked me out. That cost me my jobs and mental health, and I‚Äôm still dealing with the effects of that. The doctors I saw there wouldn‚Äôt really go into that with me. The counselor I got afterward was also useless, and more concerned with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre codependent.‚Äù Yeah, probably, but I had much more immediate trauma I needed help with, and still haven‚Äôt found it.   The pros, aside from any actual help they might provide- if you‚Äôre currently without a place to stay, you‚Äôll have a bed and three meals a day. But they usually only keep you 72 hours unless there‚Äôs some reason to keep you there longer. Good luck.
109hw09,,j3z26fv,They kept me like 7 days. I'm sorry you went through so much. I hope it gets better
109hw09,,j3za0yj,Thank you, you too! That was my most recent experience. The worst I‚Äôve by far though, a 72 hour hold that turned into almost two weeks, a misdiagnosis, and the NP believing I was having a delusion that my father was coming to get me out from several states away. She didn‚Äôt say shit to me when he showed up ü§£   For anyone reading, if you need help, get help. Participate. Do what you can to get something out of the experience, even if it‚Äôs just a referral to regular treatment. I‚Äôve been through this a handful of times, and I have a couple regrets about not participating in certain things when they were available to me. (UCLA‚Äôs psych hospital is great. Mission County in Van Nuys should be closed permanently. Those are my highest/lowest experiences out of 4-5.)
109hw09,j3ysq5w,,Sometimes? Being in the puzzle factory ain't such a bad deal.   You're gonna get three hots and a cot.   You'll likely be assigned a social worker that will help you create a discharge plan that includes somewhere to go afterwards. This could mean a shelter system or transitional housing. Depending on what resources are really available in your area? It could even mean being placed in some form of low-income housing. There are things they can refer you to that other folks might not have access to. They've done this exact same thing before, and they're gonna have a list of things to do if their client is homeless. Being homeless and needing a place to go after admittance to a psych ward? Can sometimes move you up the line on waiting lists, too.  You're also going to create some excellent medical documentation during your visit to a psych ward, which would definitely prove useful to someone applying for  things like SSI/SSDI, as well as other resources.   The toughest parts for me? I hate group therapy with an undying passion that shall never be quenched. But that was nothing, compared to not being able to have real coffee with full-on caffeine in the morning. A few of the places I've been in also had some stupid safety feature in the showers that cuts the water off after an insanely short amount of time, which required you to hit the button again to turn it back on. That's no big deal though, cause if you fold the to-go lids on styrofoam coffee cups a couple of times, you can shove one between the button and button housing to keep it pressed in, so the water actually gets warm.   And all this is still glossing over the fact that the experience might actually prove to be incredibly good for your mental health.   If you think you need to be there? Then go, and don't worry about preparing yourself like it's being incarcerated - because it's really not. The only thing I'd do if it was affordable? Is invest in a couple of things to wear there that won't have things like laces or strings that are going to be restricted. If you've got someone or some place trustworthy to leave belongings behind? I wouldn't take anything questionable or unnecessary with me. Sometimes, you can rent a locker at a YMCA, Salvation Army, or place that runs a shelter program.
109hw09,,j3zqdrg,Hmm I‚Äôve been trying to get into some transitional or low income housing for some time, good to know going could be an advantage in that area. I didn‚Äôt realize.
109hw09,,j41njrh,Especially when resources and/or funding are tight? The almighty referral is what makes the difference between being told nothing is available, or getting bumped up a waiting list. It's unfortunate, and it shouldn't depend on "who you know" so to speak, but it simply does. A social worker who's job includes making a discharge plan for homeless clients? Usually knows who's got the money to fund things right now, and who's budgets are simply too overstretched too. They're gonna know the requirements for these programs, and the documentation you'd need.   I'm not out here telling you every social worker is good at their job, and your mileage may vary, but I've now been in every state but Hawaii, and I've gone through both assistance services for homeless folks and mental health agencies in many of them. What I've told you? Is the general way things seemed to always work. Many of my most helpful experiences were not in the more liberal and homeless-friendly states either.   A decent hospital will also help with stuff like applying for benefits. Medicaid. Food stamps. Lists of pantries and food distribution sites or mobile food pantry trucks.   What kind of housing assistance have you been trying to get, if you don't mind me asking? Given a general area, I'd be happy to help you search for assistance options if finding something has been the roadblock there. But if it's waiting lists and a hard time reach folks that supposedly can help? A stay in a psychiatric hospital as a homeless individual is gonna work in your favor, as horrible as that may sound.   I've got a friend who works for an assistance place in Michigan. They've specifically suggested to folks they go to a psych unit for the very reasons I just told you, and it's not like Michigan's mental health or assistance programs have been robustly funded to the point of it being what I'd call a good place for a homeless person.
109hw09,,j42qc6n,I‚Äôm not OP but I am presently homeless in Mi- where‚Äôs your friend located or what org do they work for? I‚Äôm running real dry on places to turn so that caught my eye.

109hw09,,j3zor37,Psych hospitals have good food plus snacks
109hw09,j3zrn2l,,I have.   First, I was in Tulsa, Oklahoma and I went to loriet.   Second, they didn't help much with resources after I got out. They did try to set me up with a therapist and a community center, but both ended up being so overwhelmed it took a while before I could get anything done.  But the in-patient care was pretty good. I was in a ward that was a step below involuntary. Food was half decent, people were reasonably respectful, and meds were consistent. I refused group therapy, but worked with my doctor's pretty well on adjusting medication and getting good feedback for improvements and diagnosis.   I will warn you that if you go there, you will likely have to be a hell of an advocate for yourself if they try to refuse a medication you normally would take. They tried to refuse breo to me because it's not on their dispensary list, but it is an absolute need for me. I finally got it on my last day.   You can't let anything slide and expect the staff to handle it. You gotta be on the ball asking for what you need and being vocal about how you feel and your symptoms.   I will say though that they were really kind about the withdrawal symptoms. They left me to sleep off the bad reaction to a local anesthetic and migraines on request, just doing check ins at first. They were also very kind about triggers. Loud noises and violent people will send me off, and they sent someone to check on me whenever my neighbor would lose it.   I'd give em a 6/10. They did try, and in some ways they succeeded, in others they dropped the ball. Overall, you could probably jump it to an 8/10 if you are coherent and an enthusiastic participant in your care plans.
109hw09,,j3zsjrg,As a follow up: if you want more time than the initial 72 hours, tell em you're actively suicidal. The key is telling em you have a plan to do it. It's one of the few ways you can keep the bed and the help on your terms, because when you think you're ready to go, you can spend about a week or two playing up your will to live. Switch to consistently telling em you have no plan, and actively enjoy thinking about the possibilities in your future. It helps to smile a bunch and pretend to get along with the other patients. They will let you back out pretty easy. If your gradual about the change, they are more likely to believe you.   I will say that going to group will help your case if you chose to go that route though. They detest it when you refuse group.
109hw09,j3zhand,,If you smoke, you won't in there. You'll get a patch and gum. You can only go outside during a certain time with a chaperone and you're locked in the ward.  You spend the day having "meetings " and coloring and eating pudding. No cell phones allowed either.
109hw09,,j42p97r,From my experience there‚Äôs so much variation. Even the folks saying the food is good- I once was in a place that even let you bring your own snacks that they held for you for meal time. That was nice if you had someone who could bring you some stuff or knew in advance. But I‚Äôve been other places were the food was even worse than typical medical hospital fare. Lots of variation on what they offer- notably the place with the snacks had us watching lifetime movies most of the time instead of actual group therapy or psycho-education type classes. It was cushier than most on amenities but utterly pointless on the mental health front.   I wouldn‚Äôt even count on getting good sleep. My last time I was stuck rooming with an elderly lady who had a freaking bed alarm on because she would get confused at night and go wandering. That freaking alarm kept me from getting much rest at all.   The things that I‚Äôd say you can count on are a bed, meds, and being fed. You will be on a locked ward and won‚Äôt be allowed a lot of things- from the obvious like razors and such to the somewhat less obvious- they usually won‚Äôt allow shoelaces or strings in hoodies or even caps on pens sometimes. So there is a serious lack of freedom. Which might be comforting or might be absolutely terrifying depending on the mental state you‚Äôre in.    I‚Äôd also say it can be quite rough because while most people will probably be more or less like you- folks going through tough shit. Depending on the place, you can have some scary encounters with really sick and frightening people. And it can just be a heavy thing being locked up and listening to everyone‚Äôs stories.   But there is so much variation from one hospital to the next. In any given area I‚Äôve ever lived you‚Äôll usually hear that some places have a much better reputation than others. But even if you know that in advance you probably don‚Äôt have a choice because it tends be more about who has an open bed at the time.   I‚Äôm not trying to scare you by any means and absolutely, if you feel it‚Äôs something you need or might benefit from- go! And as a few others have said- to some degree it is what you make it so try and participate and take advantage of everything you can. It‚Äôs definitely a place to lay it all out if you get the chance- like don‚Äôt hold back and hide parts of what you‚Äôre experiencing out of shame or fear.   I‚Äôve never been in the position of homelessness while hospitalized in a psych ward though I‚Äôm in the position I‚Äôm in now as a homeless person after multiple medical hospitals pretty much blew me off. And oof, unfortunately I‚Äôd say the biggest amount of variation can be in the quality of social workers and discharge planning that places do. They aren‚Äôt supposed to just dump you on the street but some can and will. Hopefully not. And I mean, you might as well try, right?  I think there‚Äôs always more need than available help so I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll bring you any real advantages in that way. So don‚Äôt go just hoping for resources, but because it‚Äôs what your mental health requires. Hopefully you have a good experience and meet some good folks who are able to help connect you to more assistance.

109hw09,,j3zpw5v,I have a couple reasons but the short story is after fighting for years to get out of an abusive situation, I ended up succeeding only to be indefinitely homeless. Bit of a soul crusher. I also have a mental health condition no one in my area I‚Äôve seen knows how to treat or is willing to treat.
109hw09,,j42rrye,I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre experiencing this. I‚Äôm in a somewhat similar situation leaving an abusive relationship and just collecting an endless pile of shit ever since. There‚Äôs too many of us with stories like this. And if your abusive situation isn‚Äôt clear cut (like a spouse or partner versus other people in your life- think I saw from one of your comments that your situation was more complex. Mine too) or you‚Äôre already out of it you tend not qualify for any of domestic violence shelters or assistance.   Soul crushing is the perfect word for it and I get even more upset hearing other peoples stories and knowing I‚Äôm not unique in this.   I‚Äôm not the best at chatting up strangers but legit if you need to vent or want to chat hit me up. And either way- I hope you keep fighting and have some better luck soon. I know I am often flip-flopping between thinking ‚ÄúDamn it, I fought hard and this long so I‚Äôm not giving up now‚Äù and just drowning in my despair and hopelessness. Especially as time keeps passing and I‚Äôm still stuck.

109e595,j4takls,,are you ok? is there anywhere you can stay to evade or avoid being homeless. the first month is tough OKC is mild but winter is still winter. i hope u are well
108vr15,j3usijo,,You want to charge 650 for 1/4 of a room with no say as to who you'd be sharing a room with?  For a 4 bedroom you're trying to get 10k a month for warehousing people?  How is the bathroom situation? 4-8 or more sharing a bathroom is a bit crazy.  Will a traditional water heater handle this many people?  Sharing a kitchen with a dozen or more people may not be viable.  There are probably zoning issues as well.   What are you going to do if someone doesn't pay you?  Are you going to file eviction papers?  Do you think USPS will want to deliver mail to 12+ individuals at one address?    Not trying to be negative, but it sounds like there are a lot of issues with an individual trying to operate this.
108vr15,,j3uvbz2,Thanks for your feedback. I just thought that some people would like a bed to sleep on and a place to shower for an average cost of $22 per night. And this is transitional, once they have saved enough, they can get their own apartment and transportation. There are many people in the area sleeping out in tents so I thought this would be a better option for those who are trying to get back on their feet.     I might have to change it to 2 per room and charge more.
108vr15,,j3ux1kf,People can't afford to pay that much and save at the same time.
108vr15,,j3uy6kj,Minimum wage here is $15 an hour, which comes to $2400 per month (gross). Most jobs are paying $17ph. So $650 for accommodation, utilities, and transportation is a huge bargain. They can save up for a few months, get their own car and eventually their own place. That's the goal I'm aiming for and I'm trying to see if there are enough people interested in something like that.
108vr15,,j496zdj,But they can rent their own room for that price...
108vr15,j3ur1ng,,Talk with a SCORE mentor - small business administration. That's a lot of licensing
108vr15,,j3urrg0,Definitely. I'm also thinking that in California, $650 a month might barely cover the mortgage and taxes, much less utilities, transportation and groceries for several people.
108vr15,,j3utnvr,I would not provide groceries, just transportation for people to go grocery shopping. I'm also not looking to make a huge profit off of this. Just to cover all the expenses, and pay the driver and vehicle maintenance.
108vr15,,j3ythm4,Why wouldn't 4\*650 suffice for mortgage? Taxes will be a give and take, I wouldn't assume the worst, especially if it becomes some kind of non-profit
108vr15,,j4945pp,That ($2,600) probably would cover the mortgage. But you're required to have homeowners insurance, and there are property taxes and taxes for the medical and/or school districts, depending on where the house is. Plus you have utilities -- water, electricity and trash at a minimum. If he's going to provide transportation, even if he already owns the vehicle, there's going to be insurance on that. And gas would probably take a good chunk every month, considering that 6 people will be using it daily to go to work, to the doctor, shopping, etc. (Isn't gas around $5 a gallon there now?)   Becoming a nonprofit might lower some of those expenses, but being certified as a 501(c)3 costs several thousand dollars upfront. You'll need a different kind of insurance, a lot of certifications, a certified commercial driver to haul people around ...  It's a great idea, but it just may not be financially feasible.
108vr15,,j3us5qo,Thank you for your feedback. I'll definitely talk with one of their mentors.
108vr15,j3urmxl,,People on disability need this and the elderly too. Except rides would be to dr.‚Äôs not jobs. You can do 2 per room Only or the gov will shut you down.
108vr15,,j3usd4v,Thanks for replying. I thought that providing transportation would be great for maybe even people who are recovering from addiction or something like that, and would make life a little bit easier.     I also didn't know that the max is 2 per room. So thanks for the heads up.
108vr15,,j3wieop,Yeah can‚Äôt get rich off the homeless. Recovery homes, group homes of any kind all have restrictions. Most homeless people can‚Äôt afford $650 a month unless they are on disability, but many places a room cost $650 a month with no room mate. Look into local group homes for more info. People do this and your not alone In the idea.    Group homes can make money to live on for the ones working just not much. Social work unless you have a masters degree is not very lucrative.
108vr15,j3uudue,,This is an awful idea. Do you really not know anything about the reality of dealing with junkies?  They will rob you and everyone else then burn the place down.
108vr15,,j3ux3i6,That's what I was thinking too.
108vr15,,j3uxdvh,There would be a screening process for residents. I'm trying to help those who are down and really need a small break (a place to sleep, shower, and an address) to get back up. Otherwise, did you mean to say that all homeless people are junkies?
108vr15,,j3uy19a,What would the screening process be?
108vr15,,j3v0m8k,A questionnaire about their previous history and a background check. Also maybe a drug test. What else would you recommend?
108vr15,,j3v26h9,A background check and drug test will cost money, will you be covering the cost?  Honestly, I'd suggest not doing this in general. It sounds like you are trying to open your own homeless shelter with no government backing and trusting people will pay you.. How would you enforce the rent? What about damages or disagreements?   I get the sentiment but there are reasons people don't regularly do this.
108vr15,,j3v3fhp,Thank you for that. I'm now thinking that I will probably go a different direction with this business idea and opportunity. Thank you and all the best.

108vr15,,j3xoeb7,There's your problem. You see helping people as a "business opportunity."
108vr15,,j3xycqx,You have to approach it as a business or else it will not last long.  How else will the mortgage and bills be paid?
108vr15,,j496kts,By only taking enough to cover the places rent and not trying to make a profit?  Plus who would pay $700 to share a room with 3 other people? You can rent your own room for that.

108vr15,j3wprwk,,650.00 per bed four people to room is 2600.00   four rooms is 10400 a month unless you are going to immigrant style house and have 10/15 beds   So you would gain around 124800.00 per year off homeless ... okay     Just open a Air B&B then.  If you were legit about helping 3 Bedroom house one occupant per room for 500.00 would be helping. Is this short term? And you would be in charge of the house? Cause if its junkies the place is going to get robbed and stripped I would put the BASIC  in there  bed, dresser, desk   table chairs sofa fridge washer and dryer.  Have you gone through the License process? If you were really wanting to help, find a small house and rent it cheaper to a family that the market.   Not trying to be a down about your plan, but it needs more thinking.
108vr15,,j3xx8uo,There is no way someone can get a 3 bedroom in most California cities  and rent out rooms for $500 each and be able to pay the mortgage, utilities, and taxes...leave alone transportation. For those kind of rates you will have to go to some remote or rural locations where there are no jobs around.   As for airbnb, the cheapest around was $31 per bed per night, with no transportation. My rate came out to $22 per night and I would transport residents to/from work daily.  Otherwise, thank you for your tips. It might seem like I was going to make a lot of money with this idea, but that is not true at all. Also, after reading all the feedback I have decided to pursue another idea. All the best.
108vr15,,j3z0rf0,  You said you wanted to help people, usually that means YOU would take the impact of loss and cover it. What you could do is apply for grants if you are able to open a transitional house. There are plenty of programs that help cover the expense of operating and facility and cover additional expenses.
108vr15,,j3z0w0p,Also a used van would be fine for transportation.
108vr15,j3x92ny,,Its a good idea but its also a lot of work with many moving parts. Before you make a move consider finding someone already offering this or a similar service and offer them a partnership or investment opportunity.
108vr15,,j3xxn3b,I had talked to someone who was doing something similar with a sober living home, but he was not including transportation of residents. Otherwise, thank you for your response. It seems like not many people like this kind of arrangement so I am pursuing a different idea.

108uybt,j3up6on,,I have a fairly vibrant homeless population that live in the green areas and no tell motels. About 40% are elderly + 60 < 80 30% are middle aged in wheel chairs and various disablities and the remainder is flux drug related and or mentally ill. One elderly woman parks her walker at the highway exit begging for money. Some have disability checks and state medicaid and those typically stay in the hotels a few nights a week having to find shelter whereever they can. There are no social services available to them in my area. All of the homeless were run out of downtown so it could be developed/rehab but all of the shelters and churches that do help are downtown.
108uybt,,j3ur5rh,Thank you for sharing!. Do you mind if ask what city or even state your talking about (if your ok with it)?. Yeah, those cheap 100.00 per week motels can be great when you need a home-base to get back on your feet or just need to chill for awhile.  I guess you just get out there and see what developes. Maybe you run into someone and they help you or you just get some type of routine/hustle going and things just kind of fall into place.

108uybt,,j3wl0dh,736 homeless died in Phoenix Arizona in 2022. That number doesn‚Äôt include the 450 that were not categorized correctly. I was homeless in June and July here and had to stay at a shelter. There are so many programs for the homeless here but you have to follow rules or you get kicked out. It‚Äôs impossible for addicts to follow the rules so live in The Zone in tents and die from overdoses of fentanyl, dehydration etc. It was horrible and scary in the shelter. I was sexually assaulted in my sleep by another woman. That wasn‚Äôt bad enough for her to get kicked out though. Our state makes billions of tax dollars off marijuana sales and I would like to see some of it help the addicts get into a safe place. Fentanyl abuse is so rampant here they even smoke it on train and bus. Most bud stops are just drug dens. It‚Äôs impossible to avoid in the areas of town with shelters.

108qwvr,j3u752e,,As with any program that targets disabled, it will depend upon personal finances, resources, and what the state/federal guidelines are. Simply being disabled doesn't mean you automatically get anything. The major difference between disabled and able bodied, for me, was that my state gives me a longer period of receiving food stamps without needing to reapply as often. I still have to report any income changes, including rent changes. I still have to re-apply by my renewal date. I still can be denied for food stamps. I just don't have to re-apply every three months, just once a year.  Other programs, unless specifically for disabled or elderly, are going to be just as likely to have program restrictions that may be only slightly looser than for able bodied. In fact, some can be MORE restrictive for disabled/elderly, because you may gain in one area, but then lose in another. I gained 8.7% for a cost of living increase. That put me too high to continue to get free health care. Now, I'll likely easily eat away the extra money by needing to pay co-pays and deductibles. I would have preferred to not have that extra 8.7%, because my medical issues can cost me more in the long term.
108qwvr,j3u71p2,,That is dependent upon the state in which you reside.

108p2lq,,j3u09et,https://www.shelterlistings.org/city/somerset-ky.html  This is list of available housing options near Somerset. I clicked on Hope Center, looks like the price is 200-400 per month. Their phone number is 606 348 4650. Try to give them a call. There are also other options in the link.
108p2lq,,j3tzd6l,http://www.lc-caa.org/index.php/17-articles/35-article-22   This non-governmental organization called emergency food and shelter program offers food and temporary housing solutions. It is currently marked as available. The temporary housing is in a place called Liberty, which is 27 miles away from Somerset.
108p2lq,,j3ubg0f,This looks like a good organization to visit. Even if they do not have the availability stated on the website, you will still want to talk with them about the program to find out what it takes to qualify.  If they have any case managers, take a business card. Stay in contact with them.  It may turn out that your grandma is the only one that qualifies for housing, but that is still a win. Even if you are only staying in contact with them for her sake, it is better for one of you to get housing then none of you.  Then, if you both eventually get housing in separate apartments, you have access to twice the resources.  In addition to learning more about this program, you're going to want to ask about other programs in the area that you may qualify for.

108p2lq,,j3xg04o,This. This. This. I‚Äôm a younger disabled person (and homeless with a cat myself) and I‚Äôm often a mix of jealous and annoyed at the wealth of resources for elderly folks vs younger disabled people.   I‚Äôd also add religious orgs- Lutheran Services or Catholic Charities and I‚Äôm Jewish (though understand there‚Äôs not a ton of Jews in Kentucky) and know that Jewish Family Services and such have a lot of elderly resources and none of these places require you to be an active member of their religion.   But I actually think the grandmother may end up being an advantage for OP on the social service front. I get why some are telling her what they are when her hoarding issues caused their homelessness but it‚Äôs going to be WAY harder for an 18 year old to get services alone- though she might be young enough to qualify for youth shelters and programming which I can say from personal experience are generally fantastic- like as good as it‚Äôs going to get for a shelter. But again, the cat would be an issue there. I do wonder if a youth shelter might still be a decent place to go for support or assistance though as well.
108p2lq,,j3xpks9,Just wanted to say I'm right there with you. I've noticed too that there isn't that much support for younger people with disabilities, especially in housing. We have supposedly moved away from institutionalization and towards independent living in the community, but there are just not enough housing options. I have a severe disability myself and I'm very fortunate I can still live with my parents, but without them I'd be in trouble. In my state I'm trying to advance accessible housing and develop more places folks like you and I can live.
108p2lq,,j3yj1xy,It‚Äôs awesome you‚Äôre working on what you are. My parents are much older than the norm (they were 46 and 51 when they had me!) so at this point they‚Äôre basically in their 80s and not doing well but even before that point weren‚Äôt supportive.   Really interesting point about the institutionalization thing. Because in many ways the reason I‚Äôm homeless was my refusal to go to a nursing home. My favorite part was a doctor who insisted I could not possibly continue to receive the life sustaining treatments while homeless. So she painted nursing home as the only option. Well, she was wrong. I‚Äôm getting that treatment. But it also means I can‚Äôt stay in a regular shelter. It‚Äôs absolute rock and a hard place.   I also hopped states in this mess and am the top of the list suddenly for a supportive housing unit for disabled and homeless folks in the state im not currently in and they‚Äôre pushing me to get over there and sign paperwork and I‚Äôm not even sure I can and it‚Äôs all just ugggggggh. And I have long lived with that terror that if you don‚Äôt have family to care for you, there really isn‚Äôt anything else. So part of me realizes even if I finally find my way out of the mess I‚Äôm in now that fear will never leave. I‚Äôll always be half a step away from exactly what‚Äôs happened now.   Anyway. Totally rambling. It‚Äôs been so freaking hard though because it‚Äôs like what little disability assistance does exist or the options for homeless folks in general don‚Äôt really work for my needs. So I‚Äôm treading and spinning circles getting nowhere. It‚Äôs really gross that societally we‚Äôre happy to throw the most vulnerable amongst us to the wolves basically.
108p2lq,,j4f49ik,Appreciate it. It's definitely a struggle. The biggest thing that the accessible housing development comes down to is cost, and that's hard to get around without more federal funding. That and time. It took us decades to get into this housing crisis (even before we were building with disabled folks in mind) and it will take us decades to get out of it most likely. I'm sorry to hear about your parents. Between them not doing well and not being supportive is tough. I'm very glad and fortunate my parents have been nothing but supportive.  Yes, exactly! No young person with a disability wants to have to live in a nursing home. Not being ageist, but being segregated from peers your age is devastating. It's one thing if it's multigenerational (which I think it should be, because siloing away our elders is also bullshit), but if you're literally the only person below retirement age (or younger) that must be so isolating.  How come you can't stay in a shelter while doing this treatment? Or is it just not accessible enough?  I like the concept of universal design - that is, making spaces usable to greatest extent possible by the most number of people as possible. I think we should apply this philosophy to all buildings so that we don't have to retroactively make shit accessible. Just do it from the beginning. It may be more expensive upfront, but in the long run it will save time, money, and resources. To your point about being thrown to the wolves, we don't do this because as a market society we're too focused on short term profits and gains. We used to make buildings that were built to last and carefully crafted to fit their community. Form followed function. Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED Talk lol.  Ah I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through right now. I hope you can figure out something soon. I wish I could help somehow.

108p2lq,j3uaoig,,If you have a therapist, talk to them about getting Prissy documented as your ESA (Emotional Support Animal). ESA's can be any type of cat, unlike the dogs and mini horses that are considered true support animals. ESA's have the same housing rights, although hotels and motels are not required to allow them to stay. But you can't be denied housing due to an ESA, and ESA's can't be charged as pets (no pet deposits, no pet rent, but you can be held responsible for any damage, if caused by the ESA). They are considered medical equipment, but don't have public access (can be denied entry into public buildings like theatres, restaurants, stores, etc).  If you can get her documented, then it makes it much easier to get her into an apartment. There are four exceptions to ESA housing, but it's the same as for those with service animals as well. Your primary care doctor may agree to document her, but therapists are preferred, since they are EMOTIONAL support, rather than physical support. Just talk to the therapist, and explain how much better your quality of life is since you got her. My therapist saw that, even without me directly talking about it, and offered to document my cat before I could ask. The paperwork should just need to be on the doctors letterhead, with the confirmation that you have a cat ESA, and have the doctors contact information provided. It should be dated, and my apartments have accepted it as long as it was less than a year old. They shouldn't need a new document for the time you stay at the apartment/house.

I replied to someone else who recommended the Area Agency on Aging and in my experience as a younger physically disabled person (sometimes the Area Agency on Aging provides assistance to disabled folks of all ages but the greatest amount of options and resources tend to be for older folks) it may actually be to your advantage to stay with your grandma because she‚Äôs likely to qualify for more help and to get it faster than you would alone. So I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs probably an advantage to you. The cat‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a lot more difficult but I totally understand since I‚Äôm in the same exact boat and absolutely refuse to put my cat through the trauma of separation.   And if you guys haven‚Äôt already definitely contact your local Department of Human Services office for Medicaid and food stamps and any other assistance that may be available to you. Sometimes- though it really depends on the worker- DHS also has lists of other local resources. But they should basically be your first stop because a lot of charities ultimately turn people towards DHS anyway.   Good luck. And honestly keep your grandma and that cat close because I‚Äôve found one of the worst about homelessness is just the loneliness of it all. In that sense it‚Äôs a blessing to have a loved one with you versus going it alone. I really hope things improve for you all soon.

108p2lq,j3x7pwz,,If your grandma has a hoarding problem, then see if you can get a storage unit for her belongs and talk with your current landlord and make a deal that you will work on it. Sometimes, explaining your situation and working with people changes everything. Maybe if the landlord sees you are going to help your grandma and clean the house she will allow you both to stay.  Look up prices at Public Storage, and see if you can put your grandma‚Äôs things in there.  If you donate plasma you can make enough money to cover the storage unit for your grandmothers belongings.  Your grandma has a mental illness that is making her hoard. I think you should talk with her and explain she can keep the stuff, but it has to be in the storage unit and the house has to be clean, because you don‚Äôt want to get kicked out.  Eventually your grandma might need to see a therapist or doctor who helps people with hoarding mental disorders.  I wish you three luck!

108htg5,j3tlpid,,1. Don't rely on people unless they are absolutely trustworthy. I.E, you have known them for years and they have proven themselves.  2. Steer clear of 99% of the people that you come in contact with the are also experiencing homelessness. A good rule of thumb to remember is that the more you trust people that you don't know, the more you will be exploited, taken advantage of, trafficked, and robbed.  3. Access services that you qualify for (case management, food banks, women's shelters, church charity) so that you can get food and hygiene items.  4. If your boyfriend is a trustworthy person, and does not harm or abuse you, then work to stay his friend even if you guys break up. Homelessness can be rough on relationships, but having at least one person that can help you is a valuable lifeline. Don't lose that lifeline even if you guys decide that you're not going to stay together.  5. Try to find a women's shelter and tell them that you want a housing case manager. Even if you do not want to stay in the shelter, it is important to establish a relationship with a case manager who can hook you up with subsidized housing opportunities.   6. See if your town has a YWCA. They often have services for women in your situation.  7. Find the cheapest gym membership that you can find, and try to get a month to month contract with them so that you can access their bathroom and shower facilities whenever you need to.
108htg5,,j3tmd6h,Also:  Do not expose yourself to your brother's bullying ever again. Both he and your father have proven themselves to be unworthy of you. Ignore anyone who tells you to just put up with it. You are correct to refuse abusive behavior and enabling behavior.  It's not about "teaching them a lesson". It's about the fact that you have learned your lesson.  Ask every organization that you talk to about the possibility of parking your car.
108htg5,j3tz81b,,I don't have many tips but I'm so sorry to hear this, I hope u manage to figure it out. Your brother and dad are both bullies.
108htg5,j3tecrm,,dam
108htg5,j3u3cmv,,Remember that homelessness doesn't change who you are as a person. Focus on creating a clean and solid plan, with goals that you can achieve and people who are interested in your growth. There are many people both good and bad who use people that are struggling for clout or to take advantage. I say this from my own experience with homelessness. You can take steps to make a life that suits you, just take it one day at a time and focus on not making rash or impulsive decisions because you feel pressured to. You've got this!
108htg5,j3u6l84,,I'm sorry you are going through this.  Your dad should be throwing your brother out.  Does he know you are leaving?
108htg5,,j3uhyj5,Yes I told him.   All my brother does all day every day is play video games until he hears me wondering around then comes out of his room to start a "friendly conversation" only to go off on me as soon as I disagree with his point of view.  My dad says there's nothing he can do because my brother is an adult. I gave him many options like take his fucking computer away. He once again said he can't do that because my brother is an adult.   Um, yeah you can. If your son living with you is relentlessly bullying your daughter to the point of a mental breakdown you can easily walk into his room and take away his computer if that's the only thing that will make him stop. The fact that he's an adult doesn't change that because he's clearly a child in a grown man's body.  I told him I'm leaving because I'm envious of the fact that my brother can do whatever he wants and I just have to take it because he's disabled.
108htg5,j3vcgv3,,Your dad sounds as stupid as mine. I'm sorry, but I needed to say that, since I'm about to live in my car as well because of my dad's BS. As a result, I don't have much in the way of practical advice, but... yeah, dads like ours piss me off.
108htg5,j3vzsck,,Try to look for other options if you have them even if it's not a perfect situation, I lived in a household with an older brother that was the worst bully you could imagine. I did martial arts my whole childhood including Jiu-Jitsu while my two older brothers became Golden Glove boxers.  Anytime I would say something back my father would tell me to be quiet and show respect to my older brothers then when they started bullying especially the one about, he would always tell me to handle it myself.  One day after being slapped in the face probably as hard as he could slap I choked him just barely into unconsciousness with absolutely zero effort, the other brother jumped up but decided he didn't want to get choked then my dad told me to leave the house.  I stayed in my vehicle for approximately a week until a family member offered me a room if I could help with rent.   Although I would rather have that car situation versus staying with them any longer it was absolutely terrible, was not comfortable one minute the entire week, try to see if there are any family or friends that would rent you a room
108htg5,j3wx6sy,,Public beaches have public showers and bathrooms.  You will also be able to use restrooms at gas stations and public rest areas.  The airport is another good place to go. Even before TSA, there are outlets and bathrooms and vending machines.  Remember to get a sleeping bag or good blankets if you are sleeping in your car.  Lastly. Factories are always hiring. The military is always hiring. Indeed.com is better than 90% of job boards out there. Stay away from people unless you're really sure of your people judging skills.  Best of luck.
108htg5,j3syej2,,What state are you in? Maybe I can point you to a few resources that may help you.
108htg5,,j3u5wlj,Tennessee, which also has the most strict idle car law at 3 hours :/
108htg5,,j3uh556,Oof. You‚Äôll have to be careful around rest areas, and the like‚Ä¶not only sleeping, but even looking like you might be living/camping/cooking could get you arrested.  Good news is‚Ä¶you‚Äôve got some options, seek out resources wisely.  If you do run into trouble, hopefully you‚Äôre in a blue city and they seem to be trying to avoid the ‚Äúfelony‚Äù charges by handing out misdemeanors instead (I believe the city mayors have this amount of authority).  It‚Äôs odd, I don‚Äôt really understand it, but its just as they say‚Ä¶politics‚Ä¶I was actually reading about where a certain blue city mayor in TN was having a discussion with the Chief of Police about the issue and he told the mayor this‚Ä¶if they get calls to come out and see about someone camping illegally‚Ä¶they have to carry out the law and make the arrest.   Wild stuff eh?.
108htg5,j3ux95l,,I'm sorry that your brother and dad are treating you unfairly. I used to be a case manager, and I can try to help you look up resources. I have a few questions:  1) Do you mind sharing your age? There might be shelters in your area for homeless youth. Where I live, these shelters accept people between the ages of 18-25.    2) Are you attending some school or educational program? This could be K-12, community college, university, or technical programs. Your school might offer special services or grants to support you.     3) Do you have any friends that you can stay with for the time being? Even if they don't have room right now, maybe they could offer you a safe place to park overnight? I'm glad that your boyfriend is offering to let you shower, laundry, etc. at his place, even if you can't live with him for now.     4) Do you have any nearby relatives that can help you? I saved this for last because it could be tricky depending on their relationships with your dad and/or brother.  It might be helpful to ask if you can stay with a friend or a relative for a specific amount of time (like 2 weeks, 2 months, etc) until you can find a job and a place to live.  5) There might be a resource hotline in your county or state that provides referrals to community programs, like shelters for homeless people, domestic violence survivors, LGBT, etc. Even if these shelters don't have space right now, they might be able to offer cash assistance or motel vouchers so you can stay in a motel for a couple nights for free.   I'm sorry again for what you're going through. You deserve to be treated with respect by your brother. Regardless of you and your brother's age, your father is still your parent and should act like one in difficult situations like this. I'm taking a guess that your dad is passive or tends to bend to your brother's will, which is unacceptable. Especially when it gets to this point where you're leaving your house... He defend your brother, but you are also his child and worthy of respect and healthy boundaries.   To end on a positive note, I am happy to hear that your boyfriend is trying his best to be supportive. His parents might not let you live with them now, but they might change their mind in the future. I'm glad that you are trying to better your life and leave your toxic home environment. Not everyone has the courage and support to leave a negative situation. Best of luck, and my DMs are open.  *Quick update*: Sorry, I misread your post and thought you had a car. I think it might be more urgent to call the resource line or domestic violence shelters near you. I'm guessing from your avatar that you may be a woman (my apologies if I'm incorrect). Many DV shelters accept women, and some accept people of all genders (but unfortunately, it's not as common). I recommend DV shelters because you might be moved to a small house or apartment complex, instead of a general homeless shelter than could be more dangerous and filled with more people. I think this is an emergency, so I really hope the shelter hotline can find a bed for you tonight - honestly, I think they might give you a motel voucher because most shelters are impacted (at full capacity).
108gme2,j3twgpm,,What does busking mean?

108gme2,j49827v,,  You can try talking to them and pointing out you were there first.  If that fails and you can make yourself look non-homeless you can fuck them with a complaint about the scary homeless person to the buisiness they are nearest. But it may mean you can not busk there in the future.   It's a shitty situation.
108glku,j3s4umq,,Depends on your income and which state
108glku,j3sje2v,,Depends upon what your income is, what state, and where you are currently living. In your own room or apt buying your own food or living in your folks home or say in a shelter? It all affects what you might get. Also age can be a factor because younger people they think might be able to work p/t at least they can be tougher on work requirements. Your state usually has an estimator online that will give you an idea.

108a0o4,,j3rtgod,Nope. Been there, done that and I lost it all to a bad tropical storm. Years of work just gone. I don't want a house anymore. I'm very happy with my little studio in the big city. I'd like to have a better apt someday maybe but putting all that work into owning a home that just requires more work and more money just isn't something I am up to anymore.   I had the house, the car, the decent bank account only to lose it all over a couple of very bad years. It made me rethink what I thought I wanted a lot. I've learned to live with a lot less. I've pretty much been forced to downsize my ideas of success by chronic illness. I still have ambitions but they don't include home ownership again. Not unless I get very rich and can afford anything anyway and even then I'd sooner buy a loft here in NYC than a house elsewhere.   I put so much work and money into my house only to lose 95% if it alas...
108a0o4,,j3rxx17,Part of the reason I don't want to live on the east coast. It's also part of the reason I tell people to stop risking things and move away from hurricane land.
108a0o4,,j3s0z6g,Any coast has major storms and even the middle of the country isn't immune. My Mom's family my great grandfather built a big farmhouse in Kansas City and it stood for nearly a hundred years but one bad tornado and it was history.   The tornado literally flattened the house and everything in it was gone. The only reason my Grandmother on that side survived was because she went into the cellar.   Everything was smashed except oddly this porcelain egg that was kind of a family heirloom. I still have that now even though a tree fell on my house and destroyed it. It's remarkable that it's made it through two natural disasters that egg.   Mama Nature can get you wherever you live. If it's not storms then it's earthquakes or floods or fires or volcanos. Nobody is ever completely  safe from a potential natural disaster really.   One guy I knew he bought a house with his wife and it turned out the house was built on a huge snake nest. All Winter they were fine, just digging their new house but come Spring they had freaking snakes everywhere, including a bunch of cooperheads.   They had to move out and they sued the former owner for non disclosure. 250K house and they couldn't live in it without it crawling with snakes when it was warm.   Stuff happens. It's just life. Look at what's happening out in California right now. Even rich people like Oprah are having to vacate their homes because of major flooding. A few months ago it was forest fires. Mama Nature doesn't much care if you're affluent or not. :P
108a0o4,j3rbqap,,Thank you for this, I shared it to the community r/HomelessHomebound which is specifically for homeless persons seeking a way out of this situation.
108a0o4,j3rbd87,,Your advice is great, for that small percentage of homeless people that are not disabled, chronically ill, already employed, parents, elderly, or otherwise unable to bounce around for years or join the military or similar organization.
108a0o4,,j3rw55g,It's definitely niche. Tons of folks wouldn't be able to do this, but I'm certain there are quiet a few who could and just may not realize they can. Heck, if I'd have known when I was homeless that I could pull this off I doubt I'd have even joined the military.
108a0o4,j3rjoa7,,how do you go about getting a job when moving to a different place, on the note of your address? wouldnt they want an address thats in their state instead of your old one?

108a0o4,,j3sx276,for low end places that does seem valid, but to get into a job that could afford you housing what would you do?
108a0o4,,j3ttlmg,The point of this thread is that if you can find an affordable house in a high minimum wage state, you can afford housing even at minimum wage.   TL;DR is minimum wage in NY is $14.20, netting you $400/wk for FT work, and homes are available in that state with a mortgage of about $400/mo.
108a0o4,,j3tuwy5,thank you
108a0o4,,j3uuopm,   Places rarely send anything its all digital esp places in fast food, when applying look around and get the address of a place near by (not a historical mansion lol) and use its as "Great Aunt Gerddy" you move here to take care of.... if they check your ID. One good thing about minimum wage jobs is  you just got to have a pulse and upside usually you can get a lot of hours to help get you least gas and food.
108a0o4,j3srwmj,, Thank you.   When I got to NO and had just enough to purchase fifteen years ago, I tell people if you saw what my abode looked like! The part about getting a loan is true my house was ex-crack & squatters, no side porch in the inside was a memory that once was. Even the roaches and rats laughed as they waltzed by. People can get tunnel vision on how a house looks vs could also maybe its me being stubborn or nutz --- somethings you think you could not possibly live in or with YA CAN. I had mildew, mold, leaks, rotten wood no proper bathroom (you do not wanna know) my brother installed a sink and toilet he told me to leave and burn it!    Took couple years to really become my piece of the pie. Lived in car, scrapped worked full time and odd jobs (cash in hand is helpful)   Overall OP you are correct getting a home is a uphill climb HUD is a good route, but its worth it and keep in mind you can always rent out a room or house should you need to.

108a0o4,j3sv0g4,,When you‚Äôre in the coast guard, are you working a full 40 hours per week? Or what is the schedule like? Also, do you need to live near the ocean to qualify?
108a0o4,,j3ttfcx,The US Coast Guard is a branch of the military: you forfeit all the luxuries of a normal job as part of your contract. You have no say over how many hours you work. You could be stationed anywhere in the world (though 98% of the time you'll be in the USA, this is unique to the Coast Guard). You could be on a gigantic ship or you could be in an office. You could be at a low operational tempo station that is frozen half the year in Wisconsin, or you could be nightly chasing narcoterrorists in Miami or fighting terrorizing surf to save lives in Oregon.   If you're on a *big* ship, you will not work 40 hours a week, you will work 116. You will not sleep much and will be under constant stress. You will be expected to get qualified in firefighting and shipboard damage control as well as basic marine oiler duties in the engineroom OR steering the ship and being a lookout. Smaller ships can be easier - some are downright awesome (like the river tenders on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers). Missions on the ships range from counterdrug operations on the high seas or the Gulf to icebreaking in the arctic or the great lakes to search and rescue on bays and open ocean to setting buoys on inland waterways on big barges.  Or you could be sent to a Station, where we have small boats (usually 29 to 47 feet in length) that are dispatched for Search and Rescue and law enforcement. There, you'll be on a 2-on 2-off schedule: 2 days on, 2 days off, no matter what. Like a firefighter. You stay overnight and are on-call while on duty. Duty could be easy and simple 90% of the time, or it could be insanely busy all year long. Depends wildly on the location.   You start with no specialty as a general seaman or marine oiler. After a few months, you can elect to be sent to a school where you receive training in a specialty (which is worth college credit) and then you'll be sent to a new unit. Specialties range widely: Radio operator, boat driver, mechanic, cook, electronics tech, IT, HR, intelligence specialist (top secret), gunner's mate, damage controlman.   After 4 years of service with an Honorable Discharge, you qualify for veteran's health benefits for life. You qualify for a completely free 36 months of study (winds up being a Bachelor's usually) during which you get a monthly housing stipend. If you're smart about the stipend, you can set it up to completely pay off your house (this is what I did) and it can be valued anywhere from $20,000 to over $100,000 tax free. You also can stay in the Reserves and drill 2 days a month and for that receive full family medical benefits and a modest pension starting at age 60.   Overall, it's *highly* worth doing. If you or anyone reading this is seriously interested, DM me.

108a0o4,,j3vowrc,Yeah realistically only white folks could move to majority white towns. Just the way it is. If I was black I'd try going to MS or AL. Lots of affordable homes in the black belt. And lots of affordable homes in NM if you're hispanic.
108a0o4,,j3vebig,Yeah, I've had at least two near death experiences with racists while being homeless.   1st, when I was waiting for my friend to rescue me from my abusive ex's family. It was a primarily white neighborhood, and a lynch mob was forming. My friend arrived just in time before they could do anything.  2nd, when I was placed in an apartment by an anti-homelessness organization. I was heckled by a racist white karen, because I was looking at a stray cat on the wall. She was trying to call the police on me, and I think even start a physical altercation. Managed to defuse the situation. The apartment's still dangerous towards PoC and women.   Both were some of the most terrifying moments of my life. I would NEVER anywhere near right wing or white neighborhoods. I don't have a death wish.

108a0o4,j3uvbvo,, I want to chime in for people who are serious considering getting out of homeless or car living whatever your situation. First really look into HUD housing, forecloused and bandos do not think you do not qualify. And damn near anything can be rehabbed.   People tend to sneer but I know some people who moved into rust buckets, and small run down towns do not knock it.

I am 47, have a criminal record (one count of federal wire fraud which ultimately I only received 36 months probation)..  I have a check for $3,517 which is useless because I tried to deposit it to my Chime account and endorsed the back for deposit only, chime did not accept the check only reason was unable to verify the details of the check  In NYC where I am its impossible for me to find work due to my age, not having worked for 2 years

That's like saying you're a "car owner" when you got 50 monthly payments due on your car, and they can tow it anytime you stop paying.  If you stop paying your mortgage, you WILL be evicted and the bank will take its house back.

107sq2n,,j3p7v8l,Definitely. I'm not sure what else to advise OP they need other than realistic expectations about SSDI. Basically, they need to act as if they have no prospect of an income source, and if the SSDI comes through then that's just a lucky break.

Trick is to get a lawyer after the second time they turn you down to take it to court as soon as they can. Lawyers take a portion of your back pay but are limited in what they can take.
107sq2n,,j7i980l,It is very hard to prove a Mental Disability without some current diagnosis from several psychiatrist. It also helps if you have been involuntarily committed as well. A history of unstable behavioral issues needs to be consistent as well. I say current diagnosis because you cannot apply for SSI or SSDI with a diagnosis you had when you were a child. You need a current diagnosis and Psychological Evaluation

It was a fight just to get my bank to accept it, and having a PO box can kind of help but it feels like half of places also reject that too. For instance at least in my state they won't let you donate plasma to make extra money if the address is a hotel, regardless of how long you've been there. If you have no other options I would go with a PO Box but if you can see if a friend or old neighbor will let you use their address and collect mail from them?

107s91j,j3sjyj0,,Employers definitely will discriminate against you if they suspect you're homeless. Ask around local shelters if they know of any places that will offer you a free address that you can receive mail to.

107s8ns,j3pogsd,,Thank you for showing this man kindness. A lot of people wouldn't do nearly as much as you have.  That said, as a (well, homeless) woman myself, I kinda see that he might have just been awkward with what he asked you and meant no harm, but living how I do, I've met/know plenty of homeless, and sadly a lot of them panhandle due to drugs but aren't above doing whatever to get money, I really wish people weren't so stereotypical as I myself only panhandle, I ask for shit I don't take.   You've done your part, you need to take care of yourselves, I think if you can find a tactful way to either ask him to leave or have someone else do it that would be best. (It'd be nice if you could avoid the police but I wouldn't risk your own safety to do it.)  Thank you again for being kind, and I hope it works out, be safe.
107s8ns,j3wq3oh,,OP here, thank you all for the advice. Things have progressed! Yesterday we made a plan to let him know he had to leave, as my roommate was leaving for work at 10am he was jacking off right outside our door, fully exposed, nothing covering him. I bought him a coffee, wrote down the nearest shelters and their cross-streets and told him that we cut him some slack with the snow but the snow‚Äôs melting and he can‚Äôt stay here. We said we would call the police if he didn‚Äôt move and he said thanks for looking out for him.   We take out the trash an hour later, he‚Äôs gone. I step outside 3 hours later and he‚Äôs back and jerking off again. Now there‚Äôs two people that have seen him naked and exposed.   We called the police, told him we called the police, and he ran off but left his things. We all agreed we were going to clean up his stuff the next day when its lights outside.   I came home from work last night at 10:15 and he was gone, my roommate texted us as he left for work this morning and he‚Äôs back.   He‚Äôs no longer being respectful, and I hate the fact that i‚Äôve seen him naked. We‚Äôre at a stalemate now.
107s8ns,,j4asv1p,I‚Äôm sorry, but you are being way too nice, and this man is clearly taking advantage and getting off on your naivety, and testing how far he can push you.  You shouldn‚Äôt have gotten him a coffee after he did that, there is no excuse‚Äî if he‚Äôs savvy enough to know to be polite then slowly start asking questions about your home and parents, he‚Äôs not insane, he‚Äôs a fucking danger.  I get that it might feel bad at first, but you‚Äôre very young and should know this: sometimes as a woman you have to be a bitch to get your point across to someone who is taking advantage. And if you can‚Äôt be assertive here, you need to get a big/ strong/ tall/ intimidating male friend or family member to physically demand that he leaves and never comes back.   You aren‚Äôt his guardian Angel, and he clearly doesn‚Äôt give a shit about you or your sense of safety or dignity. Stand up for yourself and realize he isn‚Äôt a lost kitten, he‚Äôs a manipulative pervert who happens to be experiencing homelessness.   And mind you I am only talking about this specific man‚ÄîI think in general it is great to be kind, but you have to know to set boundaries when people show you who they are. Not everyone is as kind as you.
107s8ns,,j3wrdbc,Holy shit, sorry that happened. I think we were all kinda hoping he‚Äôd continue to be respectful but I guess not. Good for you for dealing it with it so we‚Äôll!!
107s8ns,,j3x2z62,that‚Äôs what we were hoping too! we all wanted to give him the benefit of doubt, every other person we‚Äôve interacted with outside our house has been respectful and nice so we didn‚Äôt expect anything less
107s8ns,,j499oyw,Call the cops without warning him. Let the cops know he has been told to leave multiple times . Let them know he exposes himself and jacks off in front of you. Don't warn him.  Cops may not be able to do much the first time, but after if you have to call again it will be on record and he won't be able to bypass trespassing twice.   If you get lucky he may even have warrants.   This guy sounds dangerous. All your doing now is pissing him off.
107s8ns,,j4atrh3,Any update?  Did you manage to shift the bloke?  Do whatever you have to to get rid of him.  He‚Äôs clearly not a safe person to have near your house.  I hope it works out okay for you all
107s8ns,j3obwrd,,Lol maybe this is a sign to take his advice and get a large dog and a gun. And you can also take precautions to make your doors more secure, just google them. And if the intruder doesnt have a gun themselves, usually they'll run at the first sight of one. Except they cant run cause you'll have a big ass dog üòÜ  As far as your neighborhood, 99% of people outside will leave you alone and would greatly appreciate your assistance, but if you're worried about the 1% (and I dont mean that sarcastically) then I would invest in some mace and/or a CCW. If the one guy in particular is bothering you, just be direct without being disrespectful and ask him nicely to  go to a shelter. You could even offer to take him there. But I would say its not safe to let a stranger who's asking invasive questions and knows all of your schedules to stay literally at your back porch. Plus 3/4 of you are women? Yeah nah fuck that. Sorry but you have to ensure your own safety first.
107s8ns,j3oc2ry,,Nah; you've been as accommodating as any stranger has a right to expect.    As to the 'best way,' of course it depends on the individual, but for the most part I tend to just prefer being talked to as an equal, or as close to it as circumstances allow.  You said that some of his comments were scaring you.  Coming from the other side, what could **he** have done differently to be less of an imposition on you?
107s8ns,j3pc5f1,,You sound like very decent people. Keep being decent. Talk to him, as a group, and find out what his deal is. Explain that you allowed him to stay while the weather was terrible but he must move on now. If you have something that can help him, offer it. Treat him like a human being and give him the chance to act like one. If he starts to behave badly, then escalate. Not before. Good luck and thanks for being kind.

107s8ns,j3orulx,,> today he asked if we had any dogs in the house (we don‚Äôt) and he said ‚ÄúWhat, no guardians?‚Äù.  Oh, jeez...  I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt here and assume this guy is just clueless when it comes to interacting with people. So I'd probably try use that as a way to start a longer conversation with him. Like, walk by his camp with at least one of your other roommates and try to catch his attention, then bring it up and tell him how saying things like that comes across to a young woman. After that, keep the conversation going and really try to figure out what kind of person he is. He may be a very good guy, in which case it can be a benefit to have him staying there if your place is a thoroughfare. That may even be what he was hoping to say with the guardian comment, however badly it came out.  If you keep getting bad vibes, though, then you just have to ask him to leave. Personally, I never call the cops under any circumstances, but I get it if you feel you need to. But maybe consider going down as a group (all four of you that live there) and asking him about it. Try to think of this as mutual support for each other, not a way to intimidate him. And try to remember that no one's all bad (or all good), we're just complicated.  Good luck and stay safe. This is not an easy situation, but I think you're being really thoughtful about it, which is great.
107s8ns,j3p1978,, You have been kind enough to a fellow human, everything has its end.   Tell him he needs to move on, or call the Police, you can even say my landlord says you need to go.
107s8ns,,j3p6qsb,I second the landlord idea
107s8ns,j3q3wl7,,Call the cops, ask him to move, secure your entrances and keep a weapon handy.   That question just invalidated his welcome.   Regardless of his intent, he's now declared himself a potential threat, protect yourself.
107s8ns,j3pdtce,,I‚Äôd cut that shit out right away. Call the cops or physically remove him. Now is not the time to be soft.
107s8ns,j3rfnmc,,Crowbar to the knee-cap!!!  ......or, you know- TELL him to leave.......
107s8ns,j3rgzej,,I don't like it.  As the time gets friendlier, intentions can become more sinister. The comment on the guardians is very concerning.  I think if I was in your position. I think you and your roommates should nicely talk to him of his intentions. Then I think you should tell him almost exactly what you shared here.  That it's sorta a pass through spot. And that they like it that way, so they can help others as well. but I would be honest and tell him it's about time to start thinking about moving on.  If you get a lot of kickback. Then I would mention how his comment about guardians has everyone uneasy, that your not assuming anything but ask him to put himself in ur shoes. Lots of homeless are really empathic, good, kind, accepting people.  I think that's how some of them simply survive by being agreeable.  Lots of opinions, and their like assholes. So your know where It goes.  I wouldn't do this alone.
107s8ns,j3xu1zs,,call the cops
107s8ns,j3pv435,,I agree with all of the above advice saying it might be worth starting a conversation and escalating if it doesn‚Äôt go well. If you‚Äôd rather not call 911, depending on your city, a 311 system can also get this taken care of. In my city (U.S.)  they send outreach first to offer services and only send police if there is no other alternative.

107s8ns,j3r0zz6,,Get one of those fake security cameras and put it up.  Hell,  a real one probably costs the same price. If not for him, for the others. Don't let your home become an uncomfortable place for anyone.  It's good to see the human in people and have compassion. But he has crossed the line and needs to move. If he doesn't respect your space and won't leave, make the call.
107s8ns,j3tglew,,yikes. I don't think you've been homeless if you seriously think cops are the answer
107s8ns,j42eq6l,,praying for you, its 2023 I am certain the situation you are in will change and you will have housing.
107s8ns,j3of54b,,Is this guy actually on your property? If he‚Äôs not then there‚Äôs not really anything you can do.
107s8ns,j3pwkdq,,He's a human, just like you, just explain everything you just posted here to him and if doesn't leave THEN call the cops. Give him a chance, i was homeless for 7 years and i always was respectful of people. I'm not him but I'd just tell him how you feel and what you want. Be polite and non-threatening.  Offer a small gift of tobacco or food before you start talking to him.
107s8ns,j3qi0ke,,You mentioned that this guy has been there for a couple of days because it's warm and it's snowing. I've been homeless and out on the street one time during a snow storm. I found any place that was warm enough for me to stay. And if someone came along that 'not another homeless guy's look. A simple 'excuse me'' from me meant I'm not THAT type of homeless...and they would ask am I alright.  Do not call the cops. Talk to him like a human being and ask him that you have some people who might be coming over or whatever. Mention a shelter... But winter time, they fill up fast and turn people away.   You also mentioned that others just past thru, eat and smoke there too. Is it dirty, do you have to clean it up yourself? If it's not dirty and you aren't cleaning it or no one in the house isn't cleaning it... What does that say. That your house is cool, don't leave your mess garbage on their back area because they are somewhat allowing us to do our thing. It a code out there with the homeless and most stick to it and go by it.
107s8ns,j3r735p,,I disagree with most here it seems to me as he is just asking it innocently.   If he‚Äôs an older guy he probably just saw young people and was worried about you guys living in a bad area.  If he himself looks younger than yes I would be worried.
1071bm3,j3jwj4e,,Good on your tenacity to survive.  What kind of goals do you want to set for yourself for the 2nd year?
1071bm3,,j3jye0q,I've mostly been trying to find a solution on where i can safely sleep and live. I was on the move most of last year and I have just been rolling the dice sleeping in public where i happen to be that night. It's incredibly lucky something bad hasn't happened to me yet.
1071bm3,,j3nhn4w,Same situation,  i found an old dilapidated and entirely abandoned house on the edge of a woods. Been living out of it. Maybe use google maps to try and hunt down an abandoned place to squat?
1071bm3,,j3z66mu,That's really neat you're lucky! I did live in the woods in a tent for a while but it wasn't viable to walk for hours to a food bank every week
1071bm3,j3kxw1m,,Lucky you! I was homeless from 1997 till 2004, raccoons tried to eat me twice!! They're huge when they get up close!
1071bm3,,j3plvwv,I've encountered some big racoons in my time. At the last camp I had, we had a problem with rats the size of a small cat.
1071bm3,,j3z5rvs,Oh close I was homeless from 1999 until 2004, you got me beat by a year still haha üòÅ. They're dangerous I'm glad you are okay!
1071bm3,,j4045cy,I used to go to laundromats and dry my jacket and kinda doze off. Nice and warm.
1071bm3,,j4ejog4,That sounds awesome! No such luck here yet. Last winter I got the go ahead by an employee to use the showers at a gym before opening
1071bm3,,j4eoodn,When i lived in BC there was a place where there were 3 showers and you could pay 1 dollar for 20 minutes of shower, one year on my birthday the guy i lived under the bridge with took like 80 bucks worth of loonies and we spent most of the day in there(in seperate stalls)laughing and chatting lol it was a great birthday.
1071bm3,,j4jvga0,Haha I bet he felt on top of the world üòÇwhat i wouldn't give for a shower. The others showering must've thought he was on something.
1071bm3,,j4jzh9g,Haha yeah we were both in there in separate stalls but they were side by side so we couldn't see each other but we could hear each other perfectly, we smoked a bunch of BC bud in the shower stalls and hung out in there the whole day, when we told all our homeless friends what we did they, of course, insinuated that we were having a homosexual romp in there, we weren't, but even if we had what the fuck is the big deal, some people enjoy men, we were not ones who did, but it would have been fine if that's what we felt like doing, it was a super fun birthday. Oh i know, it's crazy the things you miss when you're homeless, showers, being able to eat whenever you feel, being able to take a nap or be warm or not get wet in the rain or not get told to "get a job" 10 million times a day lol maybe if i had, a shower, a bed, an alarm clock, bus fare or a vehicle, clean clothes, a resume then maybe i could but you just telling me to "get a job" is not helping in any way whatsoever.
1071bm3,,j57s7ol,Yeah and on top of not having transportation, bed, clean clothes, razor, you also feel very terrible mentally. Even if I had all the tools necessary to look decent for a job, I wouldn't feel like it. It's a tough battle you need to overcome within yourself before you can even consider working a job.
1071bm3,,j58i6f8,And working barely keeps us alive while the few at the top get richer off our labor, they have more money than they'll EVER be able to spend, i wish i had Elon Musk money, I'd open up tons of shelters and run them right and open needle exchanges and safe consumption sites and lobby the government to make mental health care actually compassionate etc. etc.
1071bm3,,j5crex6,Tell me about it.. I worked shitty minimum wage jobs for a solid 20 years straight and what did I get for it? Pennies that vanished in a few short months until there were nothing left. It's so unfair and those that have a lot don't share and don't do anything good with it. They rather let it accumulate endlessly for nothing.
1071bm3,j3lm1fr,,I'm glad to know that you did. Keep it up!
1071bm3,,j3z3cbo,Thank you!
1071bm3,j3mr5x6,,If you can survive that you can survive anything! Try calling 2-1-1 for help. They can direct you to services for the homeless.
1071bm3,,j3z3apm,Thank you I have gotten help previously
1071bm3,j3khecj,,Does Security give you a hard time?
1071bm3,,j3z4hg1,Yes most. The other week they woke me up in the middle of the night told me to leave when it was snowing freezing outside. Though some have been very friendly and one even got me a coffee.
1071bm3,,j3zak5r,Well I try to be one of the friendly ones. I try to live under the philosophy of if I can't help you, I'm at least going to try not to hurt you. The only time I will dislodge homeless people, if they're not causing a disturbance, is if management orders me to, And even then I'll point to an area where the cameras can't see you because you know God forbid management actually gets up and looks around instead of just looking on the cameras.
1071bm3,,j4ejzeo,More security guards needs to be like you, believe it or not most homeless people just want a warm place to sleep at and be left alone without creating a scene.
1071bm3,j3oy9gf,,congrats. almost 4 months for me
1071bm3,,j3z37k3,Good job sir or miss
1071bm3,j3mawb4,,Well put yah on the list and get that trophy sent right to yah.

106qgix,j3i292f,,Seek help at a hospital or police station.
106qgix,,j3nkvmd,Thank you I'll talk to the police. Thanks for advice
106qgix,j3iy2le,,If you are under 18 couldn‚Äôt u call social services on your parents or are the laws different in Germany about child neglect. Germany is pretty good about taking care of the homeless. In Berlin, they will provide you with housing. I think u have the tools u need, just need to make use of them
106qgix,,j3nlb4n,Yeah its like that in germany. But I dont like the system its like idk noone gets what he deserves. I did like 1 year of work in one of those social services and much people called us cause germany didn't pay them off. All people in germany know that its like this but noone will do something against it. So yeah I dont trust those services. But I'll try. Btw Berlin is like on the other side of germany
106qgix,j3lvrbb,,How is this possible in a Northern European socialist utopia?
106qgix,,j3nm1kt,I dont know bro but it looks like it is. Cause noone knows of it noone will do something until I talk to them. But I think when I talk to the organisations I will get help so uhm. Normally this doesn't happen but when it happens you normally find helo very quickly.
106qgix,j3lbkga,,Call social services.  You are still under 18, so it can be easier. Google homeless shelters and help organisations.  (Does Germany have the Salvation Army?) If they give out, try get a proper jacket,,shoes, hat etc. Because its tough being homeless in the winter (I know)  If you cant find anything, try finding something thats night open so you can stay inside, some burger restaurans can sometimes be kind and let homeless be there in the night, or gas stations.
106qgix,,j3nls7j,Oh thanks for that good advice. I'll try that if my ex kicks me out too (he told me I could stay at his place until I found a new basement or some help of organisations)
106qgix,j3m7ot2,,What about a therapist and a case worker. At least one of those because they can point you towards the resources that could benefit you in your new situation. I‚Äôm in a different country so please forgive me if this is a bad suggestion. Hang in there.
106qgix,,j3nmf7q,No thanks its a good advice. I can go to my ex therapist who talked to me when I still was in therapy cause of my depression. Also was in a psychiatric facilty two years (13-15 year of my live). Maybs I'll go there again. Thanks for your advice
106qgix,j3juea6,,Advice is be nice to your parents.
106qgix,,j3nlczg,Okay I'll try. Thanks for the advice
106qgix,j3l0ou0,,Stop lying dumbass.
106qgix,,j3nljuv,I am sorry if you got rude cause of me. But I didnt lie. But think what you want to think. I dont talk to people who call me "dumbass" or sth
106qgix,,j3p4m54,You posted that you always lie.  Stop lying!
106qgix,,j4az8tw,Uhm okay?
106ozdj,j3k2als,,When I slept in a storage for like 2 weeks,I had vise grips.I just tightened them on the latch from inside.Impossible for anyone to open up unexpectedly.
106ozdj,,j3kx8kc,Genius
106ozdj,j3kzcd0,,Just do not sleep there if food is also stored there. I had a client who slept in his storage unit until he was attacked by rats because he was keeping food in there with him.
106ozdj,j3k86u9,,safe nearby residential or business streets, local businesses, churches, charities with off street lots. ask for permission first.
106ozdj,j3ieqeh,,Is this a short term plan? I would make sure that the storage unit doesn‚Äôt lock their gates during certain times to where you would be stuck.  You can get a pass to a gym to shower and use the restroom for cheap. (Planet fitness, crunch fitness)   You‚Äôll probably have to park your car down the street and walk to the storage unit.
106ozdj,,j3k8j2g,Most if not all storage places have gates. I've been to different places. Can't access without a code. Also cameras are everywhere. I don't know if they are monitored. I've seen only one attendant at places i visited and they are not always at the front desk.
106ozdj,j3ixetb,,Don't they have cameras everywhere? I know around my way they do. and they have someone sitting at the front desk all night.
106ozdj,,j3nh0f0,Most places have cameras but they cannot see into the individual units. So if someone was *really* paying attention they would see you arrive and not leave, but people are rarely paying that much attention.
106nmot,j3hj6cs,,Use the closest Post Office address.  (Your name) General Delivery (Post office address)
106nmot,j3i6psy,,See if there‚Äôs a homeless resource anything near you. They should be able to help you get that done
106nmot,j3id7h3,,I got my car registered with an old address on my ID, I‚Äôm worried because my DL expires this year and I live in my car. I‚Äôll use the same address again if I can
106nmot,j3lop79,,If it cannot check and see if your state is one of those states that will allow you to use the address of the post office and then put the number of your post office box, kind of like an apartment...
106nmot,j3hhskc,,You don't need a bunch of strangers on the internet to tell you that's illegal.
106hvr2,j3gr1bg,,Best way to find what homeless folks need is to ask them. They might be good on food but need shoes. A ride across town can be a lifesaver. A trip to the laundromat can make their month. I have people I give money to regularly, because money is what drives our society in America. A night in a motel with a bag of food is like a trip to the beach. Socks are always great. I have a friend that bring a bag of books to every couple of weeks. $1 cup of coffee from Mcdonalds is usually welcome.
106hvr2,,j3gv7rz,the laundromat thing is a GREAT idea!
106hvr2,,j3hhpk7,A place to change is welcomed as well. Hard to wash what your wearing, and A lot only have what they wear.
106hvr2,j3htbuc,,If you truly desire to help, then be present with people. And I mean every individual you encounter. What I mean by this is that you have no idea what someone is going through and a bit of empathy could save them from going down a dark rabbit hole with no hope and escape.   Learn more about what is going on in the structures, read more about the topic and other topics and see how they relate to one another.   Giving items out of course is always helpful in the here and now. But if you really want to be helpful to the situation, you would need to challenge the current structures in place. Realize there will be retaliation but do not falter..  Long-term stability will work out for everyone...
106hvr2,j3guy21,,oversized comfy hoodie sweaters  water  waterproof tarps  hiking backpacks  wet wipes  beanies  wool socks  hiking boots  solar power outlet  adult diapers  dry shampoo  bars of soap  survival books  Pamphlets with local resources (you can research and make one yourself to hand out)  local street map  comic book bible  prepaid phone for 6mos to a year (you can get them cheap)  gloves  long wide scarf (not the skinny ones) - so it can be used as a blanket
106hvr2,,j3h8aka,I've seen solarpower backpacks, how's that sound? Might do a little gift bag with that with the toiletries you mentioned. I have a couple really huge tarps that could be cut up as well. I was also thinking like a wawa or sheetz gift card wpuld be handy. Thanks for your input!
106hvr2,,j3hjbyz,For most people without a home, both storage and being limited on what they can carry are issues. The simplest and most respectful way to give is either asking individuals what they need or giving cash so they can provide for themselves.
106hvr2,,j3qxj4a,the problem is though they don't know what they need until they need it...
106hvr2,,j3umcfz,‚ÄúComic book bible‚Äù??????
106hvr2,j3hrt5l,,I understand the stance of not giving money because of addiction, but this is one of those falsehoods that people like your father have perpetuated for decades. You can look it up and find \*TONS\* of studies that say otherwise. The absolute best way to help someone who is homeless is with cash.  (Here's) \[[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21528569/homeless-poverty-cash-transfer-canada-new-leaf-project](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21528569/homeless-poverty-cash-transfer-canada-new-leaf-project)\] a study from 2021 in Canada on the subject.
106hvr2,,j3j06mj,Agreed. Also, this might sound fluffy and silly but it isn‚Äôt: People need connection and friendship. Unsheltered people, especially those who have substance use disorders, have burnt many if not all of their bridges, and surviving on the street is hard, there are not many people who are out to help or who won‚Äôt harm them even. So striking up a real, non transactional friendship with somebody can help you discover how to really help that person. Of course, you can‚Äôt do that with every person you encounter on the street, but certainly with one or two. Try it!  I‚Äôve done this through my work in this field and have found it such a beautiful learning experience.
106hvr2,,j3kefxt,Sometimes there's no bridges to burn. The good people you meet are far and few between. Unless you're into committing crimes to support your habit it won't really be so much you doing a lot of drugs. It'll be you have so little and to kill time you're willing to spend $10 on dope instead of other things because shit sucks anyway. It's boredom that'll consume you.
106hvr2,,j3hs2tu,Yea agreed, I love my father but you're right. I'll consider adding that in. I think I want to also add a personal touch though as well. Cash is great but it's also very impersonal.
106hvr2,,j3ht14m,I'n not discouraging you from doing something more, by all means, any help is beneficial, but imo if you want a personal touch, talk to them. Have an actual conversation. Ask them what they need. Pick the amount of money you're giving them based on what they tell you.      If they say they need $100 to make it through to the end of the month, and you then give them that $100 (or more if you're feeling generous), it doesn't get much more personal than that. You're likely to make someone cry of happiness, depending on how hard their situation is at the time. You may literally be saving their life.
106hvr2,,j3ighzb,Another way to think about weather cash is a good idea to give someone is to ask yourself "what country does this person live in?"  If it's the United States, then there isn't anyone here that doesn't need cash.
106hvr2,,j3kduf6,Yeah. Even if I ever got anything like $20 or more the majority wasn't going to substances at all. Of course I'm nowhere near where others are in terms of drugs or alcohol. $5 is a gram of weed or a tall can of alcohol. $15 is food and whatever immediate item I need the most. Socks, lighter, clothing from the thrift store, toiletries, coffee so I can sit inside when it rains. I'd never blow $20 just to get high if somebody gave that to me. It's a waste and it's short lived. If I really want to party I'll go do some temp labor and even then I'm not spending all my money on garbage. It's nice to feel like a human being and have a breakfast, coffee, and a cigarette or two. Although I'll never turn down free alcohol if somebody is cool to hang out with. I'm pretty good at returning the favor.
106hvr2,j3id4ma,,Gift card from like WAWA'S,  Racetrack, McDonald's,  Kohl's., Walmart. This way they can get what they need.
106hvr2,,j3if6lq,Just get a visa or Mastercard gift card. Cash is better, but a universal gift card that is a non-reliadable debit card is WAY better than some store based one.  At one point I was working a full time job. They gave us gift cards for various restaurants, places that I NEVER EVER EVER go. Those cards I lost eventually, and add a result were never used.  They also gave us gift cards for stores that I never go to, like kohls. It was the WORST gift card they could have given me. I go to goodwill for my clothes, as I couldn't afford kohls, and the gift card was so small that even 1 article of clothing from Kohl's would be more expensive than that card.
106hvr2,j3j0fe0,,Op you are amazing! Thank you for caring
106hvr2,j3jc2bj,,Hotel for the night to shower, charge devices, & wash clothes.
106hvr2,j3jmg2d,,Best way? genuine, consistent human interaction, not tainted by pity and an inroad toward community, resources and a vision of life outside of homelessness. results may vary depending on individual basis re: addiction, mental illness and trauma.  second best way?: everything merky-context9380 wrote.
106hvr2,j3hiyju,,If you want to "humanize" homeless people then stop seeing them as likely addicts. Cash is the most useful and versatile thing you can give. It really bothers me when people say they want to help and that they don't look down on homeless people but also think homeless people need to be treated like untrustworthy children.
106hvr2,,j3hkcnp,You're right, I'm sorry. I have a cousin who has struggled with addiction all his life, I just know that it's a really powerful grip and that there are lots of people who would rather scream to get a job than give a buck, which imo is part of the root cause for their addiction. I don't want to contribute to that cycle of suffering, which is why my post is phrased the way it is. That and my upbringing, but the two aren't exclusive so take that fwiw.  I don't mean to be prejudiced here and it's something I'm trying to learn not to do so thanks for pointing that out and giving me the opportunity to learn and grow. I think maybe the best advice I've seen here is to just get to know the people I'm trying to help out, would it be rude to ask how they got in the state they're in, maybe not as directly as that but just in general?
106hvr2,j3jub8o,,As someone who has been helping a homeless person I would say don't second guess yourself when it comes to giving. If you are giving, you are doing enough. Even a small amount. If you starting asking your self that question too much it will get to you. Someone told me to put my ego aside. Its easy to want to be the hero and save the day, but these serious issues are not easily solved. So do what you can. It will be enough

106dh85,j3gaedc,,This is not a subreddit to complain about homeless people at homeless people.  Why do people with houses see a tent encampment and think that's an appropriate place to dump a broken washing machine and some particle board furniture? Why do people with houses think "homeless people" are a giant monolith who are homeless for the same reason, all do the same problematic things and somehow have control over what other homeless people do? Why do people with houses complain about the problems homeless people cause, and wonder why homeless people don't fix those problems for you? Why do people with houses point out how a problem clearly affecting other people affects you, then follow it up with sentiment of not wanting to help solve that problem because they don't deserve the help?  If the problem bothers you, you need to help fix it, even if it might also accidentally help people you hate.  Sorry someone lied about why they need money at the gas station. Sorry someone threw out the leftovers you gave to them when they thought you had walked away. Sorry someone screamed at you in the bus. Sorry someone with no trash service didn't have a place for their trash.  The people leaving needles on the ground were probably too busy being addicted to intravenous drugs to worry about your problems and how it would damage your paper-thin sense of empathy and compassion.  Lucky for them, it probably wasn't worth much anyway.
106dh85,,j3gfki4,If only there was an r/housed sub where we could go and ask these questions.  EDIT: Oh shit, apparently there is. I should have known. Too bad it's dead. I really thought more people had houses.
106dh85,,j3gfstu,2 members. That barely exists.
106dh85,,j3kswzp,A huge Amen to you! What you said is priceless.
106dh85,,j42pzug,You can still dispose of trash in acceptable places when addicted to drugs‚Ä¶
106dh85,,j42yd1h,Sometimes. Sometimes you're so far gone that you can't make a good decision literally to save your own life, let alone to keep your immediate area tidy. You don't see the needles/trash/piss bottles/poop of the people who do it right. Heck some of the people are picking up the slack for other people. Their disregard for keeping the community clean is just as irksome to other homeless people as it is to everyone else, but the problem gets blamed on "the homeless". Even illegal dumping from housed people gets lumped in with "the homeless."  I guarantee, nobody in that tent encampment has a blue velvet couch or a bunch of used sheetrock. (Well, I guess they do *now*)  There's people just as messy as "Needles On The Ground" guy, but they get to hide their mess inside homes where you don't see them. Sometimes you'll see the insides of their cars. Sometime you'll see the aftermath of an avalance of trash getting kicked out of the foot well as they go to get more fast food.  There's all kinds of reasons people littler. If we solved problems that lead people to living on the street and/or becoming addicted to drugs and had better resources for those people that didn't involve things like "a place to sleep, but you have to get rid of all your stuff" or "free drug treatment, but if you're addicted to drugs we kick you out" as sure we'd solve the problems of people who don't deserve it, but hey, you wouldn't have needles on the street to step over. You deserve that right?  Now what really bakes my noodle is when I see a pile of purposely bent needles. Here is a person who was considerate enough to render their used needle inoperable so it can't be reused by someone else, to avoid spreading disease. But also a person without the consideration not to leave the needles on the god damn ground?

106dh85,j3vg7br,,That‚Äôs simply ridiculous. Homeless don‚Äôt buy trash cans, much less even use them. My city gave them some, someone crawled inside and OD‚Äôd in one, then the encampment burned the rest of them. Melted plastic everywhere.
106dh85,j3gb276,,It‚Äôs almost like when you‚Äôre not afforded the proper facilities to live your life like a dignified human being, you stop giving a shit.
106dh85,,j3z3cml,Oh boo fucking hoo, people won‚Äôt just give you what you want for absolutely nothing in return. Grow up and do something useful for once.
106dh85,,j45adjq,Local parks in my area don‚Äôt even pick up the trash on a schedule anymore‚Ä¶got terrible during Covid, especially the Graveyards.   People eventually got together though and started helping out, but that‚Äôs all done with now.   As far as trash bins‚Ä¶ There used to be an additional bin on one end of the closest park to me, but that one disappeared.  Another one, under a pavilion, well‚Ä¶someone did not think before dumping out left overs from the grill. Melted plastic and charcoal, aluminum was  pretty much all that was left of that bin‚Ä¶besides the cable lock.  Other than that, some teens broke one of the picnic tables (kinda already broken a bit), but jumping on the metal top and collapsing it didn‚Äôt help.
106dh85,j3kulrm,,People go backpacking all the time yet somehow never seem to leave any trash behind even though there is no trash can within 30 miles.  they pack it in and pack it out, It‚Äôs called ‚Äúno trace‚Äù.  why can‚Äôt the homeless do this as well?
106dh85,,j458otm,I‚Äôve always seen and picked up trash when hiking and such‚Ä¶there‚Äôs always a trace.  It‚Äôs statistically impossible to have people using trails and not leave a trace.  There‚Äôs quite a difference (rather large) between a ‚ÄúRecreational Activity that‚Äôs planned‚Äù (Somehow 100% are not leaving any trace) and what you are assuming as those who happen to be homeless, who definitely are 100% at fault for all trash found in the vicinity of wherever they are).
106dh85,j3gm0r4,,Bold of you to assume houses individuals are the ones creating trash.   Homeless people? Aren't the ones that threw living room furniture and mattresses into the drainage ditches of my town, which contributed significantly to the damage caused during the Father's Day flood a few years back.   It was the people who live in houses, and owned trucks to take their garbage out and dump at sites they figured didn't matter.   It was out of sight and out of mind - until it wasn't.   The homeless individuals in your city? Don't have a monopoly of creating trash and drug abuse, but they're less able to defend themselves, and it's socially acceptable to assume they're the problem, so you are.  You say you really wanted to help the homeless population...so are you providing them a way to throw out trash? It's funny to me that municipalities will hold spring clean-ups and rent dumpsters for neighborhoods a couple times a year, but for some reason giving the homeless a place to throw out trash that's maintained is often considered "enabling" them.   Also? Not every homeless person is a drug addict. There are plenty of people in houses throwing their drug-relates trash and needles out in inappropriate places, too. Again, the homeless are just an easy scapegoat to blame.   Do you have a needle exchange program that is advertised and accessible? If not, then you're more interested in placing blame than helping.   There are SO many solutions to this problem that aren't hateful and biased - all of which I would've tried before complaining to homeless people online about the homeless.  You don't seem glad to help them, but you do seem quick to make assumptions and place blame on a population that historically isn't as equipped to defend itself against your accusations...
106dh85,j3g37qq,,Um‚Ä¶you‚Äôre not exactly asking the correct questions or so it seems. (Perhaps you can clarify)  Why are you assuming Homeless people do this?  Do you mean addicted people, addicted people whom you assume to be homeless and or are homeless?  It seems the topic of discussion is focused on drug addiction‚Ä¶get together as a town, find out who, what, when, where, why , and how, the drugs are getting in.  Help or no help‚Ä¶the problem is ongoing in your community.
106dh85,j3klnok,,Housed people, police officers & trash officials are usually the ones who take the garage cans away from homeless people who buy them to keep area clean When they give up / stop buying them, that's when housed and haters say "SEE!? This is what homeless people do "
106dh85,j3glrii,,OP, Garbage is a utility that the homeless can't afford to pay for.  If encampments were issued some dumpsters and porta-potties, things would get less messy. Better for everyone.  It's shooting oneself in the foot to think that homeless people, including people struggling with mental illness, and/or people struggling with addiction: can afford to pay for sanitation.  They can't.  But many can put in a few minutes a day of picking up things--if they are \[helped with\] bags, gloves, receptacles.  It benefits literally the whole community.  Could keep a whole city safer.
106dh85,,j3vgued,We tried giving the big homeless encampment here portapotties,  hand washing stations  and trash cans. They overdosed in the Porta potty‚Äòs,  burned the trash cans. and threw the hand washing stations in the ditch.
106dh85,,j3wu47m,That's too bad.  Some encampments can manage, some can't.  There is one near my workplace that's well-managed.  (They have a few staff).  I'm guessing there are no more than 60 or 70 people there and that helps.  If it were 100s of people \[in one spot\], it would be much harder.  I still think they need portos and trash cans, because the alternative is worse.
106dh85,j3kajzy,,As a homeless volunteer, this is one of the more baffling issues. We literally give these folks garbage bags to clean up their camps with, and they will not use them! Not gonna say every camp, but well over half.  truthfully, I am convinced that many of these folks have simple reverted to a Feral state.
106dh85,,j49a5pd,Depression. Go to someone's house in serious depression and it will be trashed.  Many homeless wind up with serious depression from being out there
106dh85,,j4oi9fy,Way to stereotype people with depression. I know many people diagnosed with major depressive disorder.  NONE of their homes are ‚Äútrashed‚Äù.  Shame on you.
106dh85,,j4on1h4,I am diagnosed as well. The people you know must have meds that work really well for them because for many we wind up without enough energy to even walk a block to the store for food and go hungry with loaded ent cards, spend all day in bed because the thought of all the things we need to do paralyzes us with inaction.  There are different levs of depression, your friends sound like they are at the lightest end of chronic depression. The rest of us it's a whole different story. The word lazy likley came from folks interacting with people that had depression before there was a diagnosis. I've never met a "lazy" person who was not chronically depressed.
106dh85,,j4pd4zy,Never said they aren‚Äôt sick. Just disgusted at the assumption that EVERY depressed persons house is as trashed as a typical homeless encampment.
106dh85,,j4rek65,If I said every then I shouldn't have. I just got upset at someone who said every homeless person throws garbage in the street.
106dh85,j3g3op5,,This isn't really just an issue with homelessness. Plenty of your neighbors who do have houses where they keep their things safe and who even have regular trash pickup on their curbsides also throw garbage everywhere. It could be that it's invisible to you because it's not as concentrated, but look along the roadsides and in your parks and you'll see it.  If you want answers to why it happens, you'll have to ask your society as a whole.  Or maybe you think that the homeless should be more mindful about their garbage than the rest of your neighbors since you were all helping them so much. And maybe they are.
106dh85,j3hft7b,,Homeless or not, some people just don't care, I've been to trashy houses, trailer parks, even large nice homes that are run into the ground by college students. It's not just the homeless, some people just suck
106dh85,j3i9reb,,OP, the best way to understand the connection between trash, hoarding, self-medication/addiction, illness, sex work, violence, and survival skills that don't work in housing with extreme poverty/homelessness is to consider it _trauma information_.  The best example of this understanding is in Victor Hugo's fictional novel Les Miserables (Bishop Myriel). After Jean Valjean robs the bishop of all of his silverware, is captured by the police, and is returned to face the bishop, Myriel understands completely that theft is merely a means of survival for those who have nothing.  His response? "...you forgot, I said to take the candlesticks also."  That's great that your city provides a modicum of support for people experiencing homelessness. But a mountain of trauma cannot be answered adequately or authentically by a congregate shelter.  People need homes. Without homes, they will never heal.
106dh85,j3h3e60,,A person can barely move or function after taking heavy opiates, they also don't have a garbage truck coming to their lot every week if they're homeless.
106dh85,j3gxqj6,,Oh wow.... Really? Are you sure?  Im sorry for being homeless.... Don't help me because im leaving trash... Really?  You disgust me... Its HUMAN BEING!

106dh85,j3gmo5u,,we take out our trash daily at home.... we go through a lot... so I can imagine how homeless people have to deal with not having a receptacle that will provide service for you to get rid of daily trash  the city of SF hands needles out so I'm assuming maybe the city ur referring to is doing the same
106dh85,j52v21i,,If homeless people keep trashing no matter how much you help them not to do so then they should be arrested in my opinion. Then they should do community service to clean their mess and others for a few days so that they learn how respect the environment. Here in SF jail is not that bad after all. Free bed, free food, but in exchange you gotta do community service. How about that?

106cagz,j3gnxay,,Would you be willing to share which cultures you are using for reference, the ones with strong family and community structures and don‚Äôt have rampant homeless issues?  That is super interesting!
106cagz,,j3h2hag,A lot of Asian cultures have huge family bonds. It is normal for kids to still live with parents into their 20's.   A lot of the time, it is the parents being taken care of by the children when they get old.
106cagz,,j3h6rof,I‚Äôm very curious about this.   So with your response I just googled ‚Äúdo Asian cultures struggle with homelessness‚Äù because I don‚Äôt know what Op is referring to.   First result was Japan, which appears to have the lowest homelessness in the world. The article does go through a few problems that did cause homelessness in Japan (financial crash in 1990, and others). So further reading explains their problems in the past did exist, and it was rough because the cultural approach was that it was the persons sole fault fir being in that situation. However their homeless problems have been greatly improved, nearly controlled, with well planned governmental policies to help homeless. I skimmed two more sources, but did not find that references supporting that ‚Äústrong family or community structures‚Äù was the key.
106cagz,,j3i8v5c,Just to offer some additional insights here...  What OP is really talking about is the difference between cultures that value individualism over collectivism, vs collectivism over individualism. Family bonds are just a small part of the results of those social differences. Countries like Japan are more collectivist, as seen in the way laws and social customs are implemented to protect the many over the few, and yes, even as seen in the social importance of family bonds. America is one of the most individualist cultures on the planet. This cultural norm plays out in a lot of ways, from top to bottom. It's why legislators reject regulations that protect the many in favor of regulations that protect the few (example: no universal health care, limited social services, and major protections for the wealthy), and it also plays into the way people in America don't place major importance of things like caring for their elderly family members in their own homes on their own time, instead more frequently paying for someone else to do the work.   This is a HIGHLY studied topic, so hopefully this rewording of OP's thoughts can help you in your efforts to understand this dynamic more through studies and surveys.
106cagz,,j3libsp,Thanks for elaborating for me.
106cagz,,j3li6eo,South American culture has a really strong family unit.  Big generational families, lot's of cousin and second cousins, haha.  Africa too.  Asia has good family structure and support, but these days, tend to have smaller families.
106cagz,,j3n3r1v,I thought if the Hispanic cultures for sure!! They are famous for having strong extended families. However the homeless rates in Mexico are not great. )I confess I didn‚Äôt about any other hispanic countries on that one). Mexicos homeless situation is rather devastation, India too.   Thanks for the interesting conversation.
106cagz,,j3ogup3,Hispanic culture is tight like that.  How does Mexico address the issue?  Thanks for your thoughts, homie!
106cagz,j3gwom8,,My mom and I fight like crazy when we live together, can't say I blame her for not wanting me around. I do wish community support, beyond family, was more common and encouraged, but most people seem to lean toward stark financial individualism.  I know if I was well established, I'd share everything I could. Even in the situation I'm living in, I give more away than I have any business giving.
106cagz,j3ge79a,,Not with my personal experience- a phone with no active service and having misread the schedule thinking I was off, which was rightfully a no-call/no-show.
106cagz,j3hw3gw,,My bouts of homelessness were from not having a supportive family. I was tossed out at 16 to fend for myself even though I was still in high school and my mother was sick. I can see how your take has some validity but there are many reasons people become homeless. I never had a home I could go back to and no one to lean on. It does take its toll on me.

106cagz,,j3p3b6v,I learned a lot about myself and found a lot of confidence by finding the most efficient way to camp and live "on the fly"  Most people are terrified by the idea of being "homeless".... like your life is over, but that's when you really start living in the moment.  Nobody can threaten me with destitution.  If I don't have a house, I know how to make good money (legally) anywhere.

106cagz,,j3ub3ol,Thank you.  Well, it's not an easy lifestyle for everyone.  I like camping and hiking anyway, so it's not so difficult for me.  I stay out in nature as much as I can.  I find a really nice camping spot and usually just go into town for supply / errand missions.    These days I have a little house, but I still like to go camping out in the woods sometimes.
106cagz,j3k4nnc,,I got worried when I saw the title lol, but I think I get what you're saying here. Rugged individualism, yay. People are communal and we weren't meant to just constantly have to perform and get by on our own power. Everyone needs and deserves support, but we punish marginalized and struggling people by telling them they don't deserve help. Fucking heartbreaking and awful.  My experiences with homelessness were all rooted in not having safe people or a safe family. Coming from abuse predisposes you to a whole host of things, including falling into more unsafe relationships. And since housing isn't treated as a right in the US, it is very easy to slip through the cracks.  (also unrelated but wanted to pass along that gypsy is historically a slur unless you're romani, in which case ignore me. I didn't know that until recently when a friend told me and neither do probably most people in the US especially it's a word a lot of ppl use colloquially, so I don't wanna criticize you for not knowing. Mostly that's why I wanted to pass it along)

106cagz,j3igkwp,,You can still have capitalism, such as Japan has capitalism. Their society and culture does place an emphasis on families and filial duties, etc.  You can have communism, and Neighbors and children will inform on their parents and get them imprisoned, lose their jobs, get sent to re-education camps, etc.  Ultimately, the booming opportunities of the post-WWII era when America was factory to the world meant people could live on minimum wage and still manage having a home on their own due to lower population densities. That was short-lived.  But with mechanization, automation, computerization reducing the need for labor, and exponentially growing population due to reproduction, people living longer, urbanization, migration, and immigration, thus growing labor supply and housing demand, we now see low wages, unemployment, underemployment, skyrocketing housing costs.  Why deliberately keep growing the population when there is increasingly less need for their labor and increasingly more pressure on housing costs? Because it benefits special interests.
106cagz,j3i9lae,,I don't like the way you've worded this, OP, but I get what you are saying.   I mentioned already in another comment that I believe the issue you are grappling with is the cultural differences between collectivism and individualism.   The reason I don't like the way you've worded this is because "breakdown of the family unit" is a common dog whistle on the right meant to demonize people who don't fit what they consider to be the "traditional" family unit, like queer people, single mothers, and the poor.
106cagz,,j3lj7dn,I appreciate your concern...  perhaps I should have been more inclusive / sensitive... but the way I think of 'family' has nothing to go with gender, sexual orientation, etc...    I mean family in the broader sense, queer couple, single moms and dads, everybody.
106cagz,,j3ieqks,A family unit can be whatever‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt picking up anything political in the original post‚Ä¶ especially nothing demonizing‚Ä¶ I had a mother from a collectivist culture and a father from an individualistic culture. After my mother died, a lot of things changed, The original post, even the wording, resonated with me‚Ä¶ Sorry it didn‚Äôt resonate with you. where did you get the idea that this specific wording is demonizing?
106cagz,,j3ihxra,Like I mentioned, the phrase "breakdown of the family unit" is a right-wing dogwhistle used to demonize nontraditional people and families.   And the post does resonate with me as well! But words also matter, so I wanted to point that out. My other comment goes more in-depth about the difference between collectivist cultures and individualist cultures, if you are interested.
106cagz,,j3ilrex,I could go along with you if OP said traditional family unit, but Family unit is very vague‚Ä¶ Google the definition. Talking about a family unit brings things closer to home as well, literally and figuratively. That makes sense when talking about the psychology of being homeless, collectivism versus individualism makes sense as well, but that is talking about a larger-scale tendency. sociology. Feel free to give me a source. do you really think 0P is demonizing  non-traditional families? I see no reason to try to control his wording‚Ä¶ Because I understood the meaning immediately.  I went to a liberal university‚Ä¶ My current girlfriend is Chinese‚Ä¶ I know the terms collectivism and individualism, it doesn‚Äôt mean that everybody has to.
106cagz,,j3inex4,No no, I didn't say I think OP *meant* to use a right-wing dogwhistle, and I don't think OP is trying to demonize anyone. I'm just pointing out that such phrasing *is* used as a right-wing dogwhistle, and that such phrasing might elicit reactions that reflect such.   As far as psychology vs sociology, I don't think the line between social constructs and personal actions is a very thick line. There is almost always a trickle down (or up, depending on how you look at it) effect between how society behaves as a whole and how individuals within that society behave.   My MA is in interdisciplinary humanities, so I did a lot of studying on how these different approaches to knowledge intersect, and even directly interact, with each other. When people suggest that one discipline is strictly separate from another (within the humanities at least, which includes both psychology and sociology, and many more disciplines) they have often simply forgotten to see the forest for the trees.
106cagz,,j3klduz,You mean like these reactions? I didn‚Äôt know it was a dogwhistle. But I do know that the phrase ‚Äúright-wing dogwhistle‚Äù is a dogwhistle.

106cagz,,j3lipy2,It IS more prevalent in the United States, by far, despite that it's a 'first-world country"  For example Los Angeles, California and Bangkok Thailand has almost the same population (around 13 million) .... but Bangkok, Thailand has about 5,000 homeless and LA has over 65,000.

106b8mi,j3gt6tm,,sorry you lost your job... if I were you I would talk to a local job recruiter and see if they know of any companies that provide housing -- OR maybe they can help u find one out of your area that provides housing  OR  ask your job recruiter for a company that provides on the job training for a practical tech field such as electric works, construction, plumbing (and then just live out of your car or a friends couch or whatever) while you gain these life skills  you can't do it on your own -- a job recruiter has relationships with companies and you might find a good one that is willing to help  \-----------------------------------------------------------------  it's tough to survive if you have little means or don't have community support... the rising rent makes survival nearly IMPOSSIBLE and jobs are NEVER constant <-- always remember that. your most VALUABLE asset you have right now is your YOUTH  \--------------------------------------------------------------------------  IF YOU CAN'T FIND A GOOD JOB OPPORTUNITY  there's always the military (navy for travel - Air Force for ease) - it's a great option because they house you and feed you -- plus they offer benefits when you get out or you can make a career out of it  \----------------------------------------------------------------------  the main thing is you have to buy time to figure out what you're going to do with the rest of your life. don't get distracted by partying <-- this will bite you on your ass and will take valuable time away from you  not everyone you meet wants the best for you -- a lot of envious assholes in life who will smile at you and then plot against you  -- LIFE is FULL of them because life is competition and you would be surprised just how competitive people can be and how far they will go - these are DESPERATE times <-- remember that  also, make a community with your local Christian church :) <-- obligated to throw that in
106b8mi,j3gew1c,,Job Corps is an option. If you don't already have your GED or high school diploma, you can get it there, and you can learn a trade- the center I attended had security and protective services, carpentry, painting (as I houses), driving semi trucks, nursing, culinary arts and office administration I think- may have changed in the 13~ years since I finished.  You get a small amount of money every two weeks to buy the stuff you might need, like hygiene supplies, and it goes up the longer you're there. And when you leave called a transition allowence- if you only get your GED/diploma (or arrive already having it), it's $250, $1200 of you also complete your chosen trade.  From what i can remember l, it's self paced, at least to a certain extent. What might take one person a year to do, you might be able to do it in half that
106ad9c,j3fwme0,,As someone who has both been homeless and attended university/taught classes... When we‚Äôre attending university we‚Äôre full of promise and our hopes and dreams haven‚Äôt been crushed by reality yet. And when we‚Äôre teaching we know enough to know how easy it is to become homeless lol
106ad9c,j3g0ppx,,Mmm. I lived on-campus for two weeks, and it barely felt homeless. Vending machines always had coin because they didn't have eftpos yet, folk never finished their pizzas at the cafe, and student union did free meals three days of the week. Probably the only summer I slept in aircon, too.  God... can I go back?
106ad9c,j3gvw33,,Colleges have an endless supply of young, idealistic people who want to change the world.  They graduate and move away before compassion fatigue sets in.  Also liberals are statistically less generous than conservatives at the personal level with support for the poor. Liberals are more generous with laws that support the poor.
106ad9c,,j3jsssy,Interesting. You know, I've always wondered who would be more likely to buy a homeless person a sandwitch or give them a few bucks, a democrat or republican...  I like to watch social experiment vids of people asking for handouts. A lot of people will refuse but then, some random person will give them some food or a few bucks and I often wonder if that person was a liberal or conservative.
106ad9c,,j3jvedn,You have to remember that religion is a big motivator for people to aid homeless people.  As much as people think of the church as a bunch of hypocrites, the data shows that many religious people do care about the homeless and strive to be compassionate and help in an individual level.  Maybe not money but in other ways. You‚Äôll see churches provide alot of services too. However I‚Äôd be willing to bet many of the college kids that help homeless are either liberal or don‚Äôt know anything at all about politics. In fact, I can‚Äôt help but feel politics doesn‚Äôt play in to the decision too much when a person is face to face with someone suffering. I‚Äôd like to think for the most part, it‚Äôs the person‚Äôs character that would weigh more than politics.
106ad9c,j3j1xpp,,I agree with you. My uni was a college town and lots of homeless make the most of it. It‚Äôs considered the best school in the USA for sociology so yes definitely a lot of socialist including myself who are taught about how many people are born into poverty and how easily a working person could slip into homelessness. My uni had a Food bank on campus and at first I was embarrassed to go in but then when I got there people were beyond friendly and generous. We are all in this together‚Ä¶ that was a good feeling‚Ä¶ too bad I was depending on student loans to live there but my twin attended the same uni and even though he graduated, he‚Äôs never left the college town.
106ad9c,j3jivk3,,College towns just usually have a god vibe, its young (ish) energy and people who have not gotten jaded with the real world yet.
106ad9c,,j3jqjc0,Yeah, I can completely relate to that!. Back in the day when I was in my late teens, I felt like the smartest and healthiest person on Earth. I was going to live to be 100, change the World and felt like the entire planet was my playground. I was full of joy, ambition, dreams and every day felt like a fun adventure.  Then, I got old and over the years my eyes have been opened and I realized that not everything is as it appears to be and I am no longer that naive, ignorance-is-bliss, happy-go-lucky person and have become much more jaded...which is a shame because I used to be told all the time what a happy, friendly and cheerful person I was.  Growing up can sober a person up really quick.
1062kt7,j3eth48,,It‚Äôs something and definitely convenient as far as having a single additional location to house and provide services.  Necessary bathrooms, hvac, electric, fire systems and everything all likely up to code or at least more easily updated than perhaps other buildings would be.  Edit: My best, favorite apartment experience was actually an older hotel, converted into condos.  When my old shitty apartment complex rent was increased to $645 a month and I was still in college‚Ä¶I managed to find the studio for $450 that even included hot water!  I damn near twice got my monthly utilities under $20. Miss that little studio‚Ä¶was a simple, comfortable place.   I think the rates there now are like $900 minimum.
1062kt7,j3evbq6,,This is a step in the right direction ‚Äî if they don't keep people out through bullshit arbitrary rules and red tape.
1062kt7,j3fxfhf,,I've seen a lot of towns do this and all I can ever think of is Marie Antoinette saying "Let them eat cake!" Like some city councilperson was sipping their glass of wine and suddenly solved the homelessness problem: "Let them stay in hotels!"  I mean it just has no effect when you actually look at the number of rooms available against the number of homeless people.  And that's when I'm feeling generous. When I'm more cynical, I assume it's just a way of funneling government money to large property holders who made bad investments.
1062kt7,,j3jq3c8,95 people isn't nothing. And it's long term housing with kitchens, not like a short stay hotel
1062kt7,,j3oruye,Most of these podunk motels aren‚Äôt owned by large property owners, it‚Äôs mom and pops that have opened it in the 70s. I‚Äôm sure once it‚Äôs full of people for transitional housing, few would agree that it was a bad plan. We‚Äôve done it with a few other Denver hotels last year.
105zlvx,j3fi3si,,Keeping your windows cracked can help sometimes, but it depends on the climate you're in.  Personally, I just live with it and even appreciate the bit of privacy. It's a dead giveaway that someone's sleeping in there, though, of course. A dollar store "shower squeegie" makes wiping it off in the morning quick and clean.
105zlvx,,j3fl4j8,It was bucketing down all last night so kept the windows up, that‚Äôs probably why it was worse than usual. Still it happens even with all windows an inch down
105zlvx,j3fysje,,I don't have an answer but I will advise that you make sure to air out your vehicle regularly as vehicles can and will mold due to the added moisture of someone living in a vehicle for long periods and it can be in the spots you would never see but could cause you to get very sick and make your life harder.
105zlvx,j3ds9q9,,Been having the same problem, tried cat litter in a sock suggested by old reddit posts but hasnt worked.  I had some "damp rid" from the supply store but ive lost it, i may try that for my car.  &#x200B;  I was thinking that a candle may help but am unsure, i think some of those old posts suggested rubbing some isopropyl alcohol on the screen itself before sleep.
105zlvx,,j3g1ig0,Careful with the candles. They can use up the oxygen faster than you think.
105zlvx,,j3g2ivx,ooh how did i not think of that, kind of feel dumb.
105zlvx,,j3x3frz,Cars aren't air tight
105zlvx,,j3ya9lc,No. But if oxygen is used up faster than it cycles in, then you've got a problem. And a lot of guides about car survival will have warnings about it. In really cold situations, people light more. And if you're doing it at night, falling asleep feels very normal. You're hardly guaranteed to die. But it's dangerous, so I said to be careful.

105zlvx,j3f7c6f,,Make covers for your windows out of wool blanket glued to cardboard glued to reflectix.      Put darker fabric on it also facing outside to make it hard to tell the windows are even covered, at night just looks like it's super dark inside.
105zlvx,,j3fmolx,Ooh that‚Äôs a great tip thank you!
105zlvx,j3fskfc,,Ok so I‚Äôve seen this work with bathroom mirrors and condensation so maybe it‚Äôll work here (Note, I‚Äôve never tried this but it could be worth a shot) you rub shaving cream (not the gel the white stuff) on it until you can‚Äôt see it anymore and it shouldn‚Äôt fog up.
105zlvx,j3gsdxi,,A friend of mine swore by taping newspapers in the windows at night and then removing them in the mornings. Maybe they helped absorb the moisture and were easy to remove and replace each day? Not sure how well it worked, but worth a try‚Ä¶
105zlvx,j3hc5ej,,I've done it... Crack your windowess than a centimeter and also you can put some baseline like substance on the inside of your from windscreen to prevent condensation gathering.. Yes it's a pain in the ass to clean but it should work also avoid drinking hot stuff inside when it's cold outside.... Avoid parking close to lakes or forest were there's a lot of humidity... That's all I can think off.  Secure your doors by passing through door handle your seat belt to prevent force entry.  Stay safe

105wy4x,j3dax6a,,This is my most common meal. For those who are able/have access. I highly recommend cereal and powdered milk. Here is how I handle it.  I make my patented Hot Bran Porridge  1. Hot water: I get it from the gas station. I have a small flask that I use. 2. Bowl: Try your best to get a bowl you can use. I use one bowl to eat everything. It's best to use a bowl if you have access to one. A cup works fine in a pinch. 3. Milk: Powdered milk is the way to go. It can be stored and eaten over a period of time. 4. Bran: Bran cereal has vitamins and minerals. It also tends to have less sugar than other cereals. I make sure my bran has no added sugar etc.  It makes for a nice hot porridge. Bran is sold for $2.40 at the supermarkets around me. The can of powdered milk is $5. I keep at least 3 servings stored in case I am in a rough stretch. For protein, I buy a boiled egg from 7-11/WaWa. This allows me to have my daily micro and macro nutrients in one meal.   Those of you who know me are aware that I unfortunately cannot go out during the day time due to my disfigurement. So I get all the resources in the night time. If you're not disfigured or dealing with a physical issue. If you can get $10. You are good to go.  Let me know what you folks think.
105wy4x,,j3ddamo,If you can find powdered whole milk, go for that instead! A lot of the nutrients in milk are fat soluble so nonfat milk doesn‚Äôt do nearly as much for you. Also, fats are super important
105wy4x,,j3dqax7,Solid advice, I did not think of that. In my next store run. I will seek out whole milk.   I think the Brand + whole milk combo is a winning formula. It has a lot of nutrients. The warm water simulates a hot meal. Especially for those of us dealing with cold weather.  Hope you've been well this winter. Yesterday was super cold in my area. It makes me so **mad** when I have to run the engine. It eats into my budget. But then again, summer is far worse. The vehicle becomes so stuffy it's like being in an oven lol.
105wy4x,,j3f1j9h,Are you familiar with the concept of a creating a micro climate? Think of a blanket fort inside your car to create a smaller volume of air that needs to be heated. When I sleep in my vehicle, it makes the difference on those tough nights.
105wy4x,,j3h5snw,I used to backpack (just section hikes) before I hurt my back, so I know a lot about maximizing nutrients, especially where you can‚Äôt really cook. Powdered whole milk is a little more expensive but a lot better for you. The only problem is that more places have the nonfat milk, but if you can make it to Walmart they should have it
105wy4x,,j3dzwzv,Thanks for this I will use this next time I shop, it's a very good idea.
105wy4x,,j3geaim,I think that is excellent meal to maintain. Do you stop by to see the single serving of egg? two boiled in one container those are helpful.
105wy4x,j3fhgc5,,When i was homeless i knew a guy who after a hard day of slagin H he'd buy a box of captain crunch and a 1 litre of milk and cut the box open like one of those little mini cereal boxes and he'd pour the all the milk in there and eat it beside the Mac's on Douglas St. he had a dog named Twotoes that was actually a wolf and it was fukkin huge!
105wy4x,j3dzty0,,Delicious.
105wy4x,,j3ebogl,It is. I like that I'm able to eat it warm. It also isn't too sweet. It's reasonably good.
105wy4x,,j3geg1j,Don't forget to add fruit or cocoa. At times I use dried cocoa chocolate over warm cereal. Grape nuts is another cereal to add too. Folate.
105wy4x,j3fy6gz,,Looks tasty.
105wy4x,j3elpj5,,Looks good! I wanna get some.
105wy4x,j3hapxc,,If it‚Äôs in your budget, spring for Nido powdered milk. It‚Äôs a whole fat milk and tastes like milk. It‚Äôs incredible! I can‚Äôt stand nonfat instant milk flavor, but Nido is so good.
105vq6i,j3d2mof,,That depends on where you‚Äôre located! Most parks in the US are closed sunset to sunrise Abe police can and will tell you to leave
105vq6i,,j3d2ubg,I know that they can make you leave, but can they arrest me?
105vq6i,,j3d49jy,Honestly, I don‚Äôt think they would. I‚Äôve had a couple run ins with park rangers and they just verified I wasn‚Äôt running from any warrants and told me I couldn‚Äôt stay there (I was in a tent)
105vq6i,j3fyeec,,Most parks have an 11 o'clock curfew that ive been to. I've been told to move along if I'm there overnight but never arrested. It could easily draw unwanted attention. To get around that what I've done in the past is get a night job with a park nearby and sleep in a Hammock (30 bucks at Walmart) with a book on my face during the day and work at night. Keep the rest of your stuff hidden away where nobody will see you get into it. Shower and shave at the closest truck stop regularly, it's usually around ten dollars for a private bathroom with all the hot water you could want. Some even have a tub option if you wanna soak your bones.
105vq6i,,j3fyk3i,I'd kill for a bath and some food tbh, I'm just not sure what places offer it
105vq6i,,j3g00ac,Any truck stop (not gas stations) especially chains will most of the time have showers. Just walk it and tell them you would like to purchase a shower. Once you've paid for the shower, they will give you a ticket with a number that tells you when it is ready.   It's usually around 12 to 15 dollars, the truck stop I worked at included soap, a towel, and a wash rag. You got a spacious warm private bathroom with a sink, shower, and toilet. I don't remember us timing anyone so you could shower and relax.   I don't remember if the one with the bathtub was extra or not, I doubt it was extra. We would clean and sanitize after every person as truckers expect them to be spotless for what they're paying (showers are free for truckers if they get a certain amount of diesel but still.)  The only bad thing about truck stop showering is sometimes they can be a royal pain in the ass to get to and from one with how they're usually on a highway. Though they often need help and you could probably get a job at one and shower at the next closest one and they're usually relatively close to one another.  You could try googling *truck stop shower nearby* and call them and ask if they have showers at the location before making the trip out there. Maybe there is one closer than you realized.    Best luck I hope you find a clean warm tub waiting for you.
105vq6i,,j3g068h,Thank you so much!!
105vq6i,j3d2l2p,,You would have to check your local laws.
105vq6i,j3dgh2x,,Yes

105vq6i,,j3gs8li,Also I might add the conditions of shelters and temporary housing assistance programs are deplorable at best. Cold, cramped, way to many people stealing from each other and fighting. It's better to be off in the woods alone than surrounded by all of that mess. Oh, what a world we live in.
105vq6i,,j3kggo3,Its terrible that there is no land for homeless people.  Theres nowhere to go.  It truly is a horrible planet
105vq6i,,j3kgst1,Yep
105vq6i,,j3gs3v7,They don't. It went into affect this new year so cops will round up the homeless, arrest them, and send them to jail. After that you can get a voucher for housing at a shelter or some place close to it but that takes months. It's a system designed to fail. I was homeless for 3 years. It gets so cold out here and Kansas City is not exactly the most friendly place. Best places to go are the woods now. Under bridges and public parks are now heavily patrolled. Tax dollars hard at work. It literally makes me sick to think about it. What about you? Do you live in US?
105vq6i,,j3gsjyg,I'm out in Washington state
105vq6i,,j3gsm3z,What's it like out there give me the full details
105vq6i,,j3gst9b,Mostly camps out here. I've been couch hopping and havnt been out much except to apply for jobs. Other than that I'm not sure. I was on the street the other night and saw a few homeless people. I'm pretty scared, I'm a woman and I've had a lot of creepy men approach me
105skk8,j3ctl7h,,Police for sure.
105skk8,j3dcqzu,,Both are frightening for me.   Police: I do everything in my power to avoid the interacting with the police. I keep myself out of trouble. I've seen them harass and arrest homeless people who were causing no trouble. Unfortunately there are some police that get pleasure out of picking on the homeless.   People: They scare me because I have intense PTSD and depression. People are very cruel to me in the real world. So through personal experience, I do my best to avoid any contact with people in real life.
105skk8,j3cvo44,,The police. You can defend yourself or try to get away from other people. You are not allowed to defend yourself against the police.
105skk8,j3fwc3j,,Random people when catching me off guard. I'm usually too out of the way for cops to give me issues. Most people never know I'm homeless unless they find my camp or I tell them. I put a lot of effort into keeping myself very clean, never flying a sign, and only dumpster-dive after dark. I generally aim for college towns so I can blend in with the majority of people walking around with backpacks.   I'm a large guy (200+ lbs) with an athletic build often asked if I'm currently or recently in the military as I shave my head to make staying clean easier. I tend to wear military-style boots as they seem to hold up longer and be cheaper though they aren't very comfortable. People tend to forget I exist after I tell them I have no affiliation with the military.   Cops only spoke to me or remotely focused on me if I mistakenly set up camp someplace someone noticed and called in for a wellness check.   Any random people I run into are either hikers or people out of their minds due to drugs but both are usually quelled with an offering of food and a seat by my campfire.   I've had a couple random people try to raid my camp while I was sleeping but I was able to run them off easy enough then I moved my spot elsewhere as I want to feel safe where I sleep so I can get good sleep.  Best way I've found to feel safe is to set up camp hidden away and never tell anyone no matter how much I like them where it is. If you find it, it'll be gone within the week.
105skk8,,j3kfeen,Could you give advice on what kind of camps to set up.. How do you stay out of view?  What about wild animals.  Not sure where you are exactly and what environment.. If i ever find myself homeless and need to find a place to sleep i wouldn't know where to lay my head.  I would like to know in case i ever go homeless on how i should survive?  Would you happen to know any good resources or information?  thanks
105skk8,,j3kt3ta,Your phone or local library is your greatest resource in finding out wildlife in the area, and checking out sky view maps to find odd out of the way places that are far enough people won't be bothered with you, stores that could be resources for dumpster diving if it becomes necessary, truck stops so you can bath regularly, food banks, shelters (if you wanna take that option, I don't recommend it.),  and soup kitchens. I most often use Google maps. Learn to check out areas you will be going to or learn about the area you live in. Where the crime is, what places are active at certain times but completely desolate at other times.   No matter where you live there are predators.  In the city you can be beaten by teenagers while you try to sleep, police will interrupt your sleep, people will steal, rape, beat, and so much more to you sometimes out of their feeling of desperation, and sometimes it may be for sick kicks.   In the outskirts of a city or town depending o ln the place you have different risks. In Arizona scorpions and snakes are everywhere and you risk never having enough water for example. Some places have hogs that can rip you to shreds with their tusks, other places have mountain lions, panthers, alligators.  Then you have weather to prepare for. If you live in a place that is always cold then you constantly need to eat to give your body the calories needed to keep generating body heat, if you live someplace hot you have to constantly drink liquids water and other drinks as water alone won't be enough to keep your body cool.   As for camps to set up it depends on where you are and the conditions. There are countless variables.    I recommend keeping a pack no more than 20 percent of your body weight. It should have most everything you'd need to survive.    ‚Ä¢ have a dependable knife. ‚Ä¢ three ways to make fire.  ‚Ä¢ have a cover. Portable shelter like a tent, tarp.  ‚Ä¢ a single walled steel container, you can't boil water in a double wall.  ‚Ä¢ some type of rope, aka cordage.   I never set up camp within 100 yards of anything. As beyond that nobody seems to care. With a proper prepping you can have a fire at that distance within issue.   I tell everyone to avoid places that are congested like Cali, new york, or Chicago.  Resources are thin and it is alot harder to get back on your feet.   I recommend if you need money  badly go to a temp agency and keep yourself off the street before you're in that bind.
105skk8,,j3uherj,You forgot bears, and they are assholes!
105skk8,,j3uj9og,I didn't forget anything I just didn't mention the plethora of threats one can face.   Am I supposed to name everything from Africanized bees to komodo dragons?  BTW bleach in a spray bottle is said to be a good deterrent for bears as they are attracted to the smell of food and trash. Keep no food or trash in camp to avoid most animals and spray outside of coolers with bleach, sprinkle red pepper flakes around important camp areas it keeps most things at bay from my experience.   In areas with lots of raccoons I regularly spread red pepper flakes around my sleeping area and my gear to keep bugs and raccoons away from things.
105skk8,j3choer,,Most police.
105skk8,j3cwxnd,,Well, dealing with other people is much more likely to be positive. Maybe you're joking around on the subway. Maybe you're buying a bagel and receiving a compliment about your new hair color. Even in negative situations, you can at least book it or defend yourself. Dealing with a cop is much more likely to be immediately combative, escalatory, and dehumanizing. Oh, and they have a gun which they're usually resting their hand on, and with which they could totally shoot you any time they want, and they likely won't face any real consequences for doing so.   So, yeah. I'll let you decide, OP.
105skk8,,j3cyht0,Aren't there criminals or mafia people coming to beat the homeless?
105skk8,,j3dkuy6,Yes, every day. They beat up & to a pulp, steal from, torture, rape, and murder homeless people around & across the U$$A. They rarely even get reported let alone caught, and there's virtually no hope of getting them charged or convicted for their human rights violations because they travel in groups for deniability and iron-clad alibis. They're members of the largest, most powerful organized crime syndicate to ever exist in human history. They're the police.  Not only do they see the homeless population as perfect victims as has been the case since forever by those who wield State power & violence against the most vulnerable citizens of the State, but they believe the homeless are--by some divine lack of virtue & humanity--absolutely deserving of the abuse and violence. They attack "just cuz" and justify it with ["Just World" fallacy.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis) or Christian Karma as I call it.
105skk8,,j3dld2l,Most time criminals don't pick on homeless not worth it. Broke and nothing to gain from the. However I've still been mugged as homeless by fake ass "gangsters" most watch our for older teens who think they're gangster when they're not.
105skk8,,j3fxpyg,Agreed, entitled teens think it's cool to pick on people down on their luck.   What they don't realize is if they make someone scared for their life they will do things most people they've come into contact with would never do, or think of doing.
105skk8,,j3gdtrp,Facts
105skk8,,j3hwnp6,This is true in Utah, also. There was a group of teenagers a few years ago who would come to the neighborhood where the main shelter was in Salt Lake City, looking to beat someone up or even urinate on someone who was passed out.  When I was a case manage there, there was also a police officer on that beat who went out of his way to pick on homeless people.
105skk8,,j3cznmv,I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to with that last part.   But yes, of course there are criminals. I'm talking about the probability of an interaction to go south. The vast majority of people go about their daily lives having exclusively neutral and/or positive interactions with everyone around them. If, for some reason, you become involved with a cop, they are trained to escalate. Most of the time, you can expect them to talk to you like you're an idiot or like you're definitely doing something wrong. They clearly *love* the power they have over people. If they do decide to arrest you, they're most likely going to use excessive force, such as 5 cops tackling and laying on top of one guy, tasing someone that's sitting in a car and not a threat to the officer whatsoever, etc. Basically, you can safely expect any interaction with a cop to be tense and at risk of ruining your life at any moment, especially if you're black.
105skk8,,j3d0ws0,I meant, what happens more often? Encountering a criminal or a cop?
105skk8,,j3d1lw6,I'm not sure there's any data on that, but encountering a criminal is much less common than the news or internet would have you believe, at least relative to population density. Cops are everywhere, and their job is to look for something to confront people about. I'll put it this way, I've received something like 3 or 4 tickets in my life, and I've been arrested 3 times. I'm 30. I've never encountered a criminal that I was aware of. Anecdotal, I know, but again, it's not likely that statistics exist on this topic.
105skk8,,j3e1s5r,In a technical sense you **are** a criminal. I‚Äôm not trying to say you are a bad person or anything, I‚Äôm just making a point. I‚Äôm assuming you were ticketed/arrested for crimes, making you a criminal. I‚Äôm a criminal too (though mostly reformed since I‚Äôm no longer trespassing on a daily basis).  I don‚Äôt know why, but it bothers me when a term like ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù is used as a stand in for bad or dangerous person. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve known a **lot** of criminals, none of which were bad people and very few of which were dangerous (and even then, only situationally).
105skk8,,j3e5hyy,I get what you're saying. But in the context of the question, that kinda works in favor of my point. Technically, we come into contact with criminals many times throughout our day, and usually, nothing happens.   I don't even think you were trying to argue that point, it's just something that came to mind when reading your comment
105skk8,j3f7kx6,,Police, they'll hunt you like dogs
105skk8,j3ekvp4,,both but probably police a little more. but actually i don‚Äôt know.  i got robbed at gunpoint when i was 19, and the police almost arrested me because the man who robbed me lied and said i shot his car, i guess he had preexisting bullet holes in his car. i didn‚Äôt even have a gun. police never did nothing to the guy yet scolded tf out of me.   also got randomly assaulted at pizza hut while i had my two year old son with me. cops never responded to the call and the manager just stood and watched.   car got stolen at a gas station and the police refused to put out a BOLO for my car because they said it was my fault for leaving it unlocked. luckily i was able to track my dashcams gps and my dad and I tracked them down and got it back‚Ä¶ everything inside stolen though.   got arrested for sleeping in my car two times now as well.  so idk i continue to have terrible experiences with both people and police so i can‚Äôt decide. but the police definitely ruined my fucking life and they will continue to have that power and i‚Äôll always be terrified of them
105skk8,j3dh9ka,,People are more of a problem than the cops to me anyway. There are definitely some belligerent and mentally ill people in our midst. I have a clean background, so the worst thing with the cops is they just tell me to move along and that is pretty rare
105skk8,,j49ahcx,That's how it should be
105skk8,j3ek10j,,Dangerous Meth heads.
105skk8,,j3f0bd9,A meth head at least acts predictably.  A cop with a weapon? Does not.
105skk8,,j3fx7p4,I disagree, I've had methheads come into my camp in little more than a speedo when it was 16 degrees out because they just came down from their high and found themselves way out in the woods, I offered them some hot food (potatoes) and a spot to warm up by the fire and they were friendly enough. They hung out off and on for a week til I moved my camp because I don't like anyone knowing where I sleep outside.   Another time I tried to treat a methhead like a human being and they tried to rob me at knifepoint I had to pull a Dundee maneuver with my 15-inch kukri and he luckily wasn't desperate enough to want to take it any further and left me in peace.   I know everyone's experiences are different but I've only met a couple shitty power-hungry cops in all my travels. Generally, so long as I answered their questions and moved along they've been nice enough to even buy me breakfast once. Though I am aware of the problems with police and fully agree they need more training in other areas besides firearm training.

105gq6h,j3bb8yf,,I was kicked out by family when I was 11 years old on a snowy night. I didn‚Äôt have money and only had half bottle of water. I was walking in the snow for hours and then fell asleep on the bench at a bus station because I was hungry and exhausted. When I woke up, a stranger gave me some food. I kept walking towards the seaside, hoping to end my life there. I got distracted by a noodle soup restaurant - they were smoking some pork, which smelled very tempting. I walked into the restaurant begging for food, and the owner gave me some. I asked him to work there in exchange for food and a place to sleep, and he agreed. I chopped garlics gingers and onions, scraped grease from pots and stoves, and wiped toilets and floor. After four days, someone called the social service as I stink and looked like shit. Family picked me up and took me home, and almost beat me to death.   So yeah, I would say family owned restaurants may be able to offer some help. But this was my experience in a different country but I hope it also works well in the US. Best of luck!
105gq6h,,j3bdm56,Thats terrible that you went through all of that!. I hope you are ok now (?). Yes, it's amazing how various restaurants are so willing to help people by feeding them or helping them out in other ways.
105gq6h,j3bk9h0,,Terrifying and I didn‚Äôt even have time to adjust. My fianc√© was killed in the military.. long story short, lost my job right after that happened (unrelated, just really awful timing ) so I couldn‚Äôt afford bills, rent, etc with the life we built and he never changed his will, VA documents, and anything else so everything went to his ex-wife who lived across the country. I wasn‚Äôt even aware that the car we both shared was under his and his ex-wife‚Äôs name.. I thought it was just under his. So they ended up taking that too. Everything went up in flames fast. I ended up on the street, which was an extremely dangerous city where I lived, ended up getting abducted and sold into sex trafficking for about 2 years until I was able to escape (longer story there). I started to build my life back up and after several years the pandemic hit and I lost my job at the beginning of it. Now it just seems to be s never ending cycle of trying to get a job and keep it because of the layoffs wherever I go. I am now laid off once again at the new job and rent has increased. I‚Äôve already got my eviction notice and my car was repo‚Äôd awhile ago. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I am having major PTSD over being homeless again because of what I went through and it feels like history is repeating itself . I‚Äôm honestly considering ending my life at this point. I can‚Äôt deal with this. And I‚Äôm terrified. I don‚Äôt know how you all do it.
105gq6h,,j3bzus7,Might want to look into coolworks.com. And rattle.com is paying $200 for poetry chapbook reviews if they accept yours, so you can check out fairly recent poetry books in libraries and review them.  Also, if you live in a cold and snowy city,  I would recommend investing in a bike with snow wheels.
105gq6h,,j3c0ewn,Thank you so much! I will look into anything and everything at this point with any suggestions people have. I stay up for days just applying to places until I can no longer keep going and crash for a few hours.

105gq6h,j3fhg21,,My family has been poor since 2001 when my parents divorced and my mom was not working. My grandparents always put pressure on me to go to college but I never got a cent from anyone for help. I worked my way through school and took student loans out‚Ä¶ honestly big waste of time and money‚Ä¶ I mean I love being educated but I only make a little over minimum wage‚Ä¶ I would have been better off if I had done a 2 year certificate in a trade‚Ä¶ I got married and my partner said we would never have to worry about money but boy was I naive to just take him in his word on that.

My father in law abandoned my partner when he was young so I think he has no qualms taking the inheritance. Either my partner has no balls and won‚Äôt talk to a lawyer or he was never a trust fund kid to begin with‚Ä¶ not sure but I know my partner didn‚Äôt expect to become a truck driver after graduating from college in applied math. We had no options‚Ä¶ he was working for post office and the government shut down and we fell behind on bills despite that he was working‚Ä¶our land lord decided to be heartless and evict us instead of understanding.

Should have kept my mouth shut. I didn‚Äôt expect HR to call me and fire me the next day, I asked why and they told me I wasn‚Äôt within my 90 days of this new job so they don‚Äôt need to give me a reason. I cried and begged to keep it and they said I could apply again in the future but I could tell she was just saying that to get off the phone. I didn‚Äôt deserve to be fired, I was the victim‚Ä¶wtf‚Ä¶ I tried calling a few lawyers along with applying to other jobs but I didn‚Äôt bounce back fast enough‚Ä¶ had to live in my friend‚Äôs car‚Ä¶ and I was lucky to have that but damn, it just wasn‚Äôt fair. I am now working again but living in a more expensive city so‚Ä¶. living in a motel 6 with 2 people and all my $ goes to staying afloat. I honestly wish I could just die/ disappear. I never got into drugs or crime, and I don‚Äôt judge people who do but my family didn‚Äôt help me when I needed them most. It‚Äôs such a lonely feeling‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt see a future in which im not struggling, I don‚Äôt see a future where im surrounded by loved ones, I don‚Äôt see a career that is fulfilling.

105f8db,j3aw4rb,,Here is helpful information about how the federal government defines homelessness: [Definitions of Homelessness](https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/article/definitions-of-homelessness)
105f8db,j3c3280,,Yes. As a student who has done this process, a thousand percent yes. Please get your financial aid.
105f8db,,j3ywxw0,Do you have any resources that you know of to help prove that I am homeless? I heard something about doing an interview with the financial aid people at the school.

105ecsd,j3aetjk,,What kind of items are you putting together and what kind of shelter are you building? I've always wanted to make my own shelter and be self sufficient while having a job.
105ecsd,,j3ag0ac,Thankfully I will have a fridge and full kitchen at work.  I will be on the river, and found a great spot above the water line, with a natural wind break. I'm building a lean to shelter. Already built up a solid structure, and only going to use recycled items nearby to reinforce, or leaves to cut the rain.  I found a discarded sail I'm going to use for the roof waterproofing.  Will add photos shortly.  tent, hatchet, twine/string, shovel, saw, sleeping bag, portable cooker, gas cans, tarps x4,pillow, chair, new shoes, rain jacket,working pants, socks x3, external battery x2  Some items I have, some I'm going to buy.  Current build out comes to $950  I already have work clothes set.  My main concern is having stuff stolen during the day
105ecsd,,j3agc18,Yeah I've definitely had my whole tent lifted while I was at work one day. I'd been staying there for like 2 months at the time. Luckily, there was almost nothing in there. But I did leave a guitar in there before that, and it did get taken. Didn't want it sitting in my car all day in the heat.
105ecsd,,j3agsfa,Worrisome.  I'm planning to keep some items separate from the tent/shelter. And carry anything important, laptops, and documents.  It's an area where I can easily camouflage a few bag or clothes/tools.
105ecsd,,j3ah39e,Yeah, if you've got a whole setup with a lean-to and what not, you'll probably be fine. It's not going to be obvious when you're there or not. Like you said, just try to take the most important/expensive stuff with you. It'll always bea little nerve racking, but at the end of the day, it's just stuff, right?  Except the documents, of course.
105ecsd,,j3ahbdh,Hopefully no asshole comes and knocks it down. It can take the wind and rain lol.  Thanks for your input
105ecsd,,j3ahiov,For sure! That time in my life was probably the happiest I've ever been, just throwing that out there. I was right by a river, too, and I would bathe in it sometimes. When I didn't feel like it, I'd go to a truck stop and pay 6 dollars for a shower. Might be some useful info for ya, too.
105ecsd,,j3aq71v,If your shelter is well camouflaged, out of the way from foot traffic and in an area not commonly used for camping then you should be fine. My partner and I had a tent in a deeply wooded area of a local city park, we were there for at least 3-4 months and our camp was never disturbed. We even went back a couple months after we left to retrieve some items and the tent was still there. Still, you are wise to keep your valuables with you at work. (We both had jobs as well and I kept our documents and other important things in my work locker.)

105ecsd,,j3aoay1,It was pretty fun talking my lunch break to go and build it out.  I can definitely see myself adding to it in phases. I just get caught up wanting to make it perfect
105ecsd,,j3gds5o,I have done what you're doing now. A couple of pointers, if you don't mind. Perhaps they're redundant, but I'll throw them out there, in case something can help. Always have at least two sources of light. You can get a decent flashlight from Walmart for 99 cents. Always,always,always have some fresh water. You cannot have too many socks. Never, ever set your campsite near the road. Move back into the woods a good ways to a fairly isolated spot. This will help protect you from both thieves and cops. Make sure to note landmarks, so you can find your way back to your camp. (This is Critical!) Never leave anything in your camp that you can't afford to lose. Pack out all electronics, all documentation, and a change of clothes every single time you leave. Go to the local Social Services, or apply on line for EBT/SNAP benefits. This will guarantee a food supply regardless of actual money. Don't trash your campsite. Haul out your garbage each day when you head out. This may sound vanilla, but trashy disgusting littered sites do a lot to foster prejudice against the homeless. Be the exception, not the stereotype.  In wintertime, (like, now) set up your sleeping bag so it is above the ground. This can be done with bowers, an air mattress, (pain in the ass. You need a pump to inflate it. But, still worth it.) or pallets (the most efficient and economic.) The winter ground will suck the heat out of you faster than anything but freezing water. Avoid direct contact if possible. Keep enough money saved to replace your tent, sleeping bags, and some clothes in case you get robbed. As you wander, always scope out alternate places to set up camp. Take the time when you can to explore them. Keep a mental list of places you could relocate to if needed. Trust your instincts. If things seem off somehow, if people are getting too close to your camp, or if things nearby are getting hairy, don't hesitate to move. We have a natural territoriality that you must resist. You have no territory. The world is your home. You must camp where the tranquility is, and avoid conflict. Move when necessary, and do  not delay. Your life does actually depend on it.  Don't tell anyone you're homeless. Other than social workers. Homelessness instantly changes the way people view you. And not in good way. Is it fair, or just? No. But it is the reality of your situation, and you must accept it, or suffer.  Did I mention fresh water? And socks? Anyway, I hope this didn't seem preachy or pedantic. Just trying to help. Good luck to you. I hope everything works out well in the end. Feel free to pm me if needed.
105ecsd,j3c5wcp,,I live in my car by choice, I have the VA that will give me housing within 30-45 days. I just want to take full advantage of this situation and continue living in my car for at least another year

105ecsd,j3gaie9,,I keep a backpack primed and ready after I aged out of foster care and had to figure out on my own how to make it.   I spent my 20s traveling the USA as a nomad. It was terrifyingly enlightening, and then I learned what tools make life simpler.   Anymore I work off and on as necessary only to pay for the luxuries i want. I spent so much time outside it's like a second home. Being homeless is more an inconvenience than a terrifying situation anymore. Working hard doesn't get you again anymore sadly.   In the right places, you can live pretty comfortably outdoors once you get used to not having all the luxury of constant electricity, running water, and a toilet.   I recommend scouting out a few places no less than 100 yards from anything else. Keep an eye out for branches that could fall on you. If there is any trash or anything it's a no go. People go there.   Get you a Silcock key, it will give you access to water spigots on the outside of businesses so you can rinse off and get hose-quality water to fill your water bottle. Make sure to relock and tightly shut back off so you're not drawing unnecessary attention.    3 or more ways to make fire. BIC lighter, tiki torch, denatured alcohol, practice how to make a Dakota fire hole, fire starters, matches, fatwood. when it gets down to deadly Temps your fingers don't work right and the fire seems to refuse to take on a life of it's own.   Clear plastic drop cloth works better to cover a shelter better than a tarp it keep water from dripping thru. Emergency blanket-styled sleeping bag. 3 feet or more of leaves is needed for insulation.  I prefer to make a primitive shelter and then dig a fox hold under it with a pocket in a corners filled with small rocks for any water that runs in to collect. It takes time but tossing rocks on fhe bottom keeps things cleaner as you don't have to worry about mud so much. The dirt I get from the hole goes on top mixed with leaves to add insulation and make it look like a rough hill. I've carved a bench/chair and a mini fireplace.  Hygiene is a huge deal, it can cost you your job and your life. Keep a gallon jug of water for washing off. A cheap bar of laundry soap is useful for keeping clothes clean in a stream so you don't have to lug clothes to the laundry mat and spend money there. Clean boxers and socks shouldn't be a luxury. Wash your hands and face every chance you get. It's surprising how quickly dirt can collect and make you look dirty. Baby wipes are wonderful for this.   Dumpster diving is a way to get meat in colder months.   You can bury a ice chest so when the lid is placed the chest is just below flush with the ground with dirt on top. Fill with ice regularly and you can keep some food and not have to live on less desirable food.   With some rope and a bag you can fill it and submerge it 3 feet or more into a a body of water and it will keep meat and milk good for days. Cereal is something I enjoy sometimes and where there's a will there's a way.   I know loads of tricks to make living outside very comfortable if anyone has specific questions feel free to ask.   Temp agencies are a life saver as well. They can offer day labor without the sketchiness. So you can make some cash.   I will say don't get busted digging on, or sleep in a hole on someone else's land. It will get you arrested. It's just how I was able to make it places that got minus double digits in the winter and moderately high crime rates.

10596bv,,j3ax5au,heya. i'm sorry you're going through this shit rn.  For the address: In my experience, some shelters will offer to take your mail so you can go pick it up there. When i was homeless and looking for jobs, I used either the shelter's address on my resume or an old address if i was worried they'd look up the address and see that it was a shelter. i've never had any prospective employer mail me anything but, well. if i were you, i would call around to some places in your area to see if they offer the mail thing if that's what you need it for.  As for the safe place to sleep: that's really dependent on your area and i'm hesitant to tell you exactly where to go. i would start out by calling shelters right when they open and asking if they have spaces. you could knock out seeing if they do mail, too. there is [211.org](https://211.org) for seeing what's around you. i always got really frustrated trying to navigate the front page for some reason, so you might be better off just googling "211 homeless resources". it's true that not all shelters are created alike, but it could be worth a shot, at least just to see what's around you and what you've got to work with.  During the day i hung out in either the library at the community college or in panera with their ultimate sip club thing. gave me space to think, which was what i really needed.  some of these places will also help you get hooked up with things like a social security card, medicaid, food stamps, etc if you need any of that. i guess i'm mostly just passing the advice i was given to you... I know there aren't really any "good" options here, but i'm glad you're trying to survive this.
10596bv,,j3axnm8,Thank you!! Yes, I've been homeless for 7 months trying to figure things out, I'm handling it better day by day. My biggest concern is my safety. I'm planning on applying for food stamps soon, and I'm meeting with an organization that helps out homeless youth. So I'm making some sort of plan.
10596bv,,j3dc816,Hey sorry I thought my message went through this morning. My phone is only wifi based so it lags at some places, do it never got sent.  Look up homeless shelters in your area, especially near mid to large city's. Generally the further in the city the better the services, but they're more full and filled with threats of theft and possible bullshit with others, But staying to you're self and standing up straight while being quiet does a good job at stopping people from fucking with you.  Lots of homeless service places will help you get an address to receive mail
10596bv,,j3dkvzw,Ah, ok, thank you!
10596bv,j3bqpps,,You said you been homeless 7 months? Have you been on the streets before? Or slept on peoples couches? Sleeping outside sounds super scary when you havent done it, and it feels strange and scary the first nights but eventually you gain skills and get used to that life. Staying with people who only took you in because they didnt want to see you on the street can be draining.  I stayed six months of the two years i was homeless with a friend and he eventually threw me out on the street again despite saying he would not ever do that.. If I become homeless again id actually prefer living on the street than a shady charity sofa by a friend who will get tired of me and throw me  out. It gets better. r/homelesssurvival take a look on it.
10596bv,,j3brami,Yeah, thats what happened here. Saying "I'll never kick you out, we dont want to see you on the streets." To saying the exact oppisite out of the blue. They have their own traumas that they are projecting onto me. I've set up an appointment with a youth organization that says they can help with some stuff(not housing). So, I am getting somewhere. I've couch hopped, been in shelters, and been on the street to. The youth organization wants me to stick it out through the weekend, but the people I'm staying with sent some text messages, and long story short it's unfortunately escalating day by day. I'm planning on leaving in the morning before they are awake in order to avoid arguments, and hopefully get into some sort of shelter. It's saturday where I'm at, so I'm not sure. I'm just happy that I am at least getting somewhere, but i have quite a bit of stuff i need to get changed, like the mailing address for my insurance and all that. I don't want these people holding my mail hostage, as I believe that they may already be doing.  It's nerve wracking, but one step at a time.
10596bv,,j3bru23,Idk where you live if it works, but I could change my mail to the shelter adress, maybe look into that option you? Hopefully you can get shelter place soon ‚ù§Ô∏è
10596bv,,j3brwkr,Would I be able to do that if I didnt want to stay in the actual shelter?
10596bv,,j3bs1am,I dont know. I dont know how it works where you are. I didnt have shelter place at the shelter my friend and I got food from but we could put our names there.
10596bv,,j3bs85t,Yeah, it probably just depends on the place. Any tips for how to find somewhere to sleep outside? I'm a bit afraid of getting a ticket or ending up getting hurt in a shady area
10596bv,,j3bufg3,It really depends, do you have a tent?  Me, I could sleep in a night open train station and a Burger King, also night buses and metro when it opened at 4 ( but that was not legal traveling cuz had no money)
10596bv,,j3bulng,No, I don't have a tent, and the restaurants here boot you out if you don't have any money
10596bv,,j3bunez,I'm not sure what kinds of places would be open at night
10596bv,,j3bv0hz,Can you get a sleeping bag somewhere? Here organisations handed them out Helped when it was cold   Or just stay up at night and sleep in a library sofa in day?  Did that some times too
10596bv,,j3bv4fi,I was given a lost of resources that were clothing, I think that maybe they might have sleeping bags
1050vit,j3c1dtz,,That's why people in my city can't get workers. Especially for minimum wage jobs.  Because even if they did overtime, it can't pay the rent prices in this area. So, there's just no point. When they can go somewhere else that's cheaper.
1050vit,,j3rhtyo,Go somewhere cheaper and the pay goes down too. We are in a very large cage, there is no escape.
1050vit,j3bj1re,,people make so much other shit up to explain why people are living on the streets, it's annoying  say what it is... why does everyone want to protect residential  price gouging?  the bs everywhere is unnerving
1050vit,j39vgcf,,Couldn't find a place within a specific budget, ended up homeless and draining emergency savings that would have lasted me a year if I had housing- even expensive housing. The income:rent ratio required left me with nowhere to go.
1050vit,,j3altim,By the week or month motels don't ask about your income
1050vit,,j3asi5u,They are exorbitantly expensive, 500/week. It's complicated anyways and it's really hard on me to rehash everything to explain
1050vit,,j3dnqz5,Depends. There is one near me that's not a dangerous place that lists $70 per night $420 per week and $1600 per month. However the monthly minimum rate is actually only $1100 per month and the desk clerk gets 50% commission on anything over the $1100 so $1500 gets the desk clerk a $200 bonus every month they stay. I met one person their that was actually getting charged $1700 a month. I couldn't believe it.  If you find motels that are independently owned and also take cash without credit card security and they will flex on the price... Especially for cash because they can leave the room listed as empty and pocket the money all tax free. Small bodega and corner stores also tend to change different prices depending on what you look like, if you look poor or not and most importantly if they think you will just pay a higher amount without question or realizing it. This is a major reason why many of these stores don't list prices.
1050vit,,j3dputa,That's not tenable for me
1050vit,,j3fhzmk,Exactly. Well stated. Any time, effort put towards this option needs to be weighed against its worth‚Ä¶security, terms and limits, location, health and transportation etc.  Dang, just the monthly rate alone locks you in to never getting out.  Now‚Ä¶I could perhaps see it, if one was retired, on SSI, Medicare and such and figured that it was this option or an assisted living for $3-5k a mth.  Heck, I‚Äôve even heard it‚Äôs cheaper to just take cruise after cruise vs a retirement home‚Ä¶I‚Äôve spent enough time inside of assisted living and nursing homes‚Ä¶horrible experiences.
1050vit,,j3fyznf,It's like a never-ending chess game in my head
1050vit,,j3g3py1,Yeah it is ain‚Äôt it?. Always in a stale mate‚Ä¶you put forth the time, energy, thinking, strategy‚Ä¶make the move‚Ä¶end up stalled again‚Ä¶near the same dang position you were in to begin with!  If you‚Äôre lucky, I suppose.  Lots of traps‚Ä¶be careful! I‚Äôm trying to think through the muck I‚Äôve just landed in.
1050vit,,j3rge1k,Maybe not for you specifically but I figured it could be helpful to others. $1100 a month with every utility included is Fantastic where I'm at even for a rental so that motel is great. My point was that you can get motels down to the same price as an apartment without background checks or income verification just look for places that always have vacancies.  You can also split a motel room with somebody else and not worry about getting stuck like a regular roommate agreement that involves a lease.                    Good luck wherever you are, you may need to consider moving. Do you have a regular income?
1050vit,,j3rluc4,It would be 2000 a month, and I'm not in a place where 'always have vacancies' is the norm nor am I actually capable of working right now, I have extremely disabling PTSD from quite recent trauma. Thanks though.
1050vit,j39sxoz,,Not just that, the rising cost of everything. Literally can only get 50 to 60% of the groceries today that you could get just a couple years ago for the same money...
1050vit,,j3kv9h7,All because of Greed. Lost my wife to cancer so there went her disability too. I can barely make it paying rent, utilities and food. Just basics. I really don't need two bedrooms. I sleep with the dog on the couch in livingroom with the TV on.
1050vit,,j3lj9n2,Sorry for your loss. Rent in my area is almost double what it was 2yrs ago, we are seeing two and three families going in together on rentals. That is if the landlord will let them.
1050vit,,j3rhi4l,I needed to buy a tool and was short literally $5 the week before Christmas and figured Id grab it after as my sister usually gives me a gift card on top of some other stuff. I went to order it Jan 2nd and and the price went up by $20 so basically in the time it took to come up with the $5 it went up by $20 more.                 Inflation is bad but its not just the inflation.. Businesses are using the inflation as cover and jacking up prices for profit. Corporate profits are continually rising and stock market is doing well yet inflation is bad and people are struggling... Its greed by corporations and the super wealthy followed by many smaller businesses doing the same.
1050vit,j3aqcg5,,People that have permanent supportive housing can't even find housing because rent has surely the maximum limits for most programs.
1050vit,j3bzu12,,I don't know, did they consider that we are all just a bunch of drug addicted hobos? /s   For real, I feel like this is something we already knew.
1050vit,j3aey13,,Yep‚Ä¶luckily when I was younger, rent was more affordable. Now, there‚Äôs absolutely no way and I hear some places are down right disgusting.  Some places I rented were, a couple even had mold issues, but at the time they were affordable.   Affordable housing is a serious issue in America.  It‚Äôs hit my area especially hard and yet for some reason the Senate (and other) elections for a particular candidate in my area‚Ä¶the campaign workers were not only misinformed about Homelessness being related to (quoting the Volunteer that spoke out) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly drugs and mental illness.‚Äù, but when confronted with evidence collected from many various organizations in my area, this campaign volunteer denied it.   Then made the accusation that I was arguing.  Some people don‚Äôt realize that they live in a bubble.  Some of us come to realize that, others not only live in a bubble up so high above, but also that we have various degrees of bubbles (especially in America) that we live in.  Edit: Thankfully the candidate (who was also backed by the local police fraternity) lost to someone who will hopefully be more compassionate.
1050vit,,j3ato4r,Arguing for the truth. What a terrible thing
1050vit,,j3c7qjo,Ain‚Äôt that something?.  Wished I would‚Äôve recorded the phone call I had received at a later time, before elections.  The framing of the questions. I was ready. It took about 25 minutes for the party member to say, ‚Äú‚Ä¶l‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôve got other calls I need to get to.‚Äù  Needless to say my experience in my area was this‚Ä¶the campaign made a claim about Homelessness.  When asked about this claim‚Ä¶there was nothing that was provided to back it up. Nor a plan on even how to deal said claim.  I was, of course, then asked to provide what I knew‚Ä¶(funny since I wasn‚Äôt the one making the claim), but I did anyway cause I knew a thing or two.  Keeping notes of helpful organizations and people who help run and lead them in my area for those in need‚Ä¶well, I had plenty of a response and yet the campaign worker on the other end of the line was clueless.
1050vit,,j3rijqu,Bubbles. Fucking bubbles. They were great as a child.  Like you said, some people don't realize they live in a bubble. If someone doesn't have some type of bubble(s) they live in they need glasses. Everyone has bubbles.
1050vit,j3c3x8a,,I don't wish homelessness on anyone but when I see full of themselves people who look down on us become like us, I do think they had it coming.
1050vit,j39t2u6,,No shit.  People have been saying this for years now.
1050vit,,j3bdne2,Maybe if we keep saying it eventually people will get it and we‚Äôll get affordable housing? Hasn‚Äôt been working so far‚Ä¶ but like, what else can we do? I‚Äôve been doing everything I can to avoid paying rent so I can save for my own house. Or rv. Or whatever. A lot of people are following my lead, the news says we have more people living with their parents longer than ever.  If I ever get on my feet, I‚Äôll be doing everything I can to make sure others can do the same. If enough of us can stop rewarding the landlords for their awful behavior, maybe they‚Äôll finally cut the bullshit.
1050vit,,j3co11e,It's not that people don't get it, IMHO its that most people don't think it will ever happen to them, so they have no real incentive to get involved or even care.
1050vit,,j3fjc89,The machinery of the system(s) keep everyone busy too and one can be fairly resilient, but family might not be.  So there‚Äôs that factor too right‚Ä¶some keep busy attempting to keep family from falling too far down.  There‚Äôs just so many traps.  It truly is easier to just not care.
1050vit,,j3kw11f,Exactly. Just one small emergency or a 100.00 monthly rent increase would put me out in the street.  I had to actually beg someone to carry me to the store to buy food for the month.  What bothers me I have a grandkid who always job hops, keeps the roads hot and complains he hasn't got any money. He better wise up to keep a job and start trying to save some money.
1050vit,,j3omk89,If you're willing to move to Arkansas, I can show you half a dozen houses for under $1000.00.  **If I ever get on my feet, I‚Äôll be doing everything I can to make sure others can do the same**  Me too.  Just got on my feet and bought my first house for $800.00.  I'll show u if u want.
1050vit,,j4ka0sj,No shit? I have a friend that just moved out of the Little Rock/Fayetteville area. I‚Äôm currently still bouncing between friends and making money all over the place, but when that slows down I‚Äôll be interested. I‚Äôve been saving and preparing for what I‚Äôm gonna do when I can‚Äôt couch surf anymore.   That‚Äôs really cool! Thanks for sharing/offering to share! I love hearing about stuff like this and would love to learn more.
1050vit,,j3bj7v9,no they fucking haven't... they been saying other bullshit
1050vit,,j3cnw92,Then you haven't been paying attention.
1050vit,,j3aka49,[deleted]
1050vit,,j3atr03,You offer nothing of value to this conversation.
1050vit,j399z2a,,Rising rent has not helped but how about all the homeless 5 years ago? Some are still homeless/ Drugs are a major issue....I am guessing 50%ormore of homeless are junkies.
1050vit,,j3alcrq,50% of the visible homeless are strung out on drugs 100% of the time, but the other 50% aren't - that 50% uses reddit
1050vit,,j39stbp,50% are employed
1050vit,,j3alh6i,Employed as what? Dealers?
1050vit,,j3ao3fv,Part-time, unable to afford housing? Food service, Gig workers, I've sold phones to homeless Uber drivers. . . Actually, now that you mention it, one dude I used to live near tried flipping an 1/8th from a dispensary to me for a hit or 2. It also happened to be in front of my therapist, which was kinda weird. Anyways, I don't talk to them anymore. . . Kinda stay away from that part of town. Some people live in cars. . . Etc. I've also worked with homeless construction workers.
1050vit,,j3c9hf6,gig driving sucks most of the time. If you have a job where you are homeless time to find another one Uber and Lyft have cut the drivers pay so much its not even worth doing with gas and car expense. There was a huge local discussion on this. Uber and Lyft are now taking at least 50% of the fare leaving the driver with 50% or even less. What a joke. There are other jobs out there. You are better off getting a fast food job $15/hr and sleeping in your car  then driving for UBER. Also zero benefits. Get a retail job with benefits or somrthing else.
1050vit,,j39t6fe,Most homeless people don't have an addiction or mental health issue.
1050vit,,j3alerj,They cannot be a remotely factual statement
1050vit,j398mxx,,Seems like drugs are the problem to me.   This became a huge issue way before the rent recently skyrocketed.   If we can't even be honest about the issue, how are we ever going to solve it?
1050vit,,j39q74b,Every single expert on housing snd homelessness disagrees with you, and since they‚Äôre the ones who do the research, maybe they‚Äôre not the ones being ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù about the issue.
1050vit,,j3fkfgk,Most recent report in my area on Homelessness is in agreement with your statement here.  I have both spoken with the admin running a local shelter (social worker of course) and read through the latest report (December 2022, which was put together by all the larger shelters and organizations collecting data and providing resources in my area.)
1050vit,,j3bocpn,Try thinking for yourself for once instead of using appeal to authority logical fallacies.   If cost of housing was the issue, why would all the homeless migrate to the highest cost of housing in the world?   Why would the homeless population explode before the housing prices exploded?  If they aren't working, why does it matter how much housing went up? They can't afford affordable housing if they have no income...  As the housing prices spiked, why didn't the homeless population also spike instead of continuing steadily?  And no you're wrong, not every single expert disagrees with me. Every single made up liberal expert who benefits from exacerbating the problem disagrees with me.   Have you been to these tent cities? Half of them are so high on drugs they aren't even coherent, how are they going to pay even a reasonable amount of rent?
1050vit,,j3ccaw6,Dummy, ‚Äúthe homeless‚Äù don‚Äôt migrate to the areas with the highest cost of living, homelessness is highest there bc cost of living is highest. I can‚Äôt believe I have to explain this to you.  And just because you believe something doesn‚Äôt make it true. Homelessness has directly correlated with housing and rental prices for decades. Rental prices have outpaced wages exponentially since the 1960s. That gap has skyrocketed in the last decade. Not yo mention most people experiencing homelessness do work at least part time.  And not to justify anything you say about drug addiction, but addiction is often a byproduct of homelessness, not the other way around. Turns out living on the street fucking sucks.   But I‚Äôm wasting my breath, since you clearly know so much. Please, cite me all of your academic work on homelessness and poverty.  Oh, wait, you‚Äôre just another jackass.
1050vit,,j3dvns4,You have no idea what you're talking about, obviously.  Newsom Invites Nation‚Äôs Homeless to Move to California [https://headlineusa.com/newsom-invite-homeless-california/](https://headlineusa.com/newsom-invite-homeless-california/)  If they're all from the highest cost of living area in the world and just suddenly can't afford $3,000/m for rent, why not take a short bus ride for $30, and cut your rent down to $1200?  Here's a chart on the national rent[https://imgur.com/a/OPdXuUV](https://imgur.com/a/xL60aon)  Here's the homless population[https://imgur.com/a/KSbZ7Ol](https://imgur.com/a/KSbZ7Ol)  If they're so closely correlated, why does the chart not reflect this at all?  So if someone can't afford a house, they can afford drugs? Got it. If they can afford to maintain an expensive drug habit, why can't they just move to a lower cost of living area and no longer be homeless?     The experts disagree with your feelings.  "Kelly Cunningham, San Diego Institute for Economic ResearchStudies on homeless populations show approximately two-thirds cite alcohol and/or other drugs as a major, and at times primary, reason for becoming homeless."  "Chris Van Gorder, Scripps HealthMental illness and drug/alcohol abuse are much more significant issues than have been recognized and responded to."  "Lynn Reaser, Point Loma Nazarene University  Although about a quarter of those interviewed reported housing costs as a reason for their homelessness, more than forty percent cited problems from substance abuse."
1050vit,,j3fnlre,I haven‚Äôt drank alcohol in like three plus years, but put me on the streets and I probably wouldn‚Äôt last a week before deciding why not?.  I‚Äôm just speculating of course from the last experience I had of sleeping in a vehicle.  Anyhow, I see you asked some questions‚Ä¶were they rhetorical?   The one about purchasing drugs over buying a house‚Ä¶you do realize just how different those two things are right?  I honestly didn‚Äôt know how difficult it was going to be for me to purchase a home‚Ä¶I failed many times. Not enough job history, not enough credit history,  Then got those fixed, but‚Ä¶was blown off for being part time, went to another lender, but that lender wanted almost twice the down payment (which I didn‚Äôt have), Went to yet another lender which then approved the down payment, but flagged the condo complex on a rent-To-own ratio, but offered to loan me nearly twice the amount for a single family dwelling, which I likely couldn‚Äôt afford‚Ä¶since I had already tried that a couple years before.  Ended up not getting that condo, which would‚Äôve been under $300 a month mortgage at the time compared to my $500 plus month rent, which then jumped to $645 before moving out.  Did I mention how much nicer and larger the condo was compared to that basement apartment?.  Just my experience though.  I think drugs are likely much easier to purchase though I never have.
1050vit,,j3fpye3,You don't have to buy a house, most people rent.     FHA loans are really easy to get for first time home buyers though.     My point is if someone was paying rent in San Francisco 5 years ago for $2400/m, and rent went up to $3k/m and they could no longer afford it and they became homeless, they could easily move only a hour or two away and have much more affordable housing than they had 5 years ago. That was the debate, whether the cause of homelessness is mainly the price of housing going up. It doesn't hold up to basic logic in my opinion.      And if they're getting high all day every day like I've seen, what does that add up to in a month? $400? I've seen housing only an hour or two from SF CA for only $1200 a month, split that with 2 other roommates and you have a house if you didn't do drugs all day.
1050vit,,j3g1s7c,These added details do help to clarify the point you were intending to make, which previously left me quite confused.  Personally‚Ä¶I feel you‚Äôre making wayyy too many assumptions and should review your statements.  To clarify my situation‚Ä¶at the time I was looking to purchase the condo I was nearing the end of my lease at the apartments right next door‚Ä¶as my rent was going up about another $140 a month.  FHA, VA, conventional loans denied me for Condo‚Ä¶Based on minimum loan amount requirements at the time (they wanted me to Buy More, but also the FHA and VA would not approve due to The Rent-vs-Own ratio (those that rented units vs those that owned and lived in their units‚Ä¶needed to be above 50/50.)  To dive deeper‚Ä¶just when I moved into that particular apartment I had been renting and had worked at my job for seven years (part time, no full time option, but exceptional benefits and was able to go to college full time and had just finished up my guard duty like the year before)  I ended up getting a foot surgery prior to moving in, which put me out, then tried returning back to my  job in the warehouse‚Ä¶No Go! Couldn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶had to do more therapy and unfortunately because I had Returned to work (my insurance said I obviously wasn‚Äôt disabled) so I had to take all that time off on my dime, which set me back.  (While this was occurring, my doctor at the time didn‚Äôt hesitate to offer pain meds, which I declined (I was majoring in health and my father struggled with addiction issues, this doctor I later replaced due to his overprescribing of meds.)  I knew I needed to workout the issues with physical therapy.  Jobwise‚Ä¶I knew I needed to switch it up in the warehouse, so I did.  In the meantime, I decided to start making money on my blood plasma since I had already been donating it for free.   I got into it from being a whole blood donor at a young at of 18.  You see, I could‚Äôve easily fell into homelessness at this point in my life and or had to again, put my college on hold.   I was just more fortunate than others.  Thankfully, I managed to get caught back up.   Again, I think you‚Äôre simply not aware of the bias you hold and assumptions you‚Äôre making.  You are, in fact, cherry picking information to fit your beliefs.  Go speak with the admins at your local shelters and ask for yourself. But you won‚Äôt.
1050vit,,j3ga438,I don't see how your personal information is relevant to the conversation.     I don't see how purchasing a house/condo is relevant either.     If you're homeless you don't get a mortgage, you take baby steps and get an apartment, any sort of roof over your head.     I'm not cherry picking anything, it's basic logic. You haven't shown how anything I've said is false, and neither has anyone else. You're just parroting what you've seen other people say in response with no logic or reason to it whatsoever.
1050vit,,j3ge0f6,It reveals how narrow minded you are.   You‚Äôre simply assuming that just like that‚Ä¶housing is easily obtainable.  Definitely not always the case.  You need to consider the individual factors.  You brought in your local area factors‚Ä¶I brought mine.  Deal with it.  Edit: Of course I went much deeper and didn‚Äôt make quite the assumptions you made about homelessness.  You still aren‚Äôt going to speak with any shelter admin are you?
1050vit,,j3huu93,Short bus ride for $30 and how do they continue getting to there old job when the moved a $30 ride away.                   I believe you mentioned moving a couple hours away for cheaper rent in another comment of yours here. How does someone afford to move a couple hours away if they are already struggling to pay the rent? How about if they use public transportation? How do they get to their job a couple hours away every dah?
1050vit,,j3i05v5,You‚Äôre making too many solid points for someone with poor foresight into such matters.  The person you‚Äôre responding to, and others likewise minded, do not care about what‚Äôs actually true nor are able to show intelligence in empathy (an understanding if you will) of others situations.  The only view that is seen, is a single personal view reflecting their worldview‚Ä¶hence the short sidedness.  The person you‚Äôre replying to will not seek out, as I suggested, someone specialized (educated with a master‚Äôs degree, at least and trained), which has spent years working in the field to become an admin who‚Äôs function in the community is to tackle the topic of discussion‚Ä¶this person won‚Äôt do this because it‚Äôs simply easier for them not to.   It‚Äôs simpler to stick with the bias at hand, not change thinking even when presented facts and a trove of evidence‚Ä¶no this person finds comfort in continuing to double down and be apathetic to human beings because it‚Äôs more comforting to do so.

1050vit,,j3j65zx,Empathy lmao, right. The guy actually trying to identify the problem is the one lacking empathy.  You stupid fucks are exactly why the problem is getting worse every year. Keep up with your empathy while people suffer and die in the streets rather than actually trying to help them.     It's not the rent going up, dumbass. It's the drugs, obviously. Have you ever even seen these tent camps? They're open air drug markets.
1050vit,,j3ro1ok,Those are not all of the homeless population.                Many people who spend a significant amount of time homeless will experience significant trauma and develop PTSD. People will treat that problem with drugs, usually alcohol first, especially if they don't have a support network.                  Please answer me two question:              First question:  Do you think everyone that works should earn a living wage or to phrase from the other side should businesses be required to pay their employees enough hourly to be able to support themselves?                  Second question: Should healthcare be private and for profit?               I ask those because those are significant factors.

1050vit,,j3rjvf9,Maybe drugs are specifically the problem for you but they are not the sole prolem or even the main problem. Drug use is a symptom of other problems all of which compound and lead to poverty and crime. Many studies/programs have shown if you give people housing first that not only will you get more people housed you will get more people housed AND more people sober and they will stay housed and sober. Outcome across the board is better with Housing First and that includes saving money.

104z4co,j38z1w8,,If you have Medicaid, and you are getting the surgery ordered as medically necessary, then talk to your doctor. They will put you in touch with a social worker. If you are in the hospital right now, and can't talk to your doctor, talk to the hospital doctor assigned to you. Request talking to a patient advocate and/or social worker. All hospitals are supposed to have at least one or the other, they could be the same person as well.  The social worker/advocate can go over your options with you. Being as how you can't be SAFELY discharged to your car, and you have nowhere else to go, they will locate somewhere to place you while recovering. They can't discharge you to unsafe conditions, which includes living in a car. They should find you a nursing home or something, or, if they can't, they will keep you in the hospital until you can be safely discharged. Also, if YOU don't feel like you can be safely discharged, talk to medicaid (should be a contact number on your card), and/or the patient advocate. You may be able to stay until a third party can review your status. It's a right that medicare patients have, I think it applies to medicaid patients as well.
104z4co,j39hzwh,,Talk to the hospital social worker. You need a discharge plan

But I recently got a job and I don‚Äôt want to get surgery and lose my job. My surgery is a major one I need my brain shunt replaced. So I‚Äôd rather work as much as I can and get back into stable housing. Save enough money to get me through surgery and recuperated. I will already have to go to a skilled nursing home after surgery no matter if I‚Äôm homeless or not.
104z4co,j37um74,,Call 2-1-1 they should put you in assisted living for a while or a rehab.
104z4co,j39rd6a,,Get the surgery, your health is first. Rest there, get stronger there. Hydrate after your allowed, rebuild your body. I have viewed as hospitals as good places to stay no matter reasons. Health is first.   hospital will send a case mger as 48 hours post op. They will help you with placement into a small rehabilitation center after recovery in the hospital. Skilled care will help too.   Gees I wish u well.

104z4co,j39w2mh,,There should be a shelter in the surrounding area that offers recuperative care.  Many of these facilities require a discharge nurse or Dr. To refer you to the program. I have recommended it to a few of my clients.
104z4co,j3bp63i,,I've had a couple of surgeries while homeless, and while it definitely isn't fun, there are options out there for you.  Like other folks have said, you're gonna wanna ask the hospital you'd be having surgery at to talk with a social worker or patient advocate, in order to formulate a discharge plan that will ensure you're going to be able to take care of yourself afterwards, and get to any follow-up appointments.   I will say this though - when I see people sat that they've been told they need back surgery, I always suggest that they get a second opinion, and avoid any surgical centers that are run by your doctor for procedures like this, or places like the incredibly shady spinal surgery centers that used to have commercials all over advertising their "free" MRI reviews. The vast majority of the procedures pushed by places like that? Are completely unnecessary, with incredibly low rates of success, and if you'd like some brand new nightmare fuel to keep you up at night? Check out failed back surgery syndrome.   I'd also be making real sure that everything will actually be covered. Just because you have Medicaid? Doesn't mean it will be, and you're gonna want to confirm that with that actual billing department of where you'd be having this procedure. Anyone else? Isn't qualified to tell you what is and what is not covered, nor whether you'd have co-pays, or other limitations on care.  ***I'll add that any reputable doctor who was trying to schedule a much-needed back surgery for a homeless patient would be working with you to help make sure you have a discharge plan afterwards that includes a place to recover and the ability to get back and forth to follow-up appointments. If they don't make an effort to try and help you out with that? Then they're not really concerned with your health and well-being, so much as they are with scheduling a procedure they can profit off of, and therefore not the doctor for you.
104z4co,,j3cq4ih,Honestly, the surgeon is great, and is making 100% sure I need this surgery. I have a herniated disk and really bad sciatica, and they‚Äôve tried all the nonsurgical options already, but I‚Äôm disabled from this right now. The only reason they haven‚Äôt done surgery by now is just that the odds of success for this surgery aren‚Äôt great
104z4co,j3ax63a,,i work at a shelter - the local hospital tried to discharge everyone to us.  push to be discharged to a facility if they even bring up the possibility of that not happening.
104z4co,j39rw81,,Ask for extra time, medicaid will probably do that. Rehab floor, meaning a recovery floor of physical therapy and case mgmt. Skilled care.  Do the surgery you'll be ok. Bolster nutrition the best you can.

104z4co,j3bwpc4,,I used to work in an rehab/nursing home. We got a lot of people who didn‚Äôt have support for recovery at home including those that were homeless and then they worked with our social worker for what to do once they were recovered enough to leave.
104z4co,j3jthft,,you will be discharged to a skilled nursing facility and stay there while you heal and participate in physical therapy, a lot of times the social workers will work with you with discharge plans, known some that were able to get into assisted living or other arrangements, prayers.

104z4co,,j3ahxz7,Back surgery isn't given out like candy. You really have to have a serious issue for most surgeries, much less back surgery. People would much prefer to go to a chiropractor and get their backs straightened out that way. You DO realize that back surgery is major surgery. You are dealing with the spine, the MAJOR highway that your body uses to communicate with most of your body. One wrong move in surgery CAN and HAS resulted in temporary or permanent paralysis. Or so much damage that the body can't even tell itself to breathe properly. Were you aware of that?

104napd,,j3b2gt6,You need a non blacklisted address. Shelter/Churchv addresses are not allowed. Also a recent lease/utility bill. Its so you don't spend the platelet/plasma money on drugs/liquor, or towards a desultory lifestyle. It's going to people that need the blood/plasma, so they want serious/responsibile donors only. Also, you can't give them reason to believe you're homeless. (Tattered clothes, backpacks, unkempt appearance etc.) Also many of the donating centers are in the middle of nowhere on purpose, to deter vagabonds.
104napd,,j3clbet,The utilities isn‚Äôt necessary where I am.  I didn‚Äôt know about the blacklisted address.
104napd,,j3e0aaq,I'm in the Los Angeles area. All the ones here, I think on purpose are located in the boonies. So good luck as a person on the street, finding a way to venture there. Not only that, if you're a first time donor, you go through a physical and mental screening process, and right here if they feel you're doing this as a desperate measure for cash, security is gonna escort you out of the facility. Supposing you happen to not give them any reason you're homeless, you're hustling them etc., you have to give proof of residency, which can be either your apartment lease/utility bills. Also, if the address you have is of a homeless shelter, church, or if it's an address that's commonly used by people they had doubts about etc. it's blacklisted, and again you will be asked to leave, and will not be allowed to give plasma.  I kinda might get downvoted, but I kinda understand where you're coming from. The whole point of those places, is for healthy people, with free time, to give blood/plasma to those that need it. Those in major car accidents, people who need blood transfusions for whatever illness/treatment they are dealing with. It's not for people living on the street to spend the money on liquor, and drugs etc. So although it's not 100 percent foolproof, having people verify they aren't living on the street, is a good step and measure at least.  Sadly people are fucking stupid, and we live in a society (I should know because I'm Black and Gay) to where one bad apple spoils the whole entire bunch. The good eggs are punished, sadly by default.

1047d5h,j346ckc,,I'm an introvert who has learned to act like an extrovert sometimes but panhandling I was just never able to bring myself to do it. It just felt so wrong for me. So I just found other ways to make a little money while homeless.  I would offer to help clean up at pizza shops for pizza slices or make earrings to sell off a blanket. A couple of times I made some art prints and sold those in the parks because it's allowed here sans permit, unlike jewelry which sold in the wrong place could get me busted.  I also flipped a few things I found thrifting online once I was in a shelter and had an address. I even tried to do one of those tee platform stores, Red Bubble. I made a few bucks that way but never that much. By and large though I found if I was offering something tangible some people would buy it and help me out and I could avoid panhandling entirely.  I came out of a background in retail management and sales. So selling to me came a lot easier than just asking people for money. I actually don't like direct sales very much even if I am good at it and I'm a crafty type so I mostly just made stuff and put it out there and dickered if need be.  Just sitting on a tourist pier or on a blanket in a major park making crafty things usually had people coming over to see what I was doing out of sheer curiosity. Most days I'd sell enough for quick dinner at least.  If people offered me money I took it and thanked them but I never actually went over to them and solicited it. It was just too uncomfortable for me.

1040ecn,,j350u3s,You are not a freak.   You are not a loser.   You should not feel ashamed.   You have value.   Homelessness often relegates people to the corners of society, where their desperate circumstances cause people to treat them like (and often tell them that they are) worthless.   You are NOT worthless, and **you deserve food and shelter, period.**  Doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, what you‚Äôve done, or what mistakes you‚Äôve made. You. Don‚Äôt. Deserve. Homelessness.   I hope any number of the resources above can provide you with the assistance you need. I am available if you want to talk or need advice on budgeting / negotiating your way back out of homelessness.   Like I said, I can‚Äôt give you money, and I have nowhere for you to stay myself, but I will help you in any other way I can think of.   If you‚Äôre moving into your car I have advice there too. I really hope you don‚Äôt do that, though.   One day at a time, and stay safe.

1040ecn,j33dkbx,,Okay don't know your full situation as to why you're homeless so I will give you advice as if it was my situation. (Family kicked me out due to drugs, kept asking for money from family and friends so the only place I had to go to was a shelter) with my experience in hand. I would say just go to s shelter at night since you have a car UNLESS you prefer the car. If I had a car I would just stay in my car tbh because you never know the type of people in a shelter. Most of them try to help other homeless people but it's always the thought of other people's motives and if they are sick and you don't want that trust me. If you do have enough money for a couple blankets and pillows, buy them. The shelter I went to just provided sheets and a cot to sleep on so it was very cold snd uncomfortable (except in the summer months it was so hot I couldnt get comfortable worth shit.) Don't know how tall you sre or if you have one of those backseats that fold down into the trunk bjt if you do then Boom you got yourself a bed right there. Just park somewhere nobody will bother you or police will bother you and you got it made bud. Just make sure in your free time you're doing something productive, trying to find a job, doing a job, shit even door dash. Just something to where you are just on your ass all day. You got it, trust me. May take some time, may feel like giving up sometimes, but you gotta remember who you are. Gotta remember that everybody has the same 24 hours in life, just gotta use it wisely my friend.
1040ecn,,j34y546,Im extremely hesitant about shelters, im severely depressed (ik im so unfortunate and unique), i hope this motivation can help me get out of my self pity and social anxiety, thanks man.
1040ecn,,j4xvclz,No problem. When it comes to the shelter part I kinda actually lucked out. I have wounds from a space heater blowing up on me (was too high that night so I slept thru it and woke up with hella blisters) and once the blisters pop and scabbed over I kept picking at them (0/10 would not recommend). Anyway I say all of that to say this, since I have so many wounds I was able to be placed into a nursing facility/in patient physical therapy. So now I have somewhere to stay that isn't a homeless shelter. I don't recommend you hurting yourself to get wounds or something like that to be placed in a facility HOWEVER I am all for finessing the system. Gotta get it how you live ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1040ecn,j35p8mj,, Since you are in school, contact your advisor and see if housing is available. Since you are sleeping in your car, make sure you use the school gym or have a gym membership so you can shower when needed. Most schools have services available, so never be afraid to ask. I am in school myself, but I work full-time, and I'm old as dirt (48), and I'm married to a wonderful woman who has a job. I wish you the best of luck and keep up the good fight

1040ecn,,j34wxqt,Family has let me stay with them because of issues with my parents and since i was briefly homeless in another state. My aunt breaks and steals things, i admit i have been just as rude to them back. I feel they have been emotionally abusive but i didnt swallow my pride and have argued back
1040ecn,,j35znv5,Try to work it out, even if you have to do stuff that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Try to finish your CS degree, get a good job, get your own place and never forget the people that tried to bring you down.   But if you enter the cycle of homelessness, you‚Äôre unlikely to finish your degree. It‚Äôs hard enough under normal circumstances, but near impossible living out of your car, in shelters, etc.   CS major here too, didn‚Äôt finish, short of like 6 non-CS classes but have been working non-stop for the last 20 years. Good luck man.  Edit: the lack of degree has definitely slowed me down so finish that shit! I should‚Äôve gotten to where I am today 15 years ago.
1040ecn,j37zerm,,Which suburb ? It depends on where you live
1040ecn,j38dmsv,,I have been living in my car for about a year by choice. Just make sure you have income and are able to stay warm and have dry cloths and you will be ok. Always have a plan and work on it every day. And remember to take care of yourself mentally and physically. So take a break, eat healthy and ya know. Look for a good laundry mat and get a gym membership if you have income. Hotels are really expensive so only get one in a emergency. There are lots of van life and car life videos on YouTube that can give you some tips. But if your goal is to get a place I would focus on your credit score and save up money. Don't trust anyone you meet on the street. Even if they seems nice they may rob you of everything.

103pim5,j34p6s5,,If I‚Äôm understanding you correctly you are able to essentially visit friends and round robin . I in the past have left a containers/crates/backpacks at friends places, that way everywhere i stay has necessities clothes/hygiene/chargers. That way if friend A had something come up then its still ok.   I would recommend not taking tattered-clothes or stuff you dont wear (for whatever reason) that stuff takes up space and mental bandwidth.  Be practical but also don‚Äôt ignore sentimental items. Allow yourself to keep a few items that maybe mean something to you, having that stuff sometimes helps when things are difficult.  Depending on where you live there might be resources for homeless people.
103c8sv,j2ylux6,,Where do you live? Are you anywhere near a national park? If so, buy a cheap tent and find a good place to post up. The law is technically like 15 days is the limit, but A.) Rangers don't usually bother reinforcing it, and B.) If they do, the law says you can literally move your tent to a new spot and the 15 days starts over. But you won't have to. Just bring books or go use public wifi to download shows, because it will get boring. Get a portable charger for your phone, they're not that expensive. I bought a recurve bow and some arrows from a sporting goods store, and that kept me entertained for a while. There are some areas in national parks where camping isn't allowed, but they're limited. Just look up the back country camping/no back country camping sign and look for it. You can also just look up BLM (bureau of land management) land near you, as not all of them are national parks.   A lot of truck stops have showers, and the most I've ever paid for one was 15 bucks for like an hour. They usually provide soap, shampoo, and towels. If you don't have a job, get one as close to your campsite as possible so you don't spend too much on gas. I used to drive 45 miles one way from my campsite to work, and it was expensive. But, you won't be paying for rent or utilities, so your money will stack until you're comfortable getting a place.   If that route isn't an option for you, you'll want to look for 24 hour stores, neighborhoods where street parking is allowed (it'll be obvious), churches, and truck stops. Rest stops tend to have a two hour or so limit. Walmart either does or doesn't allow overnight parking, depending on the store. They almost always have signs up in the parking lot letting you know if it's not allowed, but if you aren't sure, just go in, say you're traveling, and ask if you're allowed to park over night. No harm in asking. Also, if you're parked somewhere you're not supposed to be, the worst that will happen is you'll get woken up by a cop tapping on your window, telling you to move. Don't go to the same place over and over again. If this is what you have to do, then use your days off to go out to a national park and camp there, if only to get a break from the city.   And finally, I just wanna say that I lived this way for about 8 months, split between two areas. I've also lived this way with a girlfriend who was down for it. Those were, by far, the happiest months of my life. I didn't rely on anyone, the only bills I had to worry about were my phone bill and gas for my car. I got to camp in some truly beautiful places, and bathe in beautiful (albeit very cold) rivers. It's gotten me out of some living situations that were making me miserable. I felt free, and I kinda wish I could do it now.  Anyway, good luck OP.
103c8sv,j2zexe5,,I may not have any advice directly for your situation but given that you are very young, there is something to consider.   While you are working, gain a skill or if you already have skills, work on improving those skills significantly.    The reason why I say this is because rent and inflation has been through the roof over the past two now going on three years.   That way when you get a place of your own, you would have skills or even certificates that will land you higher paying jobs, that will better support you.   Never put all of your eggs into one basket because the way things have been going, it should teach us that having more skills and specializations will significantly benefit you in the long-run. That way you will always have a leverage and never become a victim of the stratified systems that currently work against us.   Having a leverage and always thinking two steps ahead of the competition is how we will rise above these unbalanced systems that come against us.   Always be at peace!

But if you can lessen the impact you have on her and make it work, then do that as long as you can.  The reason I suggest this is that it is traumatic to sleep in your car. It is an added level of stress that can eventually become chronic stress. It can affect your health tremendously.  What is your Mom's attitude about you staying in the garage?

1039vcl,,j2yk7xt,They won't file the actual eviction with the court until you have violated a posted 3-day vacate notice.  This is good to know because usually a complex has to pay a fee to file an eviction (it's +/- $200 here in Utah). So you can extend this buffer period if you need to by telling them that you are working on getting rent from family, Etc.   An eviction on your record makes it difficult to rent in the future. If there is an option for not getting one, you should seek it out. Sometimes the process can be played a bit, because complexes often don't want to pay to evict you.

1036spc,,j2yy4w9,No, but beginning to build such a movement could help in the here and now. You start with a small mutual aid group, expand them through force multiplication (teaching people well enough that they can teach people well enough that they can teach people, using that to spawn new groups in new areas who keep in touch and work together), and over the course of years and decades that can escalate and grow until it can carry out a viable dual power strategy. But in the meantime, you are still helping people, challenging the system, and making changes by building an alternative. Yes, there's no way that we can snap our fingers and fix everything, which is complete bullshit and wrong for the people who are suffering and dying in the meantime. But there is no good reason that we couldn't start making a difference right now, if people would just make up their mind that they could make a difference right now and work together to do it.

We are fake, shallow, and narcissistic as a general reality taught in masses from the 90‚Äôs on when a few took over the modern world and grabbed a hold of our newest technology revolution in society.    Everything you think you know about politics is fake. A few changes can be made on a local level, but politician above local governments are ruled by money and the iron triangle which is lobbiest, votes, and money all tied together. I learned that in political science.    I have given up on our country and the world politically trying to turn my focus on things like modern human slavery as companies like Hersey‚Äòs openly knows child slave labor is heavy in chocolate.

Likely tons of other reasons to make such laws.

Some jails or prisons are indeed better than festering homeless encampments full of violent, often mentally ill, drugged up people preying on other homeless, physically assaulting, stealing belongings, and so on. Unfortunately the worst enemies of homeless people are more often than not other homeless people. I don't know where you are but I am in California, in The Bay Area, which is full of chronic homelessness, and see these things up front and close, first-hand.

Not to mention regurgitating the same ignorant shit that we always hear from people who are talking about a subject they have no experience or knowledge of.   You have no idea how difficult this situation is on a good day. I don't have any drug, alcohol, or mental problems and it's a real bitch both emotionally and physically. I can't imagine what it's like with those issues, which are what force most people into homeless.   So no, let them stay at your house is not the answer.

10345i3,,j39vgyz,My point was that if you‚Äôre complaining about this newly placed law then you should let people sleep in your house or in your yard that are homeless. So no you can‚Äôt sleep in my house. Also, I‚Äôm genuinely curious. Why can you not get a job?

How, exactly, should I go about this?
10345i3,,j3ft7lb,There‚Äôs a lot of places/people that would understand you have no place to put your belongings and would probably let you keep it on there property or in there car, like myself I have a small tree cutting business.

Furthermore, I see you‚Äôre in California and are probably near a city. if you can save up $150 you could start door dashing with a bicycle for probably around $200 a day before tax with the right work ethic. Also what does needing a place to sleep have to do with getting a job? You‚Äôre already homeless so does it really matter if you have a place to sleep or not? Just be honest with your self. You don‚Äôt want a job and you don‚Äôt mind the struggles of being homeless enough to go and find a steady income or an apartment and even to start a family. You‚Äôre just making excuses man.

Until you can figure some things out.    You could try maybe looking for a room to rent, if you're comfortable with that rather then an apartment. There might not be so much emphasis on the credit.    Contact local homeless services, your local DHS etc... see what assistance they offer. Even if you don't think you'll be eligible still try.

102jm3a,j2tte0q,,RVs aren't amazing on gas but would make living at campgrounds much more comfortable and house like, you can buy state park passes and stuff and that would basically be your only rent as long as the pass lasts, letting you camp pretty much anywhere for certain amounts of time. You can save alot of money that way, you just have to hop around whatever campsites are around forever which could get draining I'd imagine, but I rolled with some people doing that and you can literally run it all flying a sign for a few hours a day, so if you had a job you could stack cash pretty quick and maybe be able to just buy land or a house in the future. I'm planning on doing that myself and know some that are much farther along than me, I live in a minivan rn.  The bonus is also you can just travel literally anywhere and there's your house right along with you, state park pass, boom now you live there. Sleep at walmart for work in town, dissappear into the forest on the weekends. Figure out where has the lowest cost of living with the nicest environment and just go there, and work until you got a decent living situation like land or a house or something. The possibilities really open up when you get something like that cause you can shower and eat actual home cooked meals and shit in your own toilet, *stand up and walk*, lay down flat in a your own proper bed, watch tv, if you have a dog or cat it'll be extatic to just be in a house, so you end up feeling alot better about everything.

102jm3a,,j2wobih,A maintenence regimen is a good practice, frequently checking everything and getting the problem before its a real issue helps a bit. Parts for RVs can be pretty expensive depending on what you have, some rvs are built on popular vehicles, like the Ford and Chevrolet ones are just built on E-350 vans, so parts would be a little easier to come by. You gotta be selective with buying rvs, but if you get the right one from the right dude it'll last you quite awhile. Like try to find an old man who used it once or twice in the 90s and wants it out of his yard now or something, there's a few of those kinds of people around usually and they offer a shocking price for what it is sometimes. My homies almost got a legit, 100%, airstream from the 70s in near perfect condition, for less than 10 grand, those go for literally hundreds of thousands. My homies got fucked in the end cause he played takebacksies and gave it to his daughter, which kinda sucked.   Buying a truck and pulling a trailer is also a solution, or buying a truck and a camper that sits in the bed, the truck bed camper can be cramped at times but then you'd just have to worry about the truck going wrong and not just the whole house

102jm3a,,j2ugwpi,I'll check it out, thank you!
102jm3a,j2vuble,,It's very possible. I've done it many times over the last 15 years. I travel around nomadically every three months or so. I aged out of foster care and had no roots or anyone to turn to so I just started moving around. I figured out if you camp someplace far away from anyone else so you can get good rest so can hold a job. Go to a temp agency and tell them you'll take anything that ways well. It's never failed me in any city. I work for three months and spend the bare minimum strictly on food. It's kinda miserable but after three months of saving alone, I've gotten myself off the street many times and into a nice apartment.    Recently I was lucky enough to find two people who wanted a house so I asked if they wanted to split it three ways and get a house and just work as a team. It's been a year and a few months and it's working out great. We all make our own money and work as a village. We went in on a 2 bedroom house to rent. It's way cheaper and more spacious than an apartment.    We split all the bills, and share one vehicle carpooling to work different days. We share problems while being considerate to not make unnecessary problems. I cook most of the meals and grocery shop for the house from a list we make. We sit down and have a weekly dnd game at our 6-foot dining table, it's a fold-up plastic table but hell it's a clean table and I'm happy about having it.   My point is you can make it. Don't give up. Have a goal in mind and be flexible because it might change for the better. I was planning to be an island beach bum by now. I was gonna hitch a ride on a boat to Puerto Rico and figure it out from there. Fishing and relaxing in a Hammock.   The biggest thing to remember is this is part of your journey.  It may suck but the worse it seems now the more you'll be able to laugh at how crazy things were when you look back.   For example, I've had my hand shoved in a lawn mower, half my face burned off, lost my legs for a year after getting stuck under a semi (physical therapy is truly magic I'm telling you, i swear some of them are sadists tho), I've been stabbed 5 times, my head split open, and shoes melted so bad I had to cut them off my feet, fought off five junkies with a 15-inch kukri on the outskirts of a town by campfire light and lived to talk about it, hit by a truck on a gravel road and launched 15 feet into a ditch and woke up sometime later all gimpy. *AND I still don't qualify for disability.* lmfao   I'm hard-headed and used to be pretty reckless but some of us take a rough path while others can learn from their mistakes early on. I hope you learn faster than me.   Life can throw a lot at you but you can make it. Everyone has their shit they have to experience some more some less. Just know that if you want things to change they can just plan and stay flexible. Find that razor-edged balance between reckless and overly cautious. You have to take calculated risks to make changes.   No matter what happens every day find a little thing to make you smile. So long as you can take pleasure in the little things everything will work out in the end. Besides, it's about the journey and the memories you make on the way to your goal.

102jm3a,j2ujeve,,It's extremely difficult and I'd say damn near impossible for some people.  It all depends on the situation.  I know that if my mom didn't have a HCV then we would be completely fucked with no chance of ever affording a place.  When I was working full time in medical field I didn't even make enough to live on my own. I lived with my cousin/her bf  and we all split things 3 ways.  At one point me and cousin who both had full time jobs me in a doctor's office and her in medical billing were looking for a place for us and her daughter who was a baby at the time so we would have needed  a two bedroom.  We couldn't find anything that we could afford even searching in the worst places and that was about 5-6 years ago.     Things today are the worst I've ever seen. I barely made it out of homelessness my mom's HCV was going to expire Oct. 3rd. I found an apartment at the end of August. After 8 months of searching and 3 months of being homeless which lasted another month before we could move.  The price of rent is absolutely insane plus the extreme and ridiculous requirements like making 3x the amount of rent and near perfect credit scores.  The waiting lists for section 8 where I live is about 10 years. I really don't know how other low/no income people survive, it's usually by living with family members. For those who can afford rent, it's what most of their paycheck goes towards. That's why there are so many people with full time jobs who are still homeless.   For those that are homeless due to addiction/severe mental illness the support needed to help them needs to be comprehensive involving medical/psych treatment, financial assistance, living assistance depending on their condition.  Which just isn't there for them. Especially since most assistance denies anyone who has a drug addiction or criminal record. It's really bad out here for a lot of people and it's so easy for those who don't have to deal with it to just brush it off and separate themselves from it because it doesn't effect them or because they see the homeless as different then themselves.

We are of the very, very few that made it out. Even after two years of treatment, the majority ran right back out to get high and so many of the people we knew are dead that I‚Äôve lost count. No one can afford to financially support an active addict and if they don‚Äôt put the work in to get themselves together then there‚Äôs nothing you can do. It really does seem hopeless and insurmountable.
102jm3a,j2xtjjf,,You guys both need to work as much as possible and get as much money saved as you can. Keep bills to a minimum. Ditch expensive habits smoking and 420 will also impact any housing search. ...you might rehome the pet since you are homeless and you have a better chance of finding housing pet free. There are also fosters and non profits that might temp take in the pet.   Check craigslist or FB marketplace and see if anyone maybe has a casita..again the pet maybe a problem...hotels are way too expensive and are not sustainable so avou the hotel route they will just take your money
102jm3a,j2tknnd,,Keep working hard and you'll find your way back.  A van can be good because no rent but also can have its own problems because of parking, zoning, limited space and amenities, etc.  Rent is a treadmill that many never graduate from to home ownership.  The only way to get ahead in a capitalist society is to find ways to make your money work for you. When you do this, they're called assets and they tend to be protected from inflation, unlike wages.
102jm3a,,j2tt8sk,Thanks for the encouragement. I really appreciate it. It's hard being positive all the time.
102jm3a,,j2u64ub,I've been homeless. I had a lot of help getting back on my feet. I have reached out to others with mixed success. I wish you both the very best! If you were in Colorado I could provide more resources but I'm just one guy on Reddit.

102jm3a,,j2vfdjy,You can find seasonal jobs on coolworks.com and they usually provide housing and often meals.
102jm3a,j2uz6sa,,Check out the website affordablehousing.com. Apply for all the affordable housing you can. If you need help with the fees, move-in, & deposits, ask around to churches. Decide your own goals. If living room in an RV is really what you want, then do that. Living with other people is very difficult. I would rather be camping. I would speak with a financial counselor or social worker. Maybe someone can give you some suggestions. Some of the churches will help you with this. You can also apply at job training that provides housing. TeenChallenge and Delancey Street both offer job training and free housing.  There can be a lot of pressure to conform. You don‚Äôt need to be like everybody else. I don‚Äôt know if you or your fianc√© have done any time in jail (I hope not), but there are some ‚Äúreentry‚Äù programs that offer housing and job training.  I would also go to the unemployment office and ask them. Sometimes they have classes on how to do a job search. You can take a personality test to find out what kind of work you might like. There is an excellent book ‚ÄúWhat Color is Your Parachute‚Äù.  And the local library can be a resource. Librarians can help you with a bizillion things.  Check with your parks & rec department for free classes. There is a big demand for people to be electricians, stone masons, and other construction jobs. They will also offer training.  Let us know how you are doing. You won‚Äôt be homeless forever.

102jm3a,j2vg6y4,,A car or van can be very helpful by giving you some shelter, privacy, safety and the ability to move around. It comes with other problems but it‚Äôs often a good goal if you can afford it. Check out sites like cheaprvliving.com that show how to do it. Stay away from most of the vanlife videos where people spend thousands building the perfect setup and end up moving back in with their parents. If you look a little, there are plenty of people living in cars and vans and doing great.
102jm3a,j2whqaf,,As I write from time to time, homelessness is a complete breakdown of basic humanity, the entire system from your mother to the United Nations having failed you, and you failing the system. The older one gets the less likely to rebuild humanity, plain and simple. Not to mention the ongoing massacre of the middle class, which means that even if you rebuild some of the soft tissue of your life and somehow learn to live with your uncle or your friend or whatever, it will be a life of minimal space and poverty. Anyway, enough with the good news :)   Unless a miracle happens, most people that will come out of homelessness will do so with subsidised housing, with all the waiting, heartbreak and uncertainty that will bring. But I wanted to mention the elephant in the room, home ownership. For me and others who don't have severe mental or physical problems, our housing fate had something to do with little interest or investment in home ownership. Yeah, I know I sound like a madman, people don't have $1000 for the rent and I'm talking about hundreds of thousands, but it's home ownership that keeps billions from homelessness, and it is the closest to subsidised housing one can get just by saving money with a life partner and focusing on affordability and sustainability.  Sure, affordability is an issue in general terms, but not so much if you're going to fight for your modest home and mortgage tooth and nail.  I won't lie, once you've spent a month or two without paying rent the idea of tightening a $200K noose around your neck is very unappealing, but it's also part of rebuilding our humanity, having a couch or a garage for the next fellow human being in need, renting out a room when help with the mortgage is needed. Get hitched, get a mortgage, live grumpy ever after!
102jm3a,,j2yk4f3,It is true, if you can just save up the minimal amount needed for an FHA mortgage or first time home buyer program or something then homeownership is the best way to go.  I know that‚Äôs easier said then done, but for those that can, try to avoid renting.

102jm3a,j2w0wn1,,You can escape homelessness with dedication, self-discipline, and a little help from social service agencies, family, friends, and good luck. If you aren't completely mentally or physically ill or lost, you have a good chance. The permanent homeless seem to be those who gave up and accepted their lifestyle, chose it, or are too damaged or incapable of doing what is necessary to get out of their situation.
102jm3a,,j30lvsy,There is also the in between. Been unofficially homeless/couch surfing for two years. Been officially homeless for 10 months. SSI takes time to develop. Section 8, there is a waiting list. Welfare might be on hold if you have to recertify, or for whatever reason etc.. If you want to do something fun, you can't. You lose energy, and your soul and spirit is broken, to attend social events. You don't have the money either, and have to be at the shelter before 7 etc. You can't donate Plasma, if you don't have a lease/residency proof, and prove you're not a desultory person, you are sometimes banned from their facilities if you use a charity address. You feel you are out of options.  Then I feel, at 31 years of age, (I'll be 32 on the 16th lol) I made it this long, aside from ocassional cigarettes, and very light liquor use, I am drug, and ill gotten criminal activity free. But it's hard for people not to be tempted I guess. No money, no help, so they turn to drugs, and negativity, and toxicity. Which is not an excuse, don't get me wrong. But still.  I feel, I get what you're saying, but it came across like we aren't trying. My welfare was shut off until March,, unless I get my disability wavers signed, which is an adventure. I was not selected for a section 8 voucher. I'm waiting to hear back from social security, as I'm autistic. I'm Black and gay, with no money, and no boyfriend. (This is Robo/Jeremiah from the Discord server BTW lol).   But I'm trying. Nobody wants to help you, and judges you.
102jm3a,,j30mmsh,I understand it can be extremely difficult and hope you can get out of this situation asap. Don't give up as hard as it can get.
102jm3a,j2w3kd3,,Took me 2 weeks.  Luxury apartments here for $800, regular ones for $650, just checked. Get out of the cities, crime isn't even an issue in the cheap parts of town.  Everywhere is hiring. Factory jobs for $21+/hr, gas station jobs for $18, fast food for $15.
102jm3a,,j2w626k,Everywhere I live has gone up. My old 1 bedroom used to be about $800 and now it's over $1,300 in a shitty area. I live out in the country now, so I don't have a lot of options when it comes to apartments/houses. They're all expensive because the demand is high. I also have to be able to afford rent + the initial deposit and pet deposits, which are expensive. I definitely can't save up that much in 2 weeks, but I'm trying.
102jm3a,,j2yahqq,It's definitely gone up here too. Used to have a 3br house in town for $450.      I'm sure it will continue to go up too, but at least wages are also going up.       I couldn't have saved it up in 2 weeks by myself either, I found a roommate.
102jm3a,,j2x0v7r,Can I ask where you live?
102jm3a,j2x7nu5,,I've taken in a number of homeless people.   Several of whom have gone on to rent at other places.   So it's possible for some people.

102jm3a,j2u1wb2,,Put your pet up for adoption. I know a pet is like a family member but when we were renters only the rentals at the top of the price range would allow pets. Reality is a lot of pets cause damage to the property, not saying yours would, but it doesn‚Äôt make financial sense for the landlord for rentals with a lower profit that won‚Äôt compensate for the potential damage.
102jm3a,,j2uh86n,I already tried that when I was on the street and wanted better for them. Nobody was interested in taking my cat and all the shelters were full. I called over 50 shelters to see about them taking my dog, but they couldn't. I found someone who wanted to adopt my dog after about a month, but they ended up abusing him and calling me up one day to say, "I don't want him anymore. Come get him." He came back messed up, so now I don't want to consider that again. It just broke my heart.
102jm3a,,j2vihgw,Not sure about cats but there are rescues for dogs that find a good home and check up on the dog.
102jm3a,,j2w6q3s,I'm so sorry you are going through all this. I went into the shelter system and finally after 4 years got on boston housing. I got to keep my cat because I rented from a private landlord and even though it said no pets after she met my kids and I she changed her mind. I also got to keep my cat at the shelter because I was in a shelter apartment. I did have to give up my other cats but one was adopted right away the other 3 went into a rescue who had no actual shelter they just used foster homes. 2 were adopted together. While at the shelter I found a 6 month old kitten who i tried to hide but he walked out right in front of my case worker. I found him a home on this site.   https://rehome.adoptapet.com/   On adopt a pet you put in pictures and a bio about the animals and people who want to meet them email you. You pick out their family. Make sure to meet in a public place and have someone with you. I got my kitten adopted in 1 day. I miss him a lot.   If you are keeping them this organization in Nevada helps homeless people and their pets all over U.S. and parts of Canada. If you go on their website you can put in your city or zip code and you can find free pet food. They also have resources on their website. They also pay for crates and vet care but for those you have to call them. From Boston I would call my time 1-3pm EST  they are open M-F 9-3pm   here is the the site     http://petsofthehomeless.org/    Good luck I wish the best for you and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask or dm me.

102jm3a,j2tv9h1,,I don‚Äôt suggest saving up for a van because I have a feeling it‚Äôs goin to get tougher for people in cars, vans, and rv‚Äôs in the coming years. There‚Äôs a few reasons for this. The ruling people are trying to get people to drive much less and no longer be able to afford or own your own vehicle. They are making it hard and expensive to repair your vehicle. They will continue to increase cost of gas. U might have trouble finding parts for older cars on purpose. The only way to get out of this situation is through God. I mean it would help to find a church u can stand going to and start making connections there. The government won‚Äôt help u. You need people who are compassionate and genuinely can offer assistance. You also need to have faith that God will create opportunities that will help u get out of homelessness. U can‚Äôt let the seemingly impossible circumstances make u feel like it‚Äôs hopeless. God intended for him to be our sufficiency, not the state, other people, etc.
102jm3a,,j2vfqdv,Lol why hasn‚Äôt god helped up until now? Religion is just a way to distract us and keep us from improving ourselves. If god is going to help us, we don‚Äôt have to do the work ourselves. Well, there is no god so don‚Äôt wait around for things that won‚Äôt happen.

102ixu5,,j2tzav8,No. Also they usually deny your first application.   Unless your disability is severe, you're not gonna get it. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.   Best bet is to get into a shelter and await your disability, which could take years. I never heard of a shelter that takes it cats either.

1024kui,,j2s6mdh,The home was lost the second they passed. Mom first on the 1st of May, Dad on the 16th. They had refinanced the house after paying off the mortgage, and then cancer hit mom. I tried to be her caregiver for years, but it was too much. I watched as she got worse until eventually, she just stopped. Afterwards the bank refused to work with me cause mom didn't have a will and I would have had to go to probate court, but I didn't have the money for a lawyer, nor would I have been unable to pay the mortgage that they wanted. Mom had paid $700 a month, they told me I didn't make enough to qualify their requirements and even if I did it would've jumped to $1300 a month. I don't make anywhere near that solo.   I can get the hours at work, but with no place to sleep or shower I don't think they'll want me in there, and my friends I'm with now I know they can't help me more than the few days I have left. I don't want to be a bother to them as well, and they've already told me the time limit. I'm waiting to hear back from a different friend but it's looking like her answer is a no-go cause she's living with her parents and her parents don't want anyone else there.

I‚Äôm not trying to scare you, but you‚Äôre a prime target not just for abuse, but for trafficking so try to stick with youth shelters or local shelters and not resort to sleeping bags or a tent. You‚Äôre going to have to be vigilant about your safety. Contact as many resources in the government and shelters as you can to ask for help.   If your friend can house you now see if your school will let you finish remotely. We just had a pandemic and everyone did online school.

You will be targeted in a shelter, so establish a connection to school resources ASAP. Your education councilors need to know about your living circumstances the first time you meet them so that they can help you avail yourself to services and resources you qualify for. Hopefully this will include contacts for affordable student housing and student health insurance/clinic services.  Also, contact your local YWCA to ask about shelter options for victims of domestic abuse.

101x83q,j2ryxzw,,You can quickly and easily get into a room for rent within 3 week.   Facebook Marketplace -> Rentals -> rooms for rent  Prices range from $400 - $900 a month depending on where you live. Many places have furnished rooms included. To move in, it usually costs first months rent and a security deposit (usually around $50-$200, some don‚Äôt require it). You sign onto the lease and get to have a cheap room for 3-6 months guaranteed, sometimes a year contract. There‚Äôs plenty of young women roomating, and because you are a young woman still in school, you‚Äôll be priority (meaning you‚Äôll likely be first choice for many people renting out a room in their home). Many people are very nice and don‚Äôt care about a great credit score. As long as you can pay the rent every month, you‚Äôre good.    This option is much cheaper and quicker than trying to rent an apartment. And because your dealing with people instead of a rental company, they‚Äôll be understanding and willing to negotiate. Also, utilities, wifi, and everything is usually included in the advertised monthly rent, and you won‚Äôt need to worry about buying appliances, furniture for the whole house, and setting up wifi etc. You share the living space, kitchen, and bathrooms with the other house mates (You can easily find one that has all females).    I would say, save up to get a used car (Facebook marketplace is a great option to buy a used car, it‚Äôs where I got mine). If not, Uber or taking the bus. Or, if you work close enough and school is close enough, get a bike to ride around on. Or even a scooter (like a moped), you don‚Äôt need a license and you‚Äôll be able to ride on the street, but not the highway. If you don‚Äôt want to go to school physically, speak with one of your school counselors to see if you can do online school (to get around having to find transportation). They should be able to give you options and tell you how it‚Äôll work. Also, your counselor may be able to provide other useful resources for you if you explain your situation.

101vwew,j2qbkcz,,A shelter won‚Äôt give out personal info due to safety and privacy. You‚Äôd have better luck asking other homeless folks in the community. Someone will know her. If you don‚Äôt find her, you will definitely find others in need of the coat.
101vwew,j2q2ggx,,The last time I stayed in a shelter was in the mid90s. They had a very strict policy about revealing the names of people staying there at night. This was to protect any potential domestic violence victims. It was a co-ed shelter that was only open from dinner time to breakfast time. I can't imagine other shelters wouldn't have the same policy. Especially not a women's shelter.

101vwew,j2q8lim,,Shelters are not likely to give out information.  If all you have is a first name that can make it more difficult.  You could try the cops that escorted her out of the place, but even then you chances are not that great.  You are a good person to remember her.  Who knows, maybe she got the apartment already.
101vwew,j2qqewz,,I don't know if the shelter workers would be willing to (or be honest about their unwillingness to) but you could try calling around and leaving a message for Patricia with your contact information- phone number might be easier for her to access from a shelter than email, or maybe something like "I'm Suzy (or whoever) from the laundromat- I have a coat for Patricia that I'm leaving at the laundromat where we met" if you don't want to have your phone number floating around.
101vwew,j2s30ep,,At the homeless shelter I was a resident at,  if someone tried to contact me, the volunteer or staff on duty at the time that was working at the front end would write down a note on who contacted me with their phone number written down. You would need a last name though.  With that being said, all homeless shelters have different sets of rules with certain privacy rules and regulations.

101vwew,,j2sbrz5,that only applies to health care
101sll7,j2puus4,,The different systems are clashing. I can be out of the shelter from 9-3 (realistically) but I need more food than they provide because I have a health problem and I'm malnourished. If someone were to buy me a healthy meal, I'd be thrilled but I can't bring food back to the shelter. I have a lot to get done in the 9-3 [a trip to the pharmacy can take all day with public transportation]. If I were brave enough to panhandle, I would only be able to eat one meal. Foodstamps won't pay for anything cooked, so I eat at convenience stores and get 1/3 the food I could afford if I had a home.   Maybe gift cards for fast-food?   I'm going to bed hungry, again, because we have a circus every Monday. I'm biased.
101sll7,,j2qbjeg,I panhandle often, and where I live i usually get off pretty well. Due to my loud moral compass, I try to use my panhandling money for whatever what was on my sign, at the very least, essentials.   If there's no other way for you to earn cash, and if it's legal in your city, I'd say panhandling might be worth a try. Just try and take every precaution needed to keep yourself safe, and experiment (but prioritize honesty!) for whatever'll be your best results.   This article's argument is that it stereotypes all panhandlers as swindlers, aggressive, and con artists, when that's not the case.
101sll7,,j2u7qsb,I have learned that pipeline (a compound in black pepper) helps absorption of vitamins and minerals substantially, which may help if you can eat food with black pepper or get popero e or Bioperine:  https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bioperine-and-piperine-supplement-benefits#1.-May-increase-nutrient-absorption
101sll7,j2pligs,,Are the panhandlers US citizens?  If so, they need cash. Regardless of policy, ordinance, or any other bullshit that society comes up with. They need cash just like you do. Because this is America.  Are some of them going to spend that cash on something you wouldn't? So what. That's their choice, and the alternative to granting people their freedom is assuming control over them and thereby increasing their trauma.  Maybe they don't have access to the same medical, mental healthcare, medication, and pain management resources that you do. Maybe the substances that they use to self-medicate are too strong. But none of that changes the fact that regular people need cash.  I will always give what I can.
101sll7,,j2poaqf,Thanks.Im sober.No drinking or drugs.Sometimes people need help for legitimate reasons.
101sll7,,j2ppmt7,I'm glad that you're sober, it is a decision that will benefit your health greatly in the long run.   But after case managing chronically homeless people for 8 years, I see no value in categorizing different groups of people experiencing homelessness. I don't think of one group as deserving, and another as not.   Everyone needs resources of all different kinds, including cash. Everyone has something sacred in them that persists, and that is not erased by their trauma.
101sll7,,j2q075o,Thank you, for being the exception in the majority.
101sll7,,j2r8qha,Substance use is very often self medication for a number of untreated mental health issues people struggle with. Treatment is not as easily accessible as many think. I would invite us all not to demonize it despite the drug war narratives we have all been raised with.
101sll7,,j2u9ath,Well said.
101sll7,j2pok9e,,Anti begging ordinances are unconstitutional imo. That being said, I do hesitate to give cash. I knew a lot of sign fliers during my homelessness. They were not helped by the money they received.
101sll7,,j2r8sz0,Agreed, goes against first amendment
101sll7,j2q0e0z,,Amazing. Almost every word in this entire article is wrong. Saying that it's illegal to panhandle anywhere in the US is just outright fraudulent ‚Äî panhandling is protected speech under the first amendment, and this has been affirmed by the Supreme Court.

1017w73,j2orv1d,,The one that still bugs me is people griping about homeless people with cell phones.  Cell phones haven't been a luxury item in 20 years, they have been practically a necessity to functioning in society for at least 10, and have been available for literally free for 6 years.  With everyone upgrading their phones every year or two, it's not hard to find old models of decent phones or even flagship models handed down or thrown out, and even if they're paying for their service and their phones, don't people realize that the answer to "how can he be homeless if he can afford a phone?" is...  "Well, homes are more expensive than phones, dipshit."
1017w73,j2o4w00,,Yep. They can even have permission to sleep or keep some things at someone else's home and still be homeless.
1017w73,j2m4b27,,When I was homeless, I had a decent (for me) phone and a laptop (well, two. Until one stopped charging, and the other 'lost' it's OS. First laptop was with me pre-homeless, second was just after I got my tax refund/stimulus check.   Without them, I don't think I would have...I dunno, done as well as I did in the year and change I was homeless- talking to my friends helped loads, and I could read things I downloaded when I have nothing to do or I was waiting on something.
1017w73,,j2nktgx,I had a smartphone for quite i while until it broke. Because I had gotten it from a friend before I got homeless, also got a charger from him. Helped a lot.  People have this stereotypes about homeless still
1017w73,,j2yk1ix,Dont know what I would have done without my phone...the two or three days I didn't have mine after it was stolen drove me bonkers just about- partially because i need something to read at least to occupy my mind, and reading the copy of The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy a bunch of times got boring fast
1017w73,,j2yklpv,Yeah I get it. I was on reddit using the city wifi all the time. Until my phone broke when I was at that guy (I dont remember that night clearly cuz of drugs)  And then I got a phone, from someone elsebut it got stolen by another homeless guyI met, cuz I wasnt as careful as I should have learnt to be by then so yeah...  Spent two months without a Phone. Tough shit.
1017w73,,j2yrapg,For some of the time I was homeless I had service, other times I had to use wifi. McDonald's was good about letting me sit there all day
1017w73,,j2ysb5e,I slept in a night open train station and used their wifi. Or they would let us in at the Burger King nearby... I swear that Burger King has seen everything...
1017w73,,j2ywbth,For the first few weeks or so I was homeless, I went to Burger King to use their wifi. After a while management said I (and the other homeless that came there) couldn't camp out all day). It was only when my ex came there (for about a month-ish?) And we somehow started going to McDonald's.   When I was sleeping outside, most of it was spent under a bridge with another woman, but when she checked into a shelter I didn't feel safe there at night, so I moved to a very open spot across the street from the library. After a time I was forced to move by the police (since technically I was breaking the law in Texas). But I think because I actually listened to them, kept my manners and didn't 'fight back', they called the local Salvation Army shelter and gave me a ride to the local health clinic to get the required negative covid test
1017w73,,j2yyhse,Yeah not fighting back is so important. My friend and I got thrown out in the middle of march or april (winter over here fucking cold as if we were in hell). Because she thought back with a power tripping security guard in the station, it was like 3 hours until it opened...  A very shitty night...
1017w73,,j2z08es,One of the cops was pressed against my back (I was coming out of the library to use the bathroom and go get lunch), and had a raised voice. I think I know why they acted the way they did- not everyone (homeless or not) would have been as calm and obeying as I was.  Wish I knew of some ways to help (if you/your friend are still homeless), but there's people in this sub and /r/homelesssurvival that will have better tips than me for very cold/very hot weather

1017w73,j2m49lz,,The sad part is there are fakes out there. There are also folks out there that are fake musicians/buskers. While I agree that not everyone in those videos is a fake it's hard to tell who is and isn't.  I always wore good clothing, kept my hygiene up as best as possible and made it look like I was simply traveling around with more than your average person.
1017w73,j2o3e0d,,I mean there are people out there that have been exposed as fake. They had a house on their social media and what not. They give a bad image to ACTUAL homeless.
1017w73,j2pcubg,,This is something I‚Äôve struggled with for a while now. I‚Äôve been homeless for about six months‚Äî bouncing between homeless shelters and sleeping in my truck. But because I have good hygiene and I‚Äôm not wearing rags, no one believes me when I mention it. I‚Äôve even had social workers try to call me out for ‚Äúlying‚Äù about it. It‚Äôs exhausting.
1017w73,j2pqw94,,There's lots of fakes.  We watched one dude who looked totally legit and I never would have guessed it. He walked across the parking lot and goes to a nice Camaro, only a few years old at the time. He opens the trunk, takes his nasty old jacket and hat off, puts it in the back along with his cardboard sign, and under the jacket he has a nice polo shirt way cleaner than the jacket.     If you have a nice car like that, you haven't been homeless for long. You could easily sell it for more than a years worth of rent + a cheap car.
1017w73,,j2px2nb,It's like gambling though. You never know what someone might give you. You could get $20 in under 5 minutes. Somebody could hand you a $50 or you could be there all day and get $5.

I feel awful panhandling and I'm homeless, I don't know how people do it and are completely lying.  Right now the spot is overrun by two people staying with their friend, one guy staying with his niece and one girl in government funded housing. Don't want to hate but kinda bugs me.
1017w73,,j2pu6lx,Nah if they have housing and food stamps what else do they need money for? Worthless addicts who want their cigars/booze/lotto tickets.... see them always trying to bother people with junk like we are down in mexico
1017w73,,j2py834,Some clothes and toiletries would be nice. Not having soap makes people stink, stinky people don't have jobs. Food stamps and housing are not the only things needed to sustain ourselves, but if we make money higher than the government limit, we lose everything, they take away the assistance immediately, and we're back to being homeless despite making JUST enough money to not be able to afford housing. Section 8 is literally there to make sure we stay poor and helpless and slaves to our lowest wage jobs.
1017w73,,j2q95b2,If they busk they might buy those things but they can get them from other resources, usually busking ia for non health related stuff but feeding addiction
1017w73,j2oa5jw,,People are constantly making snap judgements based on single and/or limited pieces of information. Especially when it comes to people who are struggling whether homeless or in need of assistance in somehow.  It's a major issue and contributes a lot to why things are the way they are where we have people struggling living in poverty, homeless etc... in this country.  I hate it.  People fail to see the nuance of a situation it's frustrating, infuriating and just exhausting to have to constantly deal with having to justify yourself to everyone and everything all the time.

1017w73,,j2obmvt,What kind of stupid response is this?  Do cars not need gas? Or are they required to sell their only asset just so you will feel good about looking down on them?  How should a jobless homeless person who owns a car maintain that car? Or do they just not deserve to keep the car because they don't have a job or home?  Specifically what order is a person required to give up their personal possessions for you to believe they're worthy of help or charity? Once I don't have a house am I absolutely required to sell the car too? Or is there a circumstance under which you'd allow me to keep it?  Not rhetorical questions, be as specific as possible.
1017w73,,j2r437i,if you buy them food/water, they save money on food and water. Then they spend that money on whatever they want, including drugs. So just save yourself time and give them money if you are trying to help lol.
1017w73,,j2ruyny,I get it, but it all depends on the person. I rarely give them anything. Honestly there are so many job openings where I see these baggers. It is really really frustrating. They just stand in a corner. Hold their signs. Yeah I‚Äôm over it. I work two jobs to pay my bills. Some of the homeless seem to have no desire to change their situation. The ones that do that I would like to help.

1017w73,,j2rv5k9,They need to figure it out. Remember, let‚Äôs look at what got them to the situation. It‚Äôs usually a string of really bad decisions and inability to manage their life. And still they can work even with no car there‚Äôs day labor they can do they can post on the local Facebook group ask if anybody needs help and I guarantee somebody will hire them for a day or a couple days work for cash and they don‚Äôt.

1017w73,j2q76dn,,Homelessness has a lot of different looks. I only told a small number of friends about my situation and a few were shocked that I consider myself homeless because I'm crashing in my dad's guest room. I'm lucky as shit, no doubt about it, but I'm here illegally. Once the neighbors catch on that I'm here I'll have to spend chunks of the week in my car so I maintain guest status vs illegal tenant status. Counting my blessings, but it's still not having the safety of *knowing* where I'll be tonight and I can't get regular custody of my son unless there's a place to stay. I think my friends don't want to think of someone they know, someone they relate to and who is as smart and educated as them be homeless because it really makes them confront how few barriers are standing in between *them* and homelessness. So I'm just calling it couch surfing and hiding in plain sight to make everyone comfortable. But it's not like "hashtag van life" was my choice, and I'm so scared and stressed and lonely. I can be thankful for my physical safety and comfort and simultaneously psychologically distressed by the constant threat of that safety being snatched away.    I'm sure this will bother some readers who are in worse positions right now, and I understand that anger. I just ask please skip nasty messages, while I do have lots of lucky things I'm also trying very hard to stay out of the psych ward right now.

Phone the plasma place and set an appointment   Hopefully u get some money from this   I‚Äôm praying for ya
10151ul,j2m4p91,,FetchRewards is a good app to use, but isn't fast the get enough points for the gift cards sometimes. Some 'bonus' items can- the app will say which ones.  Save whatever reciepts you can find that were created in the past...week I think it is? Scan them in the app, and you get points. The base number of points is 25, and goes up depending on what's on the reciept. In my experience, beer seems to be fair in giving out a nice amount of points.  I wouldn't mind tossing a few dollars to anyone that can help me get motivated enough to do some cleaning- I'm very bad at actually doing it.
10151ul,,j2n6drv,I like to put on my favorite TV show and smoke a bowl while I clean. Helps
10151ul,,j2yjo0l,I space out when I get high. Might clean while I'm waiting for it to kick in, but when it does I'm useless XD
10151ul,j2mwq3a,,On Swagbucks I make more if I can do without ten or twenty at a time for a bit. As in, donate 20 to cancer society or ASPCA, get , 40.
10151ul,j2ms9hf,,this isn‚Äôt a quick $ thing, but if you don‚Äôt already use  Ibotta, def sign up. i go through their offers & choose my groceries based on it. you can use it even if you pay with snap/food stamps, so you‚Äôre turning money that is specifically for food into actual cash rewards.  speaking of assistance, if you‚Äôre not against it & you‚Äôve never received cash assistance, you can apply for that. i think states have different limits to how long you can receive it. FL is 48 months i believe. for your lifetime.
10151ul,j2lojzf,,r/beermoney  may have some ideas

10151ul,j2ml9z5,,I like using crowdtap. It‚Äôs not exactly what you are looking for, but you get paid in giftcards and just setting aside a few minutes per day to do surveys can help you get a little bit of extra money (and there are giftcards available for places like Kroger)

1013w4p,j2lu5yp,,That's how you start forest fires. At least clear the area of kindling (dead leaves) and give a little space between the fire and the wooden fence.
1013w4p,,j2pjs5y,We can disagree that's fine and thanks for at least not going on a cussing rant. I knew someone would say this lol. Appreciate the advice but well aware. It was on mud I'd cleared. Area around is wet (plus pour water around it in circle) so I put everything up on big branches that came together like an elevated surface. Was pure ash by time it burnt through so had a good area forned. The ground was wet enough from snow melting not too long ago. Plus I had gallon of water and stuff I could snuff it out quick with. Trust me it could never spread enough to do anything which is why it was like that entire time for hours. Thanks though and hope all is well.
1013w4p,,j2ptn1w,Fair enough, I guess it being wet is pretty safe.
1013w4p,,j2q85dx,üëä
1013w4p,,j2mo9n0,I doubt op is looking to start a fire. If it was me I'd be hogging that heat and not letting my eyes off the fire and I'm sure op doesn't want to melt his spot to ashes..
1013w4p,,j2pkggg,Exactly! There's too much assumption of me somehow just being a random lol. Can understand though maybe if only seen this post and nothing else about me. I was in position where I'd get burned before table and again it was still damp from previous snow. Was a small personal fire and this was as big as it got. Appreciate all the concern though. No need to downvote please.  Also Happy Cake Day üíØ
1013w4p,,j2r0qqx,Cheers brother!

1013w4p,j2mp1lx,,Quietly, at home, with my cat.   I ate a good meal, watched a couple of movies, basically kicked back and relaxed. Exactly how I like major holidays these days. Peaceful, quiet, no drama.   My whole life dealing with people, nothing but. It's nice to have them sans any major interaction with people. Not having to be somewhere, to cook it all,  to clean, to answer to anyone, to have to deal with the seemingly inevitable  drama, it's good.   Don't get me wrong, eventually I know I'm going to have to work harder on making some friends and getting more of a life but right now I'm still mentally decompressing from years of drama and overwork and I'm just enjoying not having it be like that.   This is the first time in my whole life where I get to just relax and put my own well being first. It feels weird but it also feels kind of good.   üòÅ
1013w4p,,j2phpqe,Awesome and can relate. Always thought be kinda interesting to bring along a cat, but there's just too many things to run into when being mobile and also spending most of my day in cafe, temp work gigs, library, gym, etc  What kinda food? Movie? Truthfully can't watch a movie alone lol. My attention span isn't there and my mind is too all over the place.
1013w4p,j2na3vo,,I didn't have much except for that turkey sandwich they brought, but a family member visited me at the forest I camp in and gave me a few beers and a new set of clothing, I feel so thankful. They offered dinner, but everywhere was closed by the time we could find one another, so I settled with a sandwich and water with a bud light!
1013w4p,,j2pditl,Basic, but awesome you enjoyed. So since you got a camp you storing quite a bit of stuff? I'm mobile so I'll use my rucksack as storage and keep it hidden in woods I'm near at any location. You end up getting more food next day?
1013w4p,j2lj1ei,,Looks awesome! Glad you had something great to eat. I have covid so this whole holiday season my daughter and I have been house bound. I think we can finally leave tomorrow as its been since Christmas Eve. This is a great community. I was in a shelter apartment for 4 years and finally got on housing last year but still help out and chat when I can. Hope you have a wonderful New Year. üíú
1013w4p,,j2pops1,Thanks üëç‚ù§Ô∏è Damn that sucks because can't do much about it. So can you explain more about what shelter apartment is? I think I've seen apartments kinda connected to Salvation Army in Vegas. So you've official got like a government assisted place now? Grew up in those with like every possible aid. Hope you enjoyed what you could.
1013w4p,j2muq8r,,Its a street faMiley where I‚Äôm from. Sending lots of love.
1013w4p,,j2pgrmc,Took me a second to understand faMiley was actually gonna Google it lol. That's awesome. This one dude told me how he was like a mayor of one in Baltimore lol. Turned it into a non-drunk and no hard drug use encampment. He'd also have a section to protect women who's escaped violence. Very cool concept and sounds like maybe what you've got going. The right group makes a big difference.
1013w4p,j2lqslf,,I wish you the best.  I hope you are able to sleep peacefully.  Good luck to you.
1013w4p,,j2pn3wt,Appreciate it and you too! I sleep several hundred from here in a park picnic area which is better option than damp ground plus I'm covered from rain. Those have been my default areas to urban camp while here in Illinois.
1013w4p,j2lqxmi,,I can't wait to start traveling again.  I hate being in one place for long.  Set up looks great.
1013w4p,,j2pmdiw,Don't need to share if don't want to but where you at? What place would you think of going to? Same restlessness which I'm kinda concerned about. Worked hard to become a licensed electrician and eventually planning to settle in Vegas. I know couldn't live with the fact of not following my electrical dreams. You not being so free also scares me. Think tradeoff might be I'll take good time off per year. As union member much easier because after finish a project (almost always part of crew doing commercial work) I can choose to not do another project indefinitely till wanna come back. I know electricians who just work 3-6 months. And some who've taken off 3 years to do stuff like flyfishing or other business ventures. Setup was awesome and hope you enjoyed yours too.
1013w4p,,j2pmnxr,I just needed to sit still for a bit to regroup.  I'll be traveling soon as when the weather breaks.
1013w4p,,j2q7w4h,Totally understand. Once things get mundane I feel like body is telling you and sending signal gotta change.
1013w4p,j2q1ib0,,Happy new year! I'm with friends at the moment we were stopping by s place like that. The night sky and hot food make it nice. üí™üí´üéâüíØI felt alone earlier over case mgmt fails. I'm trying to not give up but I told case mgmt I did give up. I'm just going to let my mind rest here where I am right now Im able to lay in a bed that's comfortable and not a prison like place or the truck or shelter.   Today was just painful as well. I took a few drinks and meds and felt a little better. I want everyones situation and mine to turnaround.   üôèüåèüôèüåçüôèüåéüôè
1013w4p,,j2q98by,Awesome, but sucks too. Guess bittersweet is great word for many of our situations. Case manager as in trying to get government assistance or benefits? Totally understand no shelter which is why I'd rather rough it outside. Sorry to intrude but meds for? Hope all is well and always feel free to interact with me üëäüíØ
1013w4p,,j2s3xof,Hi, yeah I hear you on the life. As times I call the digital nomad world. Case mgmt was paying application fees. I'm approved for a place to live, old landlord gives bad reference. Sunk lead.  Meds for plurisy. I was sick last month still thumping along.   Yeah case mgmt said unhelpful things today. Everyday is the same wonderful rejection. the longer I'm homeless the less I care about housing I just figure why bother another day is another month what's it matter. That's what I told case mgmt. Stuff like that. So because I'm warm in a home they can't help me because I'm out of state. Which they have a point but I don't know how to stay warm under 34 degrees. They acted like shelters are a norm. It was very dismissive. I have the wrong case mgmt or care team.
1013w4p,,j3fb4w7,Thanks for sharing. Scary and discouraging thing is it's even confusing for those who are tech and resource savvy along with "experienced". Shit I'm lucky enough to be well put together and here in Chicago, even though temporary, it's a system which easily is so tough to maneuver totally understand saying screw it. Even in Vegas use shelter and applying for services. Maybe emergency. Hot meals although once get EBT didn't matter. So I've lived outside essentially for over a year. Best investments are rucksack and a zero rated sleeping/mummy bag. So besides that food stamps and Medicaid is everything else. Get a cheap gym membership to keep clean. Find a place like shelter, church, etc for mail. Worse case is to call local Department of Human Service to inquire about all homeless help.
1013w4p,,j4j4b04,Me too, it's amazing anything got done in one day or one week. Agreed on asking for help from dhhr. Homelessness and the county, city? They don't care and homeless people are invisible to others.   I drove and flew alot this year. Exhausted by last year. Homelessness is depletion.
1013w4p,j2u1aak,,I ate a can of spinach off the floor because my only pot decided he wasn't friends with the handle anymore. But to be fair I'm not homeless until Monday
1013w4p,,j3f9ny8,Not as bad as most things. I've dumpster dived ton of times for food. Perfectly wrapped. What's gonna happen Monday to cause that? Sorry to hear.
1011nkj,j2l77a9,,I'm way too antisocial to make friends. I think I actually have antisocial personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder. So I just completely avoid people. I do get lonely though and sometimes wish someone would talk to me. It does happen every once in a while too. Usually someone who is on meth or other drugs. They like to talk a lot and I listen and sometimes I really enjoy it. I think I appear non-threatening to them so they just talk to me. I kind of wish I could approach other people to talk to them but I'm really weird and might seem psycho in the way I approach things. I don't have social skills for initiating anything.
1011nkj,j2lji8p,,I get lonely. I think everyone does. I‚Äôm socially awkward, can be a little more honest than some would like, can be unaware of some people‚Äôs social nuances or how they might misconstrue something, and I text a lot when upset instead of yell. If people aren‚Äôt clear with me I miss it. Then it‚Äôs hard for me to trust people even when I have no reason not to, because of past experiences. Like there are people who think I don‚Äôt like hugs because I stiffen up and flinch etc, but it‚Äôs more an ‚Äòask‚Äô, oh and because I usually ask myself before hugging. I like hugs and human contact too. Just my life for a long time growing up was entirely messed up. I like hugs but I easily come off as if I don‚Äôt unless asked.   Sometimes my face is rbf and I have no explanation for it but that it is.   Oh and I‚Äôm okay being alone for times and it even helps me process and cope and recharge etc. As long as I‚Äôm not without my esa of course. Then it‚Äôs just a spiral of flashbacks far too easily and that has the opposite effect and I wouldn‚Äôt last a week.   I‚Äôm anxious around people and sometimes that anxiousness becomes oversharing. Oh and sometimes I overshare because I‚Äôm eager to share something I connect with someone about. Eager to make a friend. Sometimes that is off putting for people to deal with, and yet it never quite matters I know that because I‚Äôve never been able to quite stop. Temper it just enough to be socially acceptable to a point yes, but not get rid of.  Sometimes my way of focusing on my interests can go a bit too deep for some people or simply be more enthusiastic than they want to deal with.   Plus my history makes me both desperately want to see the best in people but also not quite trust it but then give them the opportunity to be. Even though I have a hard time trusting it.   I‚Äôm perfectly aware this all makes me annoying to plenty of people and that is before the physical disabilities come into play.   So yes. While I am ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô in general I have a hard time of it and I get lonely. It‚Äôs hard to find friends that are on the level I want them. That deep soul felt friendship. I don‚Äôt even understand why people call one another friends when they aren‚Äôt actually friends. I want those deep soul felt bonds you treasure for a lifetime and I don‚Äôt want to be the only person treasuring it.   Plus adults are jaded. I‚Äôm hardly the only one. It can be hard to even find people open to being friends. Plus I come on a bit strong to them, and I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to speed run the ‚Äògetting to know you‚Äô phase entirely but I have no idea how I‚Äôd ever be anything else. All I know is I need to bottle it and then suddenly it happens and I‚Äôm excited and it gets away a bit. I do try. It never seems quite enough.   People can both suck and be amazing. Humanity has the capacity to be horrid monsters and knowing just how deep that goes has done me no favors.   So yes. Sometimes I get lonely too. Sometimes I am too terrified or simply too exhausted to act upon it. Sometimes I overwhelm people too. Sometimes in trying not to overwhelm them or simply dealing with my own stuff I give them more space than they want and they think I don‚Äôt value them.  Once friends are made I‚Äôll be loyal to them longer than they are to me, but also if something fucked up happens I‚Äôll never forget it even when they do and then get confused I still remember it and still am hurt by it etc.   Loneliness is par and parcel. I get lonely. Everyone gets lonely. Otherwise who would ever make friends?? Who would want to?  I understand what you are saying though. People can suck. When so many people around you suck it can be hard to remember there is good too. You try with the people who prove to suck in hopes you find those people. It‚Äôs also important to do your best to be the kind of friend you want to have too though. That‚Äôs always important.   Everyone gets lonely but too much loneliness will crush your soul if you let it. The way to stop that is to find your people and if people outgrow one another on a personal level of personal growth etc‚Ä¶then you treasure the time it was good, deal with and process when it was bad, and seek your people again. It can be disheartening when it happens but sometimes it simply does. There will be people that are with us a long time and some people who go opposite. Loneliness is why people tolerate one another‚Äôs bullshit and some abusive relationships exist for fear of loneliness. Overcoming that fear leads to some amazing ones.  I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs what you want to hear but I hope it helps. Loneliness sucks and can be soul crushing in intensity or simply nagging. Yours sounds less like the nagging and more pressing. I hope this helps you feel less alone.
1011nkj,j2lsmz6,,I'm lonely pretty much 100% of the time and I don't know what to do about it.
1011nkj,j2oli1d,,Hi I have a group of friends online and you're welcome to join.  We're on discord and do voice chats daily.  Many of us struggle with lonliness and isolation.
1011nkj,,j2pfazm,Can I join? Lol
1011nkj,,j2pgt5a,Of course!  Please dm me and I'll send you my discord profile so we can chat by voice.  (If you have social anxiety we can also chat by text, but we do require voice chat on the server.)
1011nkj,j2pr4ly,,when i was on the streets I was pretty much always listening to headphones while walking around the city.....to camping spot, rec center, to the mcdonalds for dinner etc. Listened to a lot of live local talk radio. Used to call into a lot of local radio show's and offer up opinion on the topics at hand--i guess to feel like more of a normie...but yea when i was on the streets I was pretty much a one-man-wolf-pack and that was totally OK. Matter of fact when I reflect on it living on the streets by myself, walkin around at night in the dead of winter--were some of the most cathartic and reflective nights i've had in my life to be honest
1011nkj,j2ole9u,,i usually give a person i just meet a few chances to reciprocate if i am nice/giving towards them to see how they act or react towards it. friendship isn't a given thing to me, it's being calculated with what you do and say, not knowing the other person's intentions. of course there will be times when you are lonely. i've tried inviting people into my life and had them not appreciate what i was trying to do or simply not care. some people just don't want close intimate relationships for fear of being hurt. oh well. as long as you do you, you're gonna find people that ARE for you and AREN'T. every friendship starts out as two strangers communicating so don't get to frustrated if you don't know what to say at first. you seem smart enough to strike a conversation with a random person on the public transportation. don't be to giving is all i can say. best of luck, from Missouri
1011nkj,j2p8u8d,,To answer your question. No. I do not. Loneliness does not exist. Exactly in the same way as people saying you need relationships to be happy in life. Wrong. If you are content by yourself.   I suggest you not spend time like that bonding with others. I find it hard to bond with others and even if I spent years with them that would not work with me.   As someone that has survived being homeless it is better to keep a low profile and stay away from others.
1011nkj,j2u1oss,,I have a dog.
100sbf2,j2jnv41,,Yes. I did it
100sbf2,,j2jo4vc,Like I dont currently live in the US but I have US nationality so can I move and go to highschool ?
100sbf2,,j2jp2ex,You won't be able to enter the US without your parents permission if you're a minor. Your parents are going to have to sign documents saying you're going to the US for x reason and that you're going to be living with y
100sbf2,,j2jqkb0,turned 18 a few months ago which is the reason that I might be finding myself homeless
100sbf2,,j2jr6cy,Ah I see. Then yes you could just move and start high school. Issue is most high schools won't accept new students that are 18+ [I had this issue as well, had to start at a new school and none would take me because I was 18]. I ended up having to go to a charter school. I really liked it, but it may be different than what you're used to [we had like 30 students in the entire school and only 2 teachers]. Also make sure your old school can send your transcripts over. Mine couldn't so I had to start over again in 9th grade at age 18 which sucked because I was originally halfway through 12th grade
100sbf2,,j2jsiha,wait what you had to go back like 3 yrs ? that's horrendous  also was it just the lack of schools that accept 18+ in the area or like 99% of them everywhere don't accept, because technically if I'm homeless I can go anywhere in the US no?
100sbf2,,j2jsyx3,Well I was in California. In California high schools don't accept new 18+ students, but its possible that other states do accept them. You'll have to look it up, I don't really know much about other states outside of California.     Yes I had to go back 3 years and it sucked. I made it through 1 year and then I actually dropped out of high school and got my GED at age 20 because I didn't want to be stuck in high school until age 22    Edit: yes if you're homeless you can go to anywhere in the US. I just stayed in California because that's where I was born and raised
100sbf2,,j2jtt38,sadly no info online about the states that accept 18+ students so maybe GED is the only option.
100sbf2,,j2juwv6,I googled it and it seems like you can't enroll when you're 18+. You could do a charter high school like I mentioned [all students were teens in my school or early 20s, I was homeless at the time and my school helped me find a place to stay in], you could take high school classes in a community college, you could do an adult school, or you could take the GED. Most "youth shelters" [basically a homeless shelter exclusively for people in their teens or early 20s] have some kind of education program, where they help you prepare for your GED. So you'll be in a small class with other teens preparing for your GED. Not sure what option works best for you. Perhaps its best to stay where you are, finish high school, and then move to the US
100sbf2,,j2keug3,Georgia does as far as I know. My high school allowed kids up to 21. You'll take a placement test and they'll put you in the appropriate grade according to your score.  GED is also an option.
100sbf2,j2k7flq,,The McKinney-Vento homeless assistance act passed in i believe 2005 or so--made it federal law--you cannot deny a homeless minor access to a public education due to lacking vaccination, birth certificate documents, residency etc due to homelessness. If a school is giving you crap about it cite the act--and if you can't gain traction there reach out to your districts representative/congressperson or their staff and you'll probably find success there rather quickly.
100sbf2,,j2kvoai,A few of the districts near me have a McKinney-Vento coordinator who is somewhat of a social worker for homeless students
100sbf2,j2k3t4a,,well it depends. as someone who was also homeless through high school the answer varies on your situation. are you under the age of 18 and if so who‚Äôs supposed to be taking care of you? are you over 18 and just looking to finish your education? basically if you‚Äôre under 18 and still living with an adult you can go to school while homeless but you better not tell anyone that or come to school actually ‚Äúlooking‚Äù homeless or i can guarantee that an adult somehow will catch on and call CPS to get you put in custody which if you‚Äôre actually homeless and under 18 i think is a fantastic opportunity because CPS has access to grants and financial aid that can really help you achieve goals like getting your own car and house thus making you no longer homeless. but of course situations tend to be more complicated than that & also if you happen to be over 18 i would suggest getting into a GED program
100sbf2,j2khp17,,If you are going to enter the country homeless then be sure to go whatever Department of Social Services you're around. As shitty as those places are they still have information.
100sbf2,j2ktot2,,You should save up more, than come to get a GED. Wouldn‚Äôt you need some type of visa?
100sbf2,j2kymwi,,That‚Äôs called foster care
100lhms,j2ibwz4,,Your ebt comes the same day each month depending on a set schedule. I get mine on the 4th of each month for instance.
100lhms,j2iy88p,,The issue also could be that it's Sunday AND a holiday.
100lhms,,j2j5ses,Generally government services deposits funds on the last business day before weekend/holiday/holiday weekend if your deposit date falls on a weekend/holiday/holiday weekend.   For instance my SS Disability payday is the 3rd of every month but direct deposits actually happen at 12:01 Greenwich Meridian of deposit day, so since I'm in the Central Timezone I get my deposit at 6:01pm on the 2nd. Even though January 3rd  2023 is a business day and technically when I get paid, because Jan 2 is the government observed New Years Day my deposit went through on Friday, December 30 2022 at 6:01pm CST.
100lhms,,j2kvzp0,Food stamps aren't the same. They are deposited on the day they are due, not early. You are correct though, SSI and SSDI benefits are usually paid early if they are normally paid on a weekend or holiday.
100lhms,,j2kvuen,No, food stamps are given on the day, regardless of it being a holiday or weekend. SSI benefits and SSDI benefits can be affected, but they end up being deposited  early, rather than late, in that case.
100lhms,j2iu4wh,,In my state it goes in alphabetical order. I've received the funds as soon as the 4th of the month. It should definitely be standardized throughout the country though.   Check out r/foodstamps
100lhms,j2idq7i,,It comes on the day of the last digit of your social. They definitely should have told you.  EDIT: it's this way in my state and may not apply everywhere. Regardless of the way your disbursement date is calculated, they should have been clear about it with you.
100lhms,,j2jnboj,In California it comes on the day of the last number of your case number located below your name on your EBT card.
100lhms,,j2jiqmd,This is FALSE information for most places. Generally they base it upon 3 factors application date, SSN, and Birthday including year.  I get mine on the 6th because of these factors. If you get your food stamps/EBT on the 10th of the month there's no way it can go by the last digit of your Social. If you have a smart phone there's an application called providers that works well to keep track of your EBT stuff. There's no risk and I use it all the time.
100lhms,,j2jjmes,It is this way in my state. I made the assumption it's the same everywhere and if that's not correct, that's my bad!
100lhms,,j2jtk1f,All good, IDK where you live, your state has some pretty dumb people if they're running it like that. Social security numbers are multiple digits WA stopped this before I got EBT here.
100lhms,,j2kedr0,It's just used to randomize recipients over the first ten days of the month.  Chill your judgementalism.
100lhms,,j2kwgb2,From what I was told, it was to help reduce food stamp sellers, and spread the benefits out to make things a little easier on the systems. Fewer people would flood the grocery stores on the first, unlike before.
100lhms,,j2kwq8b,That's the training I got too.
100lhms,,j2kyg7d,Actually, social security numbers are first three, then two, then four digits. So it is indeed possible to have the last number end in zero, or nine. And it sounds like each state decides HOW they implement the change, but it appears to be country-wide that everyone who receives food stamps will have their stamps given out anywhere from the first through the tenth of each month.

100lhms,,j2kw9df,You can have a social security number that ends in zero. That's where the disbursement would be the tenth.
100lhms,j2kvfc2,,It's based upon the number of your birthday. So 1, 11, 21, 31, you get benefits on the first. If your birthday is 2, 12, 22, then it's the second. And so on, so forth, until your birthday ends in zero. You then get your benefits on the tenth.  Edit: Sorry, saw the correct information, which is that it's based off your birth YEAR, not birth calendar date.

100lhms,j2kbmzm,,It can take a couple days and depends on how often you are spending.  I have gotten a reload twice in one month a couple times.
100lhms,,j2kv6j3,That "reload" is actually the Covid emergency stipend. For many, it will end this month, with next month going back to just one load a month.

So I had to go to my emergency spot I go to in a pinch. Which I only use as a last resort since I have to move the car before 4am because I will be harassed by lot attendants or an attempted tow.
100iwj7,j2mkrcg,,I remember the first new years that I was living on the streets, a friend and I were walking through downtown on our way back to her spot after getting some food. We passed a group of guys on the sidewalk who were very drunk and one of them was a little way away from his friends, pissing in a large stone planter. This was literally *on* the sidewalk of the busiest street through downtown! I couldn‚Äôt help it, I said ‚ÄúOh come on dude! They‚Äôre gonna blame us for this shit!‚Äù  Drunk guy just sort of stared at me drunkenly, my friend laughed and we just kept walking, but yeah, drunk people are the worst.
100gipx,j2hmkuo,,Is it possible that you could live in a room and share during your time at the internship? That could help for a place of a temporary living arrangment depending on which metropolitian city you will be living in.   The only way you could make it less obvious, is if you do not have an excessive amount of your items in your car, that others could look in and see.    Like put a lot of items in your trunk if that is an option.   Other than that, it can become obvious if you do not have any tented windows that you are living in a car.

100ge7r,j2inc7j,,Does seem like a "you" problem to be honest. I think a lot of people in this world are selfish and self-absorbed, but other people genuinely care about others and don't mind hearing their problems or their venting. I am one of those people. I've fed, prayed for, and given money to homeless or complete strangers. I do care about their suffering and life story. Though I think this world emphasizes selfishness and getting ahead by screwing over people, but I think it has more exposure than seeing random acts of kindness or volunteer work with hurting people.   Just seems like you don't care or can show empathy because of your own dislike of sharing your own personal problems, so yes, it's self-projecting that you're doing. I wouldn't say it's bad or good, that's just a decision you decided and are ok with. I'm not the one to judge what someone likes or dislikes.   As for me personally, I got an awesome therapist to talk with about my own issues. No way would I just spill all the beans and tell very personal things to complete strangers. That is, non professional people, that studied for years and know strategies to help with my issues. I mean sometimes I can empathize or sympathize with others if they struggle with similar things I've faced, so therefore I try to give advice or encouragement to them. Though it's not the right place to start talking about your problems, if that makes sense.   Just like drug addicts teaching others about quitting or how they escaped that life style, but that doesn't mean they will start telling their life story or all their problems. Just have to understand the difference, and when it's the correct time to overshare. Meanwhile, others are perfectly ok sharing their issues with a best friend they completely trust, others won't even trust or talk to a therapist.  I honestly don't know why some people care or don't care, maybe it's upbringing and never having opportunities to help others or even give a damn? Such as rich people that don't care at all about the homeless or poor people, it has never crossed their mind nor have they been exposed to it. I guess when people suffer and go through very real and similar issues as those around them, they grow kind and compassionate? Especially to those that are going through similar things. Who knows.
100ge7r,,j2jdneo,Thanks for the thoughtful response.   It's not that I don't care about people per se, but that I hate people taking the liberty and insisting that I should. But right before I wrote this a lightbulb sorta went on. Or maybe it was a seizure idk jk jk  It feels as though since I go through life with enough manners not to make people uncomfortable or assume they ought to care about my problems I feel like what makes another person to feel that they should be important enough to do so. So like, since I suffer everyone should suffer. And quietly, lol.
100ge7r,j2iobir,,Deep post. You‚Äôve put quite a lot of thought here, which means you‚Äôve put even more in your spare time.  I think it shows and tells you‚Äôre caring, aware and intelligent.  Not sure where this may lead, I‚Äôm willing to throw something at the wall (sort of speak) and we‚Äôll see if any of it is useful.   Similarly, I‚Äôve had troubles myself and still do when it comes to where to get started and such.  For me, a recent seizure diagnosis is making so much sense in my troubles‚Ä¶example: imagine having seizures and not knowing it (often, through out the day.)  I‚Äôd make plans, think of building things out of wooden blocks‚Ä¶turn around, then it was like someone/something knocked them over.  I‚Äôd have to make my plans all over again and blocks were often missing.  I‚Äôm still struggling, yet doing much better now with medication and all. If anything disturbs my sleep‚Ä¶my issues increase exponentially. Like last nights celebratory fireworks.  My point being‚Ä¶ Perhaps something medically like this is ongoing with you.   Also, I‚Äôve issues reading and often get words mixed up and meanings‚Ä¶etc. Takes me forever to read over something several times to get a good enough feel of what‚Äôs being expressed depending on how well written out by the author it is.   So yeah, others with lots of issues when trauma dumping (just learned this one) on here‚Ä¶just looks like they took down of the Griswald‚Äôs Christmas lights without care and tossed them into the room‚Ä¶which I entered and then promptly had to leave because it was‚Ä¶just‚Ä¶too‚Ä¶much‚Ä¶stress‚Ä¶for me.
100ge7r,,j2jbz0p,I'm sorry, I don't want this to sound sarcastic at all, but are you suggesting that my wording seems disordered and that you relate to that due to having the condition? Just clarifying because to some degree I do struggle in the way.
100ge7r,,j2jgiug,Your wording is pretty good here I believe.  I am suggesting that I do believe that I relate‚Ä¶in having a tough time expressing/not always finding the correct order of relating communications.  Then there‚Äôs a matter of time‚Ä¶imagine already having trouble with things and then wanting/needing a bit of socialization and in the moment.,.things in my head are making sense, but they sure don‚Äôt come out that way.  I‚Äôll often come across things I‚Äôve wrote and been like‚Ä¶huh? Like, I was doing good and then I ran off the tracks.  On really bad days.,. I can easily get one word out of just a couple or few, such as, on a sign, confused for others and it completely changes the meaning of course.  I‚Äôve always had a terrible time communicating though‚Ä¶pretty sure I didn‚Äôt speak until I was five. Then it was speech classes forever.  Thanks for asking.
100ge7r,,j2jiedi,Ohhhhh ok, that went whoosh right over my head the first time and that was all because of my density not your writing.   And ugh, yes. It causes me a lot of turmoil to desperately need to say but somehow not able to. It's like having the *ability* but not the *capability.* Ouch, God man it hurts just thinking about it and how fucked a feeling it is. I'm sorry friend that you're familiar with this feeling too üòî
100ge7r,j2jiadh,,You‚Äôre not alone with those thoughts, but you are definitely projecting.   And yes, decent human beings should be able to empathize, but I still think it‚Äôs funny (both strange and ha ha), when struggling people ask other struggling people for sympathy, understanding, even money here.   Because I guarantee that no matter how bad they think they have it, someone out there has been through way worse.   And then the attitude becomes ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm handling my own shit so what‚Äôs your problem?‚Äù

100ge7r,j2joumo,,It kinda seems like you want to vent or tell your story, imo. I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre dealing with internalized shame. You and your life and story matter whether or not people really care.   My resolution this year is to feel contempt for things outside my control. Like, feel and act as if other people and their opinions are none of my business and of no concern to me. In the last few years, I‚Äôve found it harder and harder to live among so many clearly selfish and self-indulgent people. Best to remember it‚Äôs got nothing to do with me.   I think I kind of understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I go to a clinic where it‚Äôs just a fact that every client there has had a tough ride and could list a hundred reasons to feel sorry for them. People don‚Äôt act like that, tho. If I went there and started crying about how hard my life is, yes, I would assume something is wrong with me ‚Äî major social faux pas. But, doesn‚Äôt mean I haven‚Äôt let myself grieve and vent and talk as much as I want with a therapist or case worker or a supportive friend who also vents to me sometimes. Everyone deserves empathy. It‚Äôs a matter of context, I think.

100ge7r,,j2mlbvf,You have violated the seventh rule of this sub.
100eo3q,j2ht8mz,,If you took a little time reading through posts on this sub you would find plenty of answers to your questions. In any case, here are my answers:  >1.How long have you been homeless?  I was homeless for 5 years from 2015-2020.   >2.What is one thing misunderstood by people about homelessness?.   There are so many. The main thing that I think people tend to get wrong is not realizing that we are a very diverse group of people. There are people from all different backgrounds, going through all different circumstances.   >3. Where do you usually sleep?  When I was on the street, I slept at my spot. There are a lot of ways to be homeless. If you‚Äôre street homeless (as in no RV, no vehicle) you either carry everything with you all the time and move from place to place, or you set up a spot,  which is a more permanent situation since you generally leave it set up until you are forced to move. I set up spots in various places. Some of my favorites were under freeway overpasses or bridges, usually in a tent.   >4. Is it difficult to get into a shelter or what's the issue with trying to get into a shelter?  Different shelters have different entrance procedures. All the shelters in my area are currently referral only and have waitlists. Before that most of them worked on a first come first serve system beginning around 4:30pm every night. I never attempted to go to a shelter. It just isn‚Äôt a system that would have worked for me.   >5.  Why is it a challenge for you to get a job and improve your situation and do you think there is a way for society to help you?  I would recommend rewording this question. The way it is written is very ignorant as it makes the assumption that the person doesn‚Äôt work or have a job already (many homeless people do) it also ignores the fact that many homeless people are unable to work due to disability. In my case I am disabled and can‚Äôt work anymore, I get a small monthly check but it wasn‚Äôt enough to live on. The only thing that could help me was access to housing where the rent is calculated as a percentage of your income, that‚Äôs what I have now and it‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm not on the street anymore.

100eo3q,j2hhecn,,When I go for my masters in a few years, this subject is going to be my final. I already have mapped out in my head what I want to do.
100eo3q,j2odo4d,,One thing to realize about people experiencing homelessness is that all of them are traumatized.  There is a huge difference in resources/ability between people who live in a home and people who don't.   People who can plug in an alarm clock (for their cell phone), for instance, have an instant advantage in being able to show up for a work interview. Such an accommodation is a prestigious amenity for those who experience homelessness, and is far from common.  Next is the quality of sleep that you get when you are able to lock the entrance door of your home. People experiencing homelessness do not sleep like that. The experience of homelessness means that you are in fight or flight mode 24 hours a day.  The neurophysiologists would point out that this means adrenaline and cortisol all the time. They would point out that your body and your mind are not able to heal from trauma at the same rate as those who have a sound place to sleep in a home, because the states of body equilibrium required for homeostasis (the process that heals you) is not possible without a home.  Since there is no healing on the street, there is no comparison to make between people who are housed and people who are not. The ability and resources available to these two groups with regards to finding, acquiring, and maintaining a job is so far from equal that it is preposterous to assume that people experiencing homelessness "don't want to work".  That said, many do work. They sleep in their cars, or other accommodations, and are able to maintain their jobs through a Herculean effort. They should have the respect of everyone.  Those that do not have a job often have to use tactics to survive that are frowned upon in the housed community. Sometimes it involves black markets, sex work, and theft. A constant element in all of those tactics is violence, and the threat of violence is ever present.  Nevertheless, when you speak to people who have experienced homelessness you will find that trauma is not the only thing left.   The part of them that wants peace, that wants to heal, that wants a home, is still there. The desire to belong to a community, and have authentic relationships is still there.   Even people who appear to be "living weapons" still have the ability to be part of a good community, when given enough chances. But it is not easy.  I like the giving nature of Housing First, but I think there should be more training for people entering a subsidized apartment. Life training, survival skills that pertain to housing, and discussions of healthy boundaries with others should be part of the housing first process, but they are not.   What people need to understand most about those who experience homelessness is that theft and criminal activity does not erase an individuals humanity, and their need for belonging.

100a0lh,,j2gokpw,Yeah, I read that somewhere awhile back. Do they charge you a fee or just outright deny you unless your a customer?. How do you "go"?.
100a0lh,,j2j0q03,It's more because of addicts than general homeless although the two groups unfortunately overlap sometimes. Users will overdose in the bathrooms and die and obviously no business wants to deal with that.  Edited:  Before I was homeless, I went into a Starbucks to use the bathroom. Even bought a pastry to make it more legit. The bathroom was closed with no explanation. Weird.
100a0lh,,j2h0w74,Been denied outright for the bathroom. However Quicktrip always has public bathrooms for everyone so I usually go there now when I need to use the restroom. Even in Phoenix, AZ which is surprising.
100a0lh,,j2gr6u1,Depends on where you live. Some places let you even though they aren‚Äôt supposed to, if you have kids with you, but it‚Äôs also clearly something specifically for homeless.   I know I had a lot of trouble with this when I was homeless(without kids) and back then there wasn‚Äôt quite as much of this.  I know though, even without being homeless even just using public transportation it‚Äôs hard to find bathrooms too many places. Back in Phoenix some parks would periodically shut down the bathrooms specifically to prevent homeless people from using it. It didn‚Äôt only effect homeless people but it was bad enough they intended it to do so.  Edit to add: especially don‚Äôt go to Phoenix az. Even the bus stops are flirting with the ADA just to prevent someone from sleeping on it.   Rich assholes downtown even made them move the camps of people waiting outside cass, one of the only homeless shelters in the entire city, simply because they didn‚Äôt like to see people out there. Do NOT go to Phoenix. It‚Äôs hot, the services often predatory and existing solely to get as much of the funding for anyone but the people they proclaim to help, and especially don‚Äôt go if you have kids and are homeless. Or even just poor without family there or having any sort of disability. Cps there is notorious for not following even there own rules and making up new ones. They will take kids for anything and nothing and if they do it‚Äôs harder to get them back when poor or disabled is the only claims than if you actually did something like drugs etc. There is an entire market of rich people who use foster care to adopt a bunch of kids as if it is a hobby. Do not go to Phoenix az. If you have to go there be invisible.   People there are so paranoid about homelessness and so cps happy we got followed from picking up a pizza on foot after getting off the bus from a home school event down there. People will follow you just so they can see if they can report you for being homeless. We had back packs on because we took water, snacks, and activities for kiddo etc(all the essentials for traveling with a kiddo) with us. I had to stop before we got home and get really loud and take out my phone to record so they‚Äôd drive off.   Don‚Äôt go there. It‚Äôs hell on earth and they don‚Äôt care if you die. It‚Äôs one less body to complain. Pretty sure most of the curfews in place were even cited as being there specifically to ‚Äòweed out vagrants‚Äô. Simply existing outside a space will get you trespassed often too. If you are visible there you are at risk.   I probably only got away with it because I used an old school backpack when I was homeless down in az and looked younger than I was. On the other hand that also drew far too many creeps or people who meant well but really was unwelcome ‚Äòconcern‚Äô trying to lord over me as ‚Äòthe adult‚Äô assuming I was much younger than I was.   It depends on where you live but in Phoenix people who can wait for someone not to be there and find a building to pee on or find a bush out of site etc. If you get caught they will haul you off to jail for public indecency though.
100a0lh,j2jyjmc,,Literally yes.  People who do psychological research have been conducting studies around the world about the impact of the pandemic, and the results are not good.  It's interesting news, because the observations are that since January 2020, people have had changes to their personalities, which is like saying "we found a few places where gravity isn't working" because personality traits are generally considered to be stable and lifelong.  What they have all observed is that people, younger people in particular, have become more neurotic and anxious, less cooperative, more antagonistic, more selfish, and no longer extend the benefit of the doubt to others.  Pretty terrible stuff, bad news for humanity as far as I can tell.  This is one example from the news: [https://www.psypost.org/2022/10/new-research-provides-evidence-that-the-pandemic-changed-our-personalities-64143](https://www.psypost.org/2022/10/new-research-provides-evidence-that-the-pandemic-changed-our-personalities-64143).

1005txw,j2g0qub,,Hey,  I‚Äôm sorry you are having issues with your mother. I know how that feels and my mother has her own issues to the point where I do not want to hold a conversation with her anymore.  I‚Äôve lived in campgrounds and at rest stops in my car. While living at these places I can suggest to you what you may need. First and foremost is to pray to God. Reflect on how you got yourself in the situation in the first place. Ask for forgiveness in anything you may have done wrong. You will begin to see your life open up more with some optimism.  For supplies it‚Äôs really crucial that you utilize food pantries and to make sure you have plenty of clothing at least for 7 days. Socks get lost easy so please account for that. It‚Äôs good you have a gym membership. The workouts alone can make you feel somewhat normal again and the rewarding showers take advantage of.  All in all you are not alone. This is a really good time to reflect on yourself as a person and set measurable obtainable goals to get out of your situation. Maybe it‚Äôs further education or the military or whatever. Point being is that in order to not dive your mind into the bad stuff you gotta redirect focus onto the good. Get proactive in something that is going to build you up.   This is the rock bottom for sure but just know that everything in life is temporary and not the end for you. The biggest advice I could prob give is practicing self care and taking care of yourself physically and mentally. It can get lonely at times so if you ever need a listening ear please feel free to DM.  Happy Holidays to you and I‚Äôm look forwarding to seeing your progression!   Godspeed. üôèüèΩ

I just walk.  I for one am excited for you! You've got this. Learn about resources available to you and maybe make use of some of them. Learn about BPD if you haven't, and for now I hope you can be ok with not being ok from being around that for as long as you have.

1004vko,j2fxa55,,when i was on the streets i always referred to myself as a Vagabond - as I always had a full time income stream coming in but due to felonies and poor credit/evictions in the past just couldn't rent a mainstream apartment--and didn't have the mental fortitude to get along with roommates so I just kinda went my own way for a long time camping in hidden spots at churches and parks--showering and storing duffel bag at the local rec center till I could save up for a camping van. But never was addicted to drugs or alcohol or had severe mental illness--just a string of unfortunate poor judgement--and reaped what I sewed. But there's a huge difference between me with an end-goal in mind (chevy road trek to live in) and someone on P2P meth full time on the streets not bathing for weeks at a time in a semi-permanent psychosis
1004vko,j2fpmjp,,I have no problem with the term homeless, it is what it is. Unhoused is one of those words that puts a more pleasant spin on things. Maybe it's being used to get rid of the stigma attatched to the word homeless but I really don't find it all that affective. I'd rather call a duck a duck.
1004vko,j2g8orc,,Being PC doesn‚Äôt make our situation any better, being called homeless or unhoused isn‚Äôt helping. Whether we live in ours cars (me), shelters, motels, etc; we r all HOMELESS.
1004vko,j2gaqhp,,More PC nonsense, I promise you when you're homeless you have more to worry about then what it is called.
1004vko,j2g3flj,,It makes no difference at all to me. Granted I'm recently "housed" but I truly never gave a shit if someone called me homeless or unhoused or houseless, honestly these new terms kind of just feel like people trying to make themselves feel better instead of doing anything useful about the thousands of homeless people in one of the richest countries in the world.. if it leads to some real change then maybe my viewpoint would change but so far.. it makes no difference
1004vko,j2g4g13,,As someone who works in the policy world, there are several words used to describe homeless in order to make the statistics more meaningful. ‚ÄúHomeless‚Äù can mean anything from sleeping on the streets, to couch surfing, to squatting, to shelter, to Van life, to motel.  Houseless or unhoused or unsheltered means a number of things to specify whether that homeless person has a roof over their head or a permanent mailing address.
1004vko,,j2hwomg,This is great knowledge ! What other categories are there defined by the policy world? Any of these policy makers have ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù background at some point in their lives?
1004vko,,j2hxpnu,Some. I don‚Äôt work in this area but there are a lot of non profits involved that specialize in research in this area.  Some of the social workers and researchers work in that area because they used to be homeless themselves. Edit:  I want to be clear that these people are not defining you or your personal situation. They are just creating key words to assist their own research to produce policy solutions.  It helps divide up services and customer bases.
1004vko,j2gf58y,,I often use "No fixed address"
1004vko,j2ibv11,,It‚Äôs frustrating. People are focused on the words and it distracts from the problem. I am a homeless women, I am a women experiencing homelessness, I am suicidal, or I have suicidal thoughts. Whatever way it‚Äôs worded, I‚Äôm still in pain. The words have not fixed that.
1004vko,j2g5os3,,I think that someone spent government money on focus groups and marketing to come up with a term no one asked for rather than spending that money on actually helping the homeless.
1004vko,j2htnm4,,Homeless: not a choice. Did not choose to be homeless.  Houseless: has chosen to live their life openly (outside, RV, converted school, bus etc ) and not in a permanent building/ house/ apartment
1004vko,j2h4x6i,,This question gets asked here a lot. The consensus seems to be that we don‚Äôt really care. I think the ‚Äúnew‚Äù terminology was popularized and mainly used by politicians and non profits who want to sound sensitive.
1004vko,j2h5kma,,I like to refer to myself as home-less. I totally choose to be this way so i choose less of a home. Home... Less.
1004vko,j2hhsra,,Either way I don‚Äôt get offended, it‚Äôs easier to say homeless than to explain the situation. I‚Äôm currently living paycheck to paycheck in a motel and if the nightly price rises, then I‚Äôll be on the street with a trash bag of my belongings. I was sleeping in a car not that long ago so things are getting better but it‚Äôs still no cake walk.
1004vko,j2i4udq,,Prefer homeless, unhoused seems to imply I ever had a house to begin with.
1004vko,j2ipz8y,,In my experience, ‚Äòunhoused‚Äô is a term used by privileged neoliberals to smugly correct and talk over on-the-ground advocates and actual homeless people. It seems like a strategy to derail in depth discussion and refocus on semantic arguments instead.
1004vko,j2j7xg4,,Gives PC people something to argue about instead of tackling the actual problem.
1004vko,j2jguxa,,The only difference I see in any vocabulary change about my economic status or my "station" in this society, is if it comes with a major change in how I'm treated. You can call me whatever you want, I'm still invisible to society at large. Because being unhoused/ homeless, is an uncomfortable sight for people with so much excess. This society is all about comfort & entertainment. So naturally, anything that's uncomfortable to see gets tuned out. That happens to include people like me. This also addresses the problem of basic human rights, which include dignity, the right to a safe living space, the right to have a livelihood & autonomy over their own lives & bodies. The term "houseless" whittles the entire situation down to not having a house, regardless of whether or not you have a shelter. The reliance in this society, on owning land for even the most basic amount of human dignity, is terrifying. It is only a version of serfdom, with shinier toys & more steps to climb up in station, equalling respect. So, no, changing the word does not affect me in the least. If it inherently changed how I'm treated or how the entire situation is handled, I'd be all for it.
1004vko,j2ge2gp,,The government uses terms of unsheltered vs sheltered homelessness. Unsheltered being those.. without shelter
1004vko,j2hcoc7,,Since I moved around a lot, when I was homeless, I considered myself a nomad
1004vko,j2ibpdb,,Cops just called me transient when they harassed me or arrested me for being homeless.
1004vko,j2ojjio,,changing the word doesn't change the connotation.
10038e5,j2fkmr7,,Alameda has a designated overnight safe parking lot and also safe places to park if that place gets too real. It's normally fine, and always safe, but it's where the cops dump homeless people with untreated schizophrenia, and sometimes newcomers aren't considerate of everyone in the lot, so they blast loud music late into the night or let their dog bark all day. The obnoxious people disappear eventually.  If you need a break from the lot, there are good places to stealth camp. Lots of weekly shower locations and trailers and free laundry. Plenty of grocery stores and public restrooms. 24 hour gyms are nearby.  There's a day center there with free meals, free coffee and wifi that reaches the parking lot. The restroom is available all day and night and is kept clean. They don't have curfews and don't kick you out in the morning, but you have to sign in daily to use the day center, and nightly to use safe parking, after filling out intake forms and agreeing to the rules.

10038e5,j2hfl2e,,I live in the SF Bay Area and, yeah, Vallejo has a reputation for being a bit "rough". There are some other places like parts of Oakland and Hayward which also have a reputation for being a bit rough, although gentrification over the years has reduced the number and size of rough areas. Most of San Francisco is OK, or at least no worse than any large city. As someone else here mentioned, though, avoid the Tenderloin, the South-of-Market-Street (SOMA) area, and areas around the Civic Center. Generally speaking, it's not too difficult to sense which parts of the Bay Area are the rough areas.
10038e5,j2jm6nd,,Welcome to the Bay ü•∞ there‚Äôs also safe parking sites out here in the Tri Valley area and it‚Äôs very safe and nice. Tri Valley meaning Pleasanton, Dublin, and Livermore.

10038e5,,j79y17f,Going to be in a similar boat soon in San Leandro. Have you figured anything out locally?
zzt58m,j2e9ds0,,This is why I found a secluded spot on the edge of town and make a campsite so I don't have to worry too much about where to go. I can wake up, start a small fire make myself some coffee, wash up with a wet rag or baby wipes and head to a temp agency for day to day labor to get some money in my pocket. Holidays I'd just putter around my campsite breaking down wood for fire needs, making my camp more comfortable, I'd fish (string stick and a hook) as I usually set up on a water edge, when I wanna just relax I would watch movies I downloaded onto my phone last time I was near good wifi.   Sometimes I'd dumpster dive at grocery store for things that were still good but expired to cook up and share with other people in similar situations as myself. We'd go to a park and use the grill to cook up steaks frequently as it was common the expensive steaks at this one store never got purchased and would be tossed out package and all. Perfect condition just dated so it couldn't be sold. So on cooler days they would still be good by the time we could sneak back there and digg for them.   I've made many homeless banquets on a wood fired park grill and a couple sticks to flip and serve.   Some resources are less obvious and less desirable but you can really live well if you're willing to go the lengths. Or maybe I'm just glorifying making the best of a shitty situation.  Living close to resources can be convenient but it can take it toll. Less ability to make or find shelter, more people meaning more danger, not knowing where you'll sleep the next night. It's more miserable than necessary.

zzt58m,,j2g5kcd,I've never heard of a Walmart with armed security and it's wildly inconsistent with their corporate policies. In general, Walmart will not trespass you merely for not shopping enough. They will trespass you if they believe you're stealing (and this normally means you are stealing and they've got you on video) or if you're harassing people. But if you're just hanging out, keeping to yourself and not bothering people? They don't care.

zzrkd8,j2dmgm1,,Everyone deserves death with dignity. Mental illness is suffering and no one should be forced to live like that for years on end. Mental illnesses aren‚Äôt as easy to treat as everyone believes. People think taking pills or getting out of poverty is all it takes, but that‚Äôs not true. There are a lot of people with comorbid conditions that will never find peace, there are people with treatment resistance, there are people with reoccurring symptoms who go in and out of treatment over and over throughout their life, and there are people who deserve to have a way out for the simple reason of saying they want one.   The screening for this will not be willy nilly. It‚Äôs still Canada. No one is walking in off the street and leaving with a dose of euthanasia.
zzrkd8,,j2m7acr,Saw a video on YouTube of a woman that chose euthanasia because nothing worked for her mental health problems.  She got approved once, and decided to not go that route for a few years, and then made her final decision to 'go through with it'

It should probably not be proactively offered by any one of the system though it should be the kind of thing where you have to request it and authorities are not allowed to even mention it as a possibility maybe only something like a pamphlet but never something that is given to a patient or said verbally as an option.

I find it annoying that some doctors may require proof of ‚Äúterminal illness‚Äù but I suppose I understand why. When people‚Äôs basic needs such as shelter, safety and food needs are not met than of course more likeliness to suffer from mental illness/ depression but in my case I feel like I‚Äôve been dehumanized and lack a sense of belonging. My family has always been dysfunctional, and my friends are mostly fair weather friends. I also was born premature and things that come easy to most people do not come easy to me. It‚Äôs been too hard for me to keep up with the rat race and other than some traveling I want to do, life is generally pretty lonely and unfulfilling for me. I look forward to eternal sleep and leaving the stress of survival behind.

zzrkd8,j2ds03u,,I don't like how this type of euthanasia has a centrepoint on the poor, the homeless, or those in poverty. It's really fucked up how just because someone isn't well off, or living differently to others, a lot of people think it's acceptable to talk about culling them. A quick, easy death should be for those in pain, so much so that it is unbearable to live, or for those who don't want to continue living anymore, not because of depression, or any other mental illness, but because they are of sound mind and have simply decided that they'd like to clock out.  We shouldn't offer assisted suicide as a solution to "not making it" in the world, for not being rich or for being homeless. It's fucked up and anyone who has this tunnel vision for assisted suicide on the less fortunate needs to revaluate themselves.
zzrkd8,,j2etaem,Mental illness can cause suffering equal to or worse than physical pain.
zzrkd8,,j2ew4c2,Yeah, I know. As long as a person holds fair reason and judgment they should be allowed to make that choice.
zzrkd8,,j2kr7ar,Can you clarify? Would you consider someone suffering from lifelong major depression and PTSD to have fair reason and judgement? I feel like your trying to say that the mentally ill should not be allowed to end their suffering and die with dignity. Now if your talking about a person experiencing a psychotic break then sure.
zzrkd8,,j2md8ko,Despite having depression, or CPTSD/PTSD, if a person can hold fair reason and judgment over themselves and the view of life, then they should be able to make choices on their own. A person suffering sever depression doesn't think like those without, they have what some considered a warped view of life and death. I think despite serve depression or any other mental illness akin to this, we should not offer suicide so quickly. We should strive to help people live their lives to the fullest despite their disadvantages and not doing so casts a clear lack of unimportance on human life. We shouldn't take it off the table, because then we suggest that a person doesn't have a right to life or death despite their shortcomings, but we also should discourage it. People live with depression for years, decades, it never really goes away in most cases, and yet people can try and many have strive for a fulfilled life, they can rely on others not to give them any easy way out, but to know it's there, and lift them up from that.   The biggest difference is the different way of thinking about this type of suicide: easy/hard way or a safe/dangerous way out. Many, many people who want to die don't really want to die, they want the pain to stop and see killing themselves as the only way out. Those who want to clock out see death as a kind of endless sleep, the next step, not a solution but a choice.  Those who see it as an escape should have massive support and help, and once they can rationalize death as something that doesn't take the pain away, they should be considered a person who isn't at risk of regretting.
zzrkd8,j2egvkk,,I'd do it if it were available. If I ended myself on my own, they'd no doubt blame my diagnosis like they did my friend, funny how a diagnosis is enough to justify a suicide, so people can shrug it off saying well couldn't be helped. But it could. Because they never use a diagnosis to justify helping people so they don't kill themselves
zzrkd8,j2gaay2,,I believe it will be used in the near future as a budget-saving measure by killing people off that are too costly to care for.  The reason for this, is because like everything else in our societies, the way it will be regulated and developed, it will be decided by the top. Not by the majority.  Just like how the best advanced treatments for cancer and other diseases are reserved for the rich.  I believe the masses will be steered into it, just like the majority of humans have been steered into barren childless lifestyles for the past 30 years.  The middle and working class elderly will be left with fewer and fewer resources, savings, and quality of life, until they will eventually be pressured or encouraged to take their own lives, because it will be the only affordable option.  Euthanasia will become the standard. Living into older age will be reserved for the rich and others few elites deemed deserving.
zzrkd8,j2de9qd,,If the doctors can tell their 100% sure and theres no improvement over 15-20 years time im ok with it obviously ud need some doctors that can absouletly make sure thats what they want so yea if u got good enough reason with no improvements.

Maybe in places like North Korea they won‚Äôt let you commit suicide but you can‚Äôt be homeless either you have to work. In Canada you have freedom.   I think euthanasia for mental illness will encourage suicide and increase suicide rates. It would have to be a last resort after trying many other treatments over a long time. When people are vulnerable like homeless people it‚Äôs hard to justify euthanasia but if they‚Äôve been homeless for years and tried hard to improve their situation and hope is unrealistic then it would be more acceptable.   People can also be too mentally Ill to be able to make the decision. It‚Äôs a slippery slope and my instinct is that euthanasia is never an appropriate treatment for mental illness. While it‚Äôs not ideal it‚Äôs the safest option.   How can you really decide that a patient will ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô from death? Pets are put down for physical health problems, not because they‚Äôre depressed. The difference is that if you are dying slowly from a physical illness euthanasia prevents suffering a long painful death. So for terminally ill patients it makes more sense. While mental suffering is just as bad or worse than physical, I don‚Äôt think suicide is a sensible treatment for mental illness 99% of the time.
zzrkd8,,j2dgtxc,You are forced to be alive by nature. Most su!◊õide attempts fail because the human body survives almost everything and the only methods that assure quick, painless and safe death are inaccessable, so you're forced to be alive.  Indeed, some people can be saved, and if they want to be saved, they definitely should. But help should be given on time before it's too late and the abuse becomes permanently traumatic. Permanent mental suffering does exist. Why prolong their agony if they can end it humanely?  Saying depressed people can't think clearly is a slap in the face of the weakest in society. If they can't think clearly, this implies they are not allowed to have any option to make any decision about anything. It implies taking away their control over their own lives after they've already suffered too much from this very lack of control. When Stephen Zweig ended his own life, you can tell by his su!◊õide note he was in a very clear mind and he decided he's had enough and it's time to go. If you take away the right to from people, you inherently take away their control over their lives and force them into undesirable situation that go on and on and on for decades.    How can you know if they benefit from death? It's not simple, but you can see how much they've suffered in life and ask them if they want to wait a little longer to get better or are they too tired of the struggle and just want to go? I think this euthanasia should be an option in any case, but it shouldn't be forced or rushed onto people.
zzrkd8,,j2dsnkp,I agree and I see why it would have benefits. I‚Äôm not against it being legalised but I find it worrying. When I said some people can‚Äôt decide I was meant cases like psychosis which does impact your judgement and can be temporary. There are so many opportunities for it to cause harm or be abused, there are so many difficult questions and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs up to other individuals to decide, like should there be an age limit? It‚Äôs like how the death penalty is bad because innocent people might be tried guilty. If you accidentally kill someone who you shouldn‚Äôt have, you can‚Äôt undo it. That risk makes me worry because the desire to end one‚Äôs life due to mental illness is much more common than untreatable cases of mental illness. Anyway I‚Äôm not against it and I definitely see how it might help some people
zzrkd8,j2d72vy,,I believe that the leaders of every nation which elects euthanasia for any reason should be spit roasted and served to their families.
zzrkd8,,j2d8gjj,What if people suffer permanently and there's no help for them and they're in so much pain they can't function and they'd rather die?
zzrkd8,,j2fk992,Suicide. Hari Kari. Whatever their culture and beliefs allows. It's their choice. No govt should be able choose when a person dies and how. The only people who deserve to die are pedophiles and rapists. No one, not even the parent, has a right to say what level of developmental differences in a person is unacceptable.
zzrkd8,,j2ddt6m,[deleted]
zzrkd8,,j2di93p,That's a terrifying prospect. You're saying that a person's pain and troubles in life follow them after death?
zzrkd8,,j2eziuu,who out there is such a case??
zzrkd8,,j2dip56,Are you saying you're okay with it for terminal illness or indifferent to it but if a person doesn't have a terminal illness it is instead mentally ill or just doesn't want to be alive for some other reason that's where you are strongly opposed?
zzrkd8,,j2evpdp,People who advocate for euthanasia should be killed. That's you. That's what you sound like. Are you okay? Do you need to be euthanized?
zzrkd8,,j2fkx2m,Theres a fine line between euthanasia and serial murder and psychopathy, I agree. Euthanasia is the Delicator of Eugenics.
zzrkd8,,j2etqs1,So forced suffering?
zzrkd8,,j2fl6yh,No. The sufferer has a right to end their own life. Euthanasia is a govt program based on Eugenics designed to remove undesirables from their populations. Govts have no right to say who may/not die, when, and how. Except for maps and rapists.
zzrkd8,j2dfvbz,,Why do you need the government to euthanize you? It's easy enough to do it on your own if you really want to. And aren't mentally ill people not in their right minds anyway? So how can they make a sound decision legally or does their doctor decide for them?
zzrkd8,,j2di3ho,I'm involved in another forum where this is brought up. Basically do it yourself methods are scary and violent and not guaranteed to succeed potentially leaving you in a worse position. For instance we have people that have lived through shooting themselves in the head and now are still alive but with brain damage. We have people who jump off Bridges which is a terrifying act and they still survive. I have a friend who's rehearsed committing suicide and wanted to do it many times but just can't bring himself to do it. He's fantasized about having a big jar of pills where most of them are benign but one of them is the pill so every day he takes a pill and goes about his life and one day his troubles will be over.    So the debate isn't about legalizing suicide because it's already available the debate is about making it so that our society and medical profession is allowed to help you do it without so much fear and uncertainty and pain.  As to your question about mental illness, most mental illnesses do not render you incapable of making such choices. Sure some people are so far gone they don't even have a sense of where they are or have ability to make decisions and also people with things like mania aren't necessarily in the right mind to make a decision. But for things like depression schizophrenia when managed bipolar when they're not in the middle of a manic episode dissociative identity disorder and a whole host of others the person is by and large here with us and aware of their condition and aware of how much pain they are in.  For those that are so mentally gone that they cannot make and informed decision, as far as I know we are not discussing coerced euthanasia yet which generally would be understood to be murder.
zzrkd8,,j2dib1f,Most su!◊õide attempts fail because the quick, painless and safe means are inaccessible. Mental illness doesn't equal lack of clarity of though. Mentally ill people still work, study, drive cars and vote. When they say depressed people can't think clearly, they don't ask them what they think is the best socio economic policy for their country, nor they ask them about their opinions about philosophy, religion, society, culture or other stuff. They only say they lack clarity of though only in regards to their thoughts about death, like this is the only way to measure clarity of thought.
zzrkd8,,j2eturc,Why do you write suicide like that?
zzrkd8,j2eqyxu,,Not all mental illness is treatable and some people suffer for life. Mental illness can be terminal but should that be the cut off, if something is terminal? Should someone be forced to suffer or allow to die with dignity. As long as it is a thorough process with oversight and a long enough waiting period, say a minimum of a year, then people should be allowed to choose dignity. Yes there should be a lot of oversight but it is cruel to force people to suffer. No one should have to die alone or worse botch it and end up suffering worse for how ever long they live. No one is also saying people shouldn't get the medical help and services they need. People should be lifted up when ever possible but that doesn't mean we force people to suffer.
zzrkd8,j2erucr,,For most mental illness I'm not an advocate. Mental illness can be treated. It's not like having terminal cancer or some kind of disease where you waste away to the point where you're locked inside your own body and can't move.   I have issues with chronic depression, C-PTSD and anxiety. I was abused by my alcoholic  parents and bullied to the point of misery as a kid by other kids. Suicide has always been a constant thought in the back of my brain since I was like 5. I was homeless for 5 years plus which did not help at all with that.   While I was homeless I thought about it all the time. I felt subhuman and I was in so much pain physically and mentally I honestly wanted to just close my eyes and die. I was technically in therapy at the time but the therapists I had did nothing to help.   Flash foward and I'm housed and doing much better. I have gone whole weeks without dark thoughts. Being housed and stable, having an income that pays my major bills that helped me a lot. So did not having to take care of or answer to anyone for the first time in my life. I finally terminated any relationship with my toxic bunch of half siblings too.  Not allowing anyone in my life who is toxic and who might disrupt me mentally or who might bully me. Finally learning to say NO to people who just want to use me or abuse me for whatever reason that's been a majorly positive thing for me. First time ever that I put me first and you know what? I'm truly content with that and genuinely happy for the first time in my whole life.   It's still not easy sometimes. I have a couple of autoimmune diseases and major back issues. I have bad chronic pain issues and arthritis to the point where I am just in agony some days. I still get cranky and think dark thoughts when I'm really hurting but thoughts of suicide are few and far between these days because I like my life and who I am now.   I've been through hell and back several times this past decade. I lost almost everything and I had to basically claw my way back to sanity and stability. I'm proud of myself that I did that. I'm still working on getting a life and dealing with major pain and illness but it's BETTER and when the dark thoughts intrude I can put them on the backburner and not dwell on them constantly.   If I had a terminal wasting disease or was going to die horribly from some major cancer then I most certainly would head to someplace like Canada where I could terminate my life when I was ready. I'm not a masochist and I'm not traditionally religious.   I don't believe in suffering for the sake of it. I have my limits in terms of how much physical pain I am willing to endure. I don't particularly relish the thought of a truly painful death. But killing myself for mental reasons? Nah. That I can deal with, live with.   I'd have to be very ill physically to consider it. I do believe in death with dignity and that it's my right to decide for myself what to do in extreme circumstances. I will never judge anyone else for their choice even if I don't agree with it. But for me mental illness just isn't a reason for euthanasia.
zzrkd8,j2f1bse,,*Dr Kavorkian enters the chat*
zzrkd8,j2f6z4k,,I don‚Äôt think people should kills themselves, but what I believe shouldn‚Äôt play a factor as what people do with their own bodies.  I believe legitimate help should be offered to people before they kill themselves and also there should be many months of waiting period or a year, and periods of intervention to makes sure that a person has throughly thought about it, and it‚Äôs not an emotional response to a short term problem.
zzrkd8,j2ftpza,,Everyone should have the right, if they are of sound mind and not under duress, to end their life if they freely choose to do so. It's their life, and they should be able to do as they wish with it. However, being trapped in poverty and isolated from social support by the society around you is clearly a form of duress. These are not decisions being made freely by Free people ‚Äî these are people acting under duress to escape the torment being placed on them by ending their lives. It's an absolutely disgusting situation.  And I was go as far as to call it murder. It is murder through physical, mental, social, and financial abuse to the point that a person's survival mechanisms completely fail. It is no different than psychologically abusing someone until they commit suicide ‚Äî except that you're throwing in an entire system of societal abuse along with it. If we lived in a just society, then those implementing and performing this euthanasia, as well as those who have driven these people to make that choice, would be held accountable for murder with all that entails. The fact that we have reached such a disgusting point is proof that our society is inherently unjust, and its existence is no longer justifiable. These are gross human rights violations, and we must find a way to hold those responsible for accountable, otherwise it's only going to get worse.
zzrkd8,j2fw5hx,,Absolutely ridiculous to allow someone with mental illness to make a decision to end their own lives, by definition they are not capable of making a rational decision in their current state.
zzrkd8,j2fwtzw,,It's honestly horrifying to me. I have bipolar disorder, and there are times when it takes you completely out of touch with reality, for days, weeks, or months-long episodes. How do you establish that someone with a severe enough mental illness to request this, is in a stable state of mind to choose death? That does not compute.  For most mental health issues, a LOT can be resolved through proper support, including lifestyle changes, therapy, and medication. It is extremely rare to have a truly medication resistant condition.  Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, as they say. I think it should only be self-administered, if at all... to allow the person complete freedom to back out at any moment. I don't think any government or healthcare official should be given this power. It goes completely against the most important tenant of medicine, the Hippocratic Oath, "First, do no harm."  The mentally ill population is so underserved. This can't possibly be the best solution that a government could come up with. The current state of access to a proper diagnosis, therapy, medication, support groups, emergency services... is abysmal. Maybe one day when all of this is accessible, we can talk about assisted suicide for the mentally ill. But in this landscape, we need to do better on behalf of the living.
zzrkd8,j2g3ebw,,It‚Äôs your life.
zzrkd8,j2glj7w,,Legalized homicide. Leave while you still can.
zzrkd8,,j2ndynk,You think these people can be saved?
zzrkd8,,j2pi1pv,Yes. I think some might have been misdiagnosed. Others might be romantically challenged. In the Netherlands people on disability who received services from an escort reported being much less depressed. People also mainly use suicide as a way to get attention. Most survivors instantly regret their decisions. Maybe if I was exposed to 20 grays of radiation I might not want to suffer through that. But people who have treatable conditions or just need to get laid shouldn't be getting a pass for suicide. Doctors aren't perfect and our system can give someone the run around for years with a misdiagnosis. A lot of people have been given only months to live and survived another few decades. I could also see people doing this to family members to speed up getting their inheritance. Also the ethical concerns behind the use of a person's remains.
zzrkd8,j2h0sf7,,What would the actual law BE?   To my knowledge there are a few States or Counties in the US that allow for a person to in essence ask for "life" termination. As far as i know though this procedure can only be used for persons who have terminal diseases.    I get the fear of it. As much as i actually don't want to live myself I know that i took like that can for sure be used for evil.
zzrkd8,j2h40jt,,People are too greedy and selfish to help these people. Their lives will never get better. The solution is easy - lift out of poverty. Thats the last thing anybody wants to do. Thats why im interested in it myself. F this world. No hope here anymore. Humans are disgusting.
zzrkd8,j2h4qni,,The way you described how it‚Äôs going to work is far from reality. You must be severely mentally I‚Äôll in order to get the euthanasia and multiple therapists and psychiatrists must sign off that this was the only option for you, and if just one says no then it won‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs going to be used very very rarely
zzrkd8,j2jpdv8,,In a better world, u would not ever live in fear of poverty or not able to live reasonably comfortably. In our modern society I feel like people choose assisted suicide because they don‚Äôt think they can reduce the suffering or access things that would cure them from suffering. So as much as I think it is wrong, if a person has no hope of not being in excruciating pain etc, maybe it is humane in some cases.
zzrkd8,j2e0egr,,It's eugenics and I see nothing wrong with it. If people can't make it in life they should have the option to die comfortably. I'm saying this as someone who feels inferior and will probably never make it in life. This happens in nature all the time. I saw a video recently of a mother stork pushing her weak baby out of the nest so she could better take care of the others. Sometimes there's just nothing we can do for some people and there's no sense keeping them alive. This is something society has mostly ignored and instead lied to people and told them there is always hope. There isn't always hope.
zzrkd8,,j2eu03t,Giving people a safe and comfortable means to end their suffering is not eugenics.
zzrkd8,,j2evax2,Eugenics (/juÀêÀàd í…õn…™ks/ yoo-JEN-iks; from Ancient Greek ŒµœçÃÉ (e√ª) 'good, well', and -Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒÆœÇ (gen·∏ós) 'come into being, growing')[1][2] is a fringe set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population.  Killing off inferior genes improves the genetic quality of a human population.
zzrkd8,,j2kqf30,No one is killing anyone. It self induced and it doesn't say anything about none of them having children.
zzrkd8,,j2kqu29,They're literally giving them injections and it's really not all that different than lethal injections for the death penalty. It doesn't matter whether it's forced or not. People who are inferior dying means they won't contribute to the gene pool. This is not hard to understand. It's eugenics. The weak and the mentally ill dying off cleans up the gene pool, and the government is facilitating this.
zzrkd8,,j2eudhe,How is removing inferior genetics not eugenics?
zzrkd8,,j2f87z7,I think everyone feels inferior at various points.  People fake confidence a lot.

zzbvjh,,j2eayua,I don't know the history of anyone involved here but assuming the best maybe the commenter is less trolling and more trying to warn people not to run blindly because someone claims they will help. People experiencing homelessness are often promised things for them to find out after there are conditions attached.   Loads of people are done horribly by people supposedly wanting to help. People have been poisoned, beaten, robbed for what little they have, and even lured in and killed.   Sadly the kind of gesture op is offering is not very common for some so they would feel very guarded in response to such an offer.   All in all I hope we can get along and help each other more often as there enough shittiness in the world as is.
zzbvjh,,j3b2edi,Yeah, I thought the same of him too, until we had a back and forth about how he felt I was lying about how I became homeless, that debt doesn't cause homelessness...it went on for a while and he deleted the more insulting comments, but yeah, turns out he was just a troll. I'm not in a good place, but I do feel bad for this guy. He gets something from trolling people that are down, it's tragic that someone needs that.
zzbvjh,,j3c625l,Debt causes homelessness to say otherwise is trolling without a doubt, or complete ignorance at the very least.

It provided rental assistance for those who were homeless or in danger of losing housing.  As with most states, there are town welfare programs and Community Assistance Programs through the county but they don‚Äôt just hand out money‚Ä¶ there are stipulations and an application process.

zz08a3,j28zy2p,,Go for the apartment, a place with sturdy walls and lock on the door will be better than living on the street or out of a tent, even if it is in a bad part of town. Get a weapon of some kind- pepper spray, a taster, a gun if that's legal where you are to protect yourself.  Go to food banks, they are there to help. Go to other charities or shelters that can offer food, maybe even a route to work that will pay better will show up there. I would get a bike, though that's more money. However, once you get it, it costs very little in maintenance compared to a car. Look on places like facebook marketplace, or other sites that sell stuff like that. Usually you can get them for much cheaper then retail price and if you're really lucky, for free.  Don't waste money on the hotel, or stay there as little as you can. That's money you're using instead of putting it towards the rent for the apartment.  If you have free time, volunteer at the food banks. You'll make friends, build a security net around you and you'll be helping people all the while.

zz08a3,,j2c7qv4,Depends on how homeless you are. If you can afford four walls do it, if not, live out of your car, get those insulators for your windows. If you have a job and have nothing else, get a hammok. This in my personal opinion is better than having a tent if you are living out in the woods, but having a  hammok is easier and overall, in the the long run, cheaper than having a tent. A hammok with a snake skin to get you pack away within minutes will be invaluable. Plus, if you have no home, invest in a single person kelle kettle. You can cook while boiling water. If not, I have small portable stove that cost me about, at max, ¬£40 with small pots and pans that came with it.  If you're alone go to a shelter, but seek out a place  you can bug out safely, just in case. Don't be afraid to ask for work and more importantly, don't be scared to ask for help. Some people are mean but most of us are nice. Just trust your gut and you will be ok. If you have a job but no place to live get a gym membership. It's a warm place plus you have access to showers and most of the time, a place to store Important things.

zz08a3,j296r3h,, Hotels are way too expensive and not sustainable. I would see if you could rent a room. Maybe if you and your mom put your finances together you might be able to get a hotel affording a hotel is a battle and you need to consistent income so your mom would need a regular paycheck.   I would absolutely get the apt even if it‚Äôs in a sketchy area that is super cheap but you need deposits and stuff most likely. Also, are you open to renting a room? Renting a room too close to work as possible is another good option. What is your mom going to do? Is she on her own? She needs to figure it out. You cannot let her bring you down now. I hope your mom has a job and income She‚Äôs gonna need a place to stay as well.  If you rent a room, make sure it‚Äôs with another female

zz08a3,,j2a3vn2,I am sorry to hear that. You cannot let your mom bring you down or have you end up homeless again. If she is not going to treat her mental illness or help manage it there is not much you can do. She can figure out her own housing.  Craigslist and [roomies.com](https://roomies.com) have alot of ads for roommates or call an apt locator service. If you get the sketchy apt sign a short lease if you want and secure all the doors and windows.

zz08a3,j29od1p,,Consider renting an Unagi Scooter. They are around $60 a month and the new ones go 20 miles before needing a charge. My boyfriend snd I rented the scooters until we saved up for a car. Lifesaving and pretty fun.
zz08a3,j2a8upt,,Sounds like you and I are battling with the same issue. Having a parent who fails to address their own mental health issues can be detrimental to your own health. Just make sure to take care of yourself before you can help anyone else. It‚Äôs good that you have a high paying CNA job where you are clearing around $2400 a month.   I think everyone on here is in agreement that the apartment is prob your best source right now. Hotels are extremely expensive and not worth it. Being homeless in your car is not fun as I‚Äôve experienced that as well as living at a campground.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to pray. Pray to God and thank him for all you have now including that job and try to look at the situation with the glass half full. Joining a gym and working out can also help you to take showers and to give you those much needed endorphins.   Just remember everything in life is temporary. Good or Bad. You are being tested and depending on your attitude will ultimately determine how far you will go.   Good luck to you and your Mom and please DM if you need a listening ear. Most people don‚Äôt really need advice and already know what they need to do and some do and others don‚Äôt.   Godspeed.üôèüèΩ
zz08a3,j2ao93z,,Why not swallow some pride and ask a coworker if you can stay with them for a very short period until you get a car and a little money for a spot saved up. Youre talking maybe a month if you continue to save. Either that or you approach the landlord and ask to take over the lease yet still hold your mother accountable for the back rent. Then its your shack and you control the show.
zz08a3,,j2assft,I‚Äôm too embarrassed to ask a coworker and I already hear them complaining about problems with their family. Also, the house we‚Äôre living in now my grandma ‚Äúgave‚Äù it to her so the landlord is just done with our family. My grandma was always late on the rent too.
zz08a3,,j2az44p,Do you work in a good sized facility? If so and there's a bulletin board in the breakroom/s you could post for a ride share. Pay for their gas or offer a flat rate per day. Someone working your shift might be grateful for the extra money. This arrangement would be beneficial to both parties so there would be no reason for you to be embarassed.
zz08a3,,j2bilgz,Thats not dumb at all. At least the  you have some degree of certainty they wont be a weirdo. Or too much of a weirdo anyway.
zz08a3,,j2efogq,It may be very embarrassing to ask for help but consider that you'd be supplementing their income by renting a space from them briefly til you can get your own place. Or they might have a family member that is looking for a full time roommate.   Once your butt is on the cold concrete will no walls to feel safe behind and the rain soaks you to the bone it will be way worse than a embarrassing moment that you could use to safe your self years of hardship for once you're on your own on the street things can go from bad to worse in no time. For example if you don't keep up a certain level of hygiene you could lose your job and everything falls apart.   Instead of asking people if you can stay with them, ask if they know anyone that has a small space to rent asap as you're in a personal situation. If they have space and are comfortable they will offer without you crossing any lines, otherwise they will tell you they'll get you in contact with someone they know or they'll simply say no.   It's not much different than asking around for apartments that might have a open unit to rent.
zz08a3,,j2biwxt,Yeah i hear ya on that one. I have a complete inability to ask for help. Its a problem. I could be stranded at sea and you could come along on a yacht and id be like "nah im good i think I got this."  3rd generation renter... Yeah you may not have good luck with that one. Lol. Shit.
zz08a3,j2bx6ab,,Not sure if this has been said, but is it possible to work with your landlord and get caught up on your mom's place?
zz08a3,,j2cs05n,First thought too‚Ä¶ better to hold on to something secure than to risk it all
zz08a3,j292q6m,,You could buy an ebike with the money you'd save getting the apartment over the motel. Hopefully used cars get reasonable again.
zz08a3,j2aug5g,,You might be lucky to find a reasonable place on Airbnb during low-season and sometimes they drop 50% off for month stays. Would be your safest and cleanest option and you don't have to deal with the cost of utilities/internet/etc.
zz08a3,j2bt638,,I agree with most commenters that the apartment is better than the hotel. $300/wk for four weeks a month means that living in the hotel would be like paying $1200 per month in rent, which I would assume is unaffordable. I agree with the poster who suggested asking around work or putting up a poster to see if coworkers would like to get help with their gas money by driving you to work. That would be a good deal for both parties and something totally reasonable that many people would be willing to do.  &#x200B;  For long-term income for your mom, I suggest reaching out to an SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery (SOAR) provider in your state. (You can find the contact info for your area here: [https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/state-directory](https://soarworks.samhsa.gov/state-directory) ) It's a program designed for people who are experiencing homeless/at risk of homelessness and have a serious mental health condition (like your mom's schizophrenia). If your mom agrees, they would do all the work to submit an application for federal disability benefits (SSI/SSDI) for her. Even if she's applied before and been denied, she has a much MUCH better chance of being approved for SSI/SSDI with SOAR help than without. I'm currently doing the training to provide SOAR help to people in my state and the training says that the approval rate on initial application for people with SOAR help is 68%, versus a 30% general approval rate in 2019.
zz08a3,j2cp2nf,,I‚Äôm so sorry you have to be alone on your birthday, especially your 21st. I know how it feels to be abandoned on your birthday, so I completely empathize with you üôè
zz08a3,j299fe4,,I think your best option is to get that cheap apartment for now. Even if you have to pay transportation extra. I think you mentioned you will live alone. I believe you need to get away from your mother, she is toxic and will bring you down. You need to clear your head and reorganize your life. Once you are in your new place keep searching for better place. Good luck to you.
zz08a3,j29ug5k,,Are you going to live with your mom if you get that apartment? I‚Äôm confused by people on this thread very quick to discard a mom, a very sick mom no less. I think family is what keeps you from being homeless. How did she manage to keep you housed and fed for 21 years and all of a sudden she‚Äôs jobless and penniless? We‚Äôre missing the full story, but I believe in sticking with family, with the exception of physical and sexual abuse and major drug abuse. Schizophrenia is a beast, but it is truly a mental health condition that can be helped with professional help and medication. Living alone in a sketchy area is probably more dangerous than with a family member.   Other people have made great suggestions already. No hotel, yes apartment, yes food banks.
zz08a3,,j2a157o,I tried to get my mother help but It‚Äôs such a long process. Got her sent to a psych ward and they sent her back home. And she relied of government assistance but It‚Äôs all to an end.
zz08a3,j2al2er,,Facebook marketplace - rentals - rooms for rent. Some accept two people in one room, or each to pay for a single room. Prices range from $500 - $1000 a month depending on your location. It is much more affordable than a regular rental, and there is still a contract and everything so you are protected if anything happens. You can move in a place as soon as the same week, depending ofc. But there‚Äôs usually plenty of options and all you need to have is first months rent and maybe a security deposit. You need to have a job and a way to make it to that job (Uber, bus, friend gives you a ride, etc).
zz08a3,j2aokhg,,Maybe get a motorcycle for transportation. Winter time can be fun but aside from that i have a god damn blast riding all year.
zz08a3,j2axbtl,,Depending on if it's ground floor or not you can pick up a cheap scooter as long as it is what they consider a 50cc or smaller you won't need a driver's license for it.

zz08a3,,j2edzky,When facing homelessness it's not the wisest solution to take on more financial responsibility especially something that expensive.
zz08a3,,j2efl6d,You are missing the point. The car can provide shelter and transportation. Which is going to eat all her money .
zz08a3,,j2eh53w,I'm not missing the point. A car will eat up all her money. Gas, insurance, maintenance, licensing, tagging. Cars are a big purchase and come with weekly and monthly costs.   If she already had a car sure, use it. But if you're facing being homeless buying a car is a terrible idea. The money she would sink into gas and insurance monthly she could be saving up for a place or using for food. Plus with being on the verge of homelessness she clearly wouldn't have the funds to buy a reliable car so it would more than likely break down on her often and she would have to pay for a tow and parts or get fined for it being stuck someplace.   Transportation in a city using the public bus is way cheaper than a car. In the Midwest it's 1.50 a trip or 17 dollars a month if you get a pass. Way cheaper than gas and/or insurance plus maintenance costs weekly/monthly.   As for shelter she has a job in the medical field so she needs to stay cleaner than most so she needs somewhere to bathe regularly or else she would lose her job and be even worse off. Sure she could bathe at truck stops for a couple dollars but all in all she's better off just saving her money and finding a roof.   That's what I did.
zz08a3,,j2ehnll,Confused. She talks about staying in a hotel and paying for Uber. Maybe you need to educate her on the public Transportation. She must not be aware of it. OR it‚Äôs not an option . So for you to dismiss my argument and speak about public transportation. It‚Äôs not even an option I bet. And the car. You can find one for 1000 and they have minimal upkeep. You are being very negative regarding the vehicle. I‚Äôve owned them for 40 years. Some are easy to fix. And a better solution than Uber and hotels
zz08a3,,j2elsao,I see your point and the only reason I disagree is strictly due to the timing. I believe I've seen her dismiss buying a vehicle a few times in the comments. Agreed, Uber and hotels are ridiculously expensive and you'll lose your ass trying to keep up with costs from just one or the other much less both at the same time.
zz08a3,,j2em2w5,Yes! And I do get your point. Absolutely . Good day to you!!
zz08a3,j2cb0j9,,Rent the apt...  You need stability right now, as much as you can manage.  Keep your head down and save.  Keep your money in the bank and not in cash on you or in the apartment.    I would look at opportunities to move up to either an activities position or go to nursing school.
zz08a3,j2edqhq,,Put out an ad looking to bunk with a female roommate on social media. Fb, Craigslist the more the better to get a faster response.    Let it be known you're fully employed, clean, drama free, you're seeking either a place with a female roommate for 3 months so you can save up enough to get your own apartment or willing to go in on a suitable place with someone.    While the ads are out and you're waiting call around to local places and check local resources some cities have programs that will help cover people just before they hit rock bottom.   Talk to coworkers and see if anyone has a spare room they will rent you for a couple months so you can get the cash to get your own place. More than once I've renting a spare room from a coworker. Hell while desperate I even rented a shed, a large closet, and even a attic crawl space. A secure place may not be perfect or ideal but it will keep you safe and you can rest so you don't lose your job.   Get to know public transportation, primarily the bus system if your area has one. It's way cheaper than cabs, Uber, and lyft. There is usually monthly pass you can buy that will be cheaper than daily paying for each ride.   Get a storage unit and put all your stuff in it besides a couple of bags of necessities so you don't have to worry about your things until you find a place you'll for sure settle.  Offer someone 20 to 50 bucks with a truck and they'll usually be willing to drive a load of your stuff somewhere requested within the city limits from my experience.    Best luck. Being homeless is like sticky mud, it's easier to get out of it before you're fully in it.
zz08a3,j2ofmjq,,Pay for an apartment, and forgo being able to go to the grocery store if you have to. Do some research on public transportation, and see if riding the bus (or similar) will save you some money on your commute.  Get in contact with homeless services to find out where the food banks are, and access them. Find out if there are any local churches who give food to people in your situation.  It is better to have four walls, a locked door, and a bathroom then to have food and be exposed to the trauma of the street.  Even a few months on the street could yield enough violent, traumatic experiences that could ruin the rest of your life. Do not expose yourself to homelessness if you can help it.
zz08a3,j2b6nv1,,Ok, so, you're a nurse. Let people in that sketchy neighborhood know you're a nurse. Human nature tends to stop most asshats from messing w nurses and medics.  Get a dog. Get a gun. Get mace. Get a mace. Start practicing Tai Chi because learning Wing Chun on your own will be easier that way, if you can't afford lessons.   Let everyone in your shady neighborhood know you're practicing the ways of the Shaolin Temple, just keep it simple.   Talk about how awesome the Five Finger Death Punch from Kill Bill is.   Don't forget to get to know every cop you come across and let them know what neighborhood you live in. Mostly males cops. Play on that 'hero' image male cops cultivate of themselves.  Not only will they be a presence in your neighborhood, if someone should act stupid around you, your neighbors will be just as likely to shush them as the cops will be to arrest them.
zyzkdg,j28tahe,,I spent a winter in my car up in Wisconsin. At first I was running my car but as you can imagine, the gas added up and the wear and tear isn‚Äôt good. I invested in a 0 degree sleeping bag which worked well. I got lucky and found a high quality sleeping bag at goodwill for 5 bucks. For the really cold nights, I bought a Mr Buddy propane heater. I highly recommend it because it has a low oxygen shut off and it will also shut off if it tips over. Get reflective sun shields for your front and rear windows. Go to the dollar store and get the project cardboard displays. Cut them to fit your door windows and use spray adhesive to add reflective sun shields on one side. Put those in your windows at night. It helps with the cold, keeps the car dark and gives you some privacy. Hope this helps.
zyzkdg,,j2b6brj,This is good advice  Excuse me while I take notes
zyzkdg,,j2d0h5x,Add to the zero degree sleeping back some body hugging wicking clothes. The temperature change can lead to occasional sweating in your sleeping bag, which will bring you you right back down to freezing.

zyzkdg,j29plgw,,My advice to anyone that is planning on car living is if at all possible trade your car for a reliable van, it will be easier for you to set up a warm living space in a van versus a car. I had all three roommates moving back to their respective home States and would not be resigning their portions of the lease.   I had two vehicles. I traded one for an older conversion van and stayed in it for approximately three months, I could not have imagined sleeping in a car for that long. I picked up a twin mattress a good wool blanket and a sub zero sleeping bag along with a couple pillows and I never really got cold, a good sleeping bag is the key
zyzkdg,,j2bo51f,The problem with getting a van is that van living is quite popular now. The prices have gone through the roof pushing prices past what people can afford.

zyzkdg,j2ak56b,,Heat travels upward.  But most cars have little or no insulation on the roof.  Often it is a cloth liner next to sheet metal.  Sometimes there is a lttle padding  So most cars lose lots of heat through the roof.  People insulate the windows because it is obvious, but often they forget about the roof.  Look for sheet styrofoam.  About 3/4 inch thickness is best.  ( The best source of free sheet syrofoam is the dumpster behind a new furniture store )  Place a sheet of it against the roof.  With a sharp knife and a little patience, you can make it fit.  Often there are things to support the edges, like handles or coat racks - so that you can force it in up against the curve of the roof once and it stays there.

If you have the money by what's called fun fur or faux fur. It's expensive but it's thick. This way you can hang this around the windows in your car to keep the cold out and the warmth in. You can also use blankets, towels or even cardboard. Make sure to leave a tiny little crack in the window for air circulation.   Buy thick warm blankets. Or if you have the money, buy a 0¬∞ sleeping bag. They're expensive. Some homeless agencies will provide wool blankets. Not pretty but useful.

zyzkdg,j2a5fpk,,I lived in my car one winter.  I had 3 blankets and I cocooned myself in them.  It only took a couple of minutes to get warm.  I'd imagine sleeping bags would do a better job of trapping the heat in, but I was working with what I had at the time.  So maybe try to get your hands on some sleeping bags and layer them.   They will trap in the heat that your body makes.  I wasn't working then, so during the day I'd go to coffee shops, restaurants, libraries, etc to stay warm and charge my laptop/phone.  Also made friends with someone at the gas station so I had a 24/7 bathroom to use.  They threw out their old donuts at 3am and they just gave them to me.  I would park outside a medical office building so I had wifi.  Prepare to be asked to move along by police or security.  Don't take offense just apologize and go somewhere else. Try to park away from other vehicles.  Don't look suspicious.  I have severe anxiety and it gave me comfort to know that I could survive without all the comforts I was used to, and even now it gives me a little bit of confidence.

zyzkdg,j2ca8gg,,Don't get a buddy heater without a carbon monoxide alarm, or you very well might die.     Get a portable battery like a Jackery to power an electric heating pad for inside your sleeping bag or an electric jacket.      At one point I made plastic cutouts for my windows that I glued black fabric on the outside and reflectix and wool blanket for the inside. They were rigid enough to stay in the windows on their own, but really helped with insulation. I never did try putting insulation in the doors, but I bet it would really help.      Find somewhere to park out of the wind, even near a wall would be helpful. Get plastic water bottles and paint them black, put them inside your windows full of water, in direct sunlight. The water will retain heat from the sun for hours after dark.      Get a prius, they have a very efficient heat pump and the car can be made so that it turns itself on every now and then just long enough to recharge the batteries then shuts the car off again.     Get serious about your layers. Wool under layers are amazing. Gloves, hats, wool socks, etc. You put enough clothes on and you'll be fine as long as you are out of the wind and rain like in a car.     Get a heated mug. If all your liquid intake is nice and hot that will make it much easier to stay warm, while also keeping you hydrated.     Get a cover for your car, put a big blanket under the cover even.     Find an outlet you can park next to and run a small discreet extension cable into the car to power a space heater.     Get a generator and mount it on the back hitch.      Find a heated garage to park in.     Get a fluffy dog to cuddle with.  Park somewhere that you can have a fire. Heat water before bed for warm bottles of water in your sleeping bag.

zyuc19,j28gm73,,Not sure if this will help but.. if that situation with your son not getting disability happened here in Australia, you are able to get in contact with the Minister of the NDIS (disability funding system in Australia).   This would then ensure that your son‚Äôs case was reviewed again and fast.  Is there anything similar in your country where you can appeal to a much higher ranking official of the government?
zyuc19,,j2ae5li,Not a clue. At least part of the payments are left up to the states themselves and my previous state this happened a lot with no recourse. One person we know who had similar happen moved to another state and there was no change in it, and they were still told the back pay was the reason. That and they would be owed more based upon there income when able to work, since they‚Äôd been a chiropractor.   I myself was approved after being assessed as an adult and then it got switched with them claiming to have lost the paperwork, X-rays etc and then railroading it away. I spoke to some others and apparently I‚Äôm far from the only person that happened to.
zyuc19,,j6a1689,I just realized this was more about kiddo.   We have only even begun to even deal with that but we wouldn‚Äôt be using that for this anyway. That would be for kiddo‚Äôs care and things kiddo needs to learn to deal and have needs met we miss out on other stuff to care for. Not for me to be able to move us across the flipping country and try to replace stuff we‚Äôve lost(are going to lose in this process though we are going to try to keep at least this one thing kiddo is very attached to: we have to give up mine though, to even try, which I‚Äôve accepted though it‚Äôs going to be extra difficult for me- I‚Äôm an adult so I have more methods to cope and it‚Äôs not as if it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been screwed over in life and has to cope with extra crap on top of the crap I already deal with- kids are kids though, and kids with extra stuff are kids with extra stuff and I‚Äôm trying to keep something stable in all this hellstorm of a situation none of us asked for or wanted). Or obtain stuff specific to help kiddo. Stuff like devices that help develop skills kiddo will need associated with disability and help with cloths that don‚Äôt irritate kiddo‚Äôs sensitivities etc. I‚Äôd never exploit kiddo the way I was exploited. Not even a little bit.  This said- I‚Äôve had some good suggestions in the comments mixed with some other stuff and I‚Äôm looking into it as can, between handling everything else while better half is at work.
zyuc19,j28h0sr,,Does your other half work? You can apply for low income housing but the wait is months or years. You should have mutually ended your tenancy instead of getting evicted. At least you have a basement to live in now but you have to have a steady income.  Can you find work with a non profit like goodwill ? They hire disabled people
zyuc19,,j2aaqn0,These are great ideas.
zyuc19,,j2ahlkj,We did mutually end tenancy, however in the state I was in if it goes to court they don‚Äôt make that judgement based on if you need it to get out. The judgement was made because the process was being streamlined because hundreds of thousands of people besides us were also facing the process. Many hadn‚Äôt even gotten a notice beforehand. They use it as a tool to shame you for being behind, which I hadn‚Äôt even been aware of at the time because better half was handling the rent still from when I‚Äôd had some health complications. That particular landlord admitted he put us in that position on purpose to try and force us to qualify for rental assistance. He bragged about getting other tenants on it.   Thanks for the judgement though. It doesn‚Äôt help.   Partner has a job, and has had a job this entire time. We won‚Äôt have that basement in a month or so.   Would appreciate keeping advice to the situation rather than commentary on the eviction, which considering the landlord refused to communicate like a grown ass adult ahead of time, is a touchy subject as a rule. I found out we were behind by the notice. The supposed certified version never arrived and no attempt to deliver was even made(a common issue where we lived at the time). So finding out that way was‚Ä¶ bad. That landlord thought having the eviction would help him get money from gov programs and didn‚Äôt connect that to any harm to us besides. In his mind his actions were harmless and as I‚Äôd never had an eviction before I‚Äôd never known just how bad and how hard it would be, and considering the landlord lied and i found out days before we were going to court this was even a thing and spent half that time trying to get what info I could through landlord being incorporative and partner having a fucking nervous breakdown with blood pressure sky high and himself being in no fit state to handle any of it‚Ä¶ I worked with the information I had at the time. Your judgement on that one is unwelcome. r/legaladvice was already markedly unhelpful and perhaps had some given legit advice instead of taking the opportunity to rage at us for some perceived slight, often as if they didn‚Äôt understand how it worked in the first place themselves in practice, maybe I‚Äôd not have taken the advice of someone who supposedly talked to a lawyer. Given our landlord had already lied before, that was why it was advised to obtain the judgement.   The same person also advises ‚Äòmake them sue you‚Äô. However if we had the money the ex landlord would already have it. He raised the rent while I was in the hospital and such, with an unexpected medical issue in the first place, so I actually had no say. Not that I would have in the first place since he cut me out and refused to talk to me because boobs and I told him no, which was all it took. He preyed on my partner. It was predatory af, and he actively didn‚Äôt fix stuff like he should have. We spent nearly our entire lease in year two without a dishwasher. That was when we were verifiably on time with rent too. We rented from that person first as a property manager and then as the owner of a property and we‚Äôd always been good tenants who paid before he pulled the crap where he raised it specifically after asking to see better halves pay stubs under the promise of lowering the rent. I have him on recording admitting he put us in that position on purpose to extort government funds from programs meant to help people struggling during covid. The program we got accepted to ran out of funding before they even got to us and when they forwarded us they didn‚Äôt forward the documents and the next one denied us because we couldn‚Äôt get new documents, as some were lost in the hastiness of the move, and we now live in another state and nobody will call us back about that particular issue.   So don‚Äôt start with me on this. Whatever judgement you have about it I‚Äôve gotten worse and I didn‚Äôt do shit to make that or even know about it. The landlord even admitted he knew the situation was harming my partner but still refused to speak to myself about it like the sexist asshole he is. The last person you should be critiquing on that particular issue is myself and I won‚Äôt stand for it towards partner. He feels more responsible than he even really is. He has his own disability and the landlord took clear advantage of him and of the trust that was once between them. Bastard saw dollar signs and went money mad.   There is nothing I myself could have done to avoid the situation, and we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to leave sooner than we did as without a car we relied on others who were able to drive and help us get out in the first place.   I do not need your retroactive judgement about the eviction and this is not helpful.
zyuc19,,j2ajubf,I would also like to add that if I had a dime for every time I heard some place should hire me purely because ‚Äòthey hire disabled people‚Äô with no thought to if even openings were where I live or lived at the time or how many disabled people exist and work as a rule‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd not need to write a post or need help ever because I‚Äôd be rich enough to buy a house outright. The world doesn‚Äôt work that way and goodwill doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äòoh your disabled? Well shit your hired!‚Äô Nothing works that way. Besides. I have both cptsd and physical disabilities. There are even fewer options even with goodwill. They can‚Äôt put me to work stocking etc and too many people don‚Äôt like to hear not to come up behind people(out of all the things I‚Äôve run into issues for that singular‚Äòaccommodation‚Äô is both the most disrespected and the most discriminated for. I‚Äôve even run into where they won‚Äôt do it otherwise but pointedly do it to me and the try to justify it as ‚Äòhelping‚Äô. Nope. Not helping. Quite the opposite. Then, because of lack of education about ptsd as a rule, they get so very surprised when having my body go through that trauma reaction even if I don‚Äôt physically lash out, has me sick- because as part of a trauma reaction your body shuts down the immune system temporarily so I get to be exposed to crap while my immune system goes down temporarily but it doesn‚Äôt magically erase whatever got in during that time when it comes back up ya know? So no. Goodwill is not a magical fix and because they are the one ‚Äòeveryone knows‚Äô spots fill up fast in the first place. Not every position is reserved for disabled people either and some of it is even exploitive in practice when it is, but I suppose I‚Äôm not supposed to have feelings about that either)  I hear this one a lot, usually from people who have no idea about any of this, but I‚Äôve had people tell me I should be grateful even for places that pay less than min wage ‚Äòbecause disabled people‚Äô and because they know many don‚Äôt have another option so the systematically violate there rights with impunity. I‚Äôm able to speak up about it to some extent but not everyone can. Some people, particularly with intellectual disabilities, often do not even understand they are being taken advantage of and when they do they don‚Äôt see another option.   I bristle anytime I am directed to anything that ‚Äòhires disabled people‚Äô. Those are almost always temp jobs framed as ‚Äòjob training‚Äô and the abuse that happens in such ‚Äòprograms‚Äô is rampant. It is not rare. It is common. There are people who can feel they are even doing people favors while actively abusing them.   I thought perhaps it was the state I‚Äôd lived in but even here in utah I‚Äôve heard from others and even on Reddit, the only place I know that does that specifically, has those same problems and then some. Less than min wage and not actually treated like a person while they pay themselves on the back for even deigning you the ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô to receive said exploitation.   I don‚Äôt trust anything that seeks to hire disabled people and that‚Äôs not even considering a lot of programs won‚Äôt touch me because I‚Äôm considered both smi due to having ptsd, which qualifies as smi, and physically disabled. I‚Äôve been told ‚Äòapply for social security‚Äô. ‚ÄòThey turned me down‚Äô. ‚ÄòDo it again‚Äô. At this point I consent to apply for social security to shut people up because it comes up regularly because of how disabled I am.   How dare I function in family life though. That must mean I can work too right? I‚Äôve run into countless(a lot more than I would ever care to even try to count at any rate so maybe I cannot say literally countless if I‚Äôm not even trying- it‚Äôs a common mindset though) situations like that. I have enough to deal with.   The hardest thing about being disabled is dealing with what other people think and project about it at you or about you using it and what others think of it, no matter how wrong they are.   In this case however, I hate that I‚Äôve been desperate enough to apply to places even knowing working at all destroys my health. The last time I worked a job that wasn‚Äôt work from home I was sick for months afterwards because immune system go boom plus call center where people come in sick as a rule or lose there jobs, regardless what management claims, had me sick for months and it even threw off another health issue that effects other things and effected my ability to work.   Like damn. Just because I am applying doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm applying to destroy myself for a temporary paycheck. I am consciously aware. People do all sorts of desperate things when backed into corners though and I‚Äôm very aware we need help and if it kills me I will find a way, and that is where it is. ‚ÄòEven if it kills me‚Äô. So please don‚Äôt take that as some statement that I‚Äôm somehow less disabled. I‚Äôve been turned down from programs meant to help with training and even voc rehab, because they ‚Äòreviewed‚Äô and decided I‚Äôm not worth it and am ‚Äòtoo disabled‚Äô. You know what THAT feels like? It‚Äôs frustrating. Beyond frustrating. It‚Äôs being told ‚Äòyou are too disabled to have dreams‚Äô. I wanted to become a lawyer and wanted to become a paralegal before that to help build the connections etc. I was told I wasn‚Äôt worth a paralegal program because I am permanently disabled multiple ways and will always struggle in those ways. Yet according to social security the list of jobs I can do is the same as the list of jobs I cannot do.   I could do paralegal, especially if on a part time basis, if I could get the program, but then most things I could do that with require something I‚Äôve been deemed ‚Äòtoo disabled to be worth‚Äô.   I will never be okay with how flippantly people toss ‚Äòjust apply to this place. They hire disabled people‚Äô or the judgement that happens when you have and they have decided you are too disabled or they don‚Äôt have enough spots for you etc. Id ask that people look up places and what it‚Äôs actually like before doing so but in general that seems too much to ask the way people often act about it.  My apologies if this sounds more emotional than I mean it to.  None of that would help within the next month or so even if I could be accepted by it. I‚Äôm aware wait lists can be long. Very much so. They are still hope the situation can change for the better eventually. So yes. Those would be more helpful than your comment.
zyuc19,,j2okncg,Don't apologize for being emotional. The process that you're going through is traumatic.  Do you have any relationship whatsoever to the LDS church?
zyuc19,,j2wk9sn,I am unsure what to say. My apologies.   Does knowing someone in it count?
zyuc19,,j2yct1m,Depending on your situation, sometimes they can be of assistance. It may be worth contacting the local bishop to inquire if they can be of any aid.  The person you know, if she lives nearby, might be of help.
zyuc19,,j2yy0x4,I‚Äôve heard about that but the person we were staying with liked to talk crap instead of face there emotions, so it‚Äôs less complicated to avoid making whatever lies told, claiming good intentions even while clearly not, and she already admitted to having lied to her bishop about us outright. Considering she really only told me things that were likely to come out in even casual conversation with the clear intention of basically trying to get me to go along with it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs not more work to get a stranger to understand the situation to even begin to try to help if someone has already bullshat them to make themselves look good or there husband less of a problem with his yelling at the drop of a fucking hat and about the stupidest crap. I caught her on accident once so I even have a slight idea the nature of the lies told she may not have deemed far enough to need to divulge.   Honestly I was about to update since our situation changed.   Our other problems aren‚Äôt solved but we‚Äôre renting from a very nice lady now. She‚Äôs quite kind and also quiet. I‚Äôm fairly sure she thinks she is louder than she is but the most noise she makes is taking her four legged family member out to potty and obviously that isn‚Äôt anything we‚Äôd have a problem with.   Mostly I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what to do next to try to get our situation to where we need it to be, but the calm here helps a lot. No more screaming overhead.   I have no idea if the bishop here is the same though and if they are I‚Äôd still feel more comfortable talking to one I don‚Äôt have to worry about what other lies the person whose basement we were in told besides those she admitted to me about. It‚Äôs exhausting to even think about and I don‚Äôt have the emotional energy to even begin to approach it at this point. She lied to so many people and even trash talked us to someone we both know! It never crossed my mind she was doing that until I caught her and heard it from her own mouth. It wasn‚Äôt even true! I‚Äôd have at least understood if she was venting but the only thing being vented was negative emotions! Not the honest truth! She was directing her negative emotions from her husband or the kids fighting etc on me as well, because it was easy. I spent 99% of my time basically trapped in her basement since I‚Äôm disabled and couldn‚Äôt get out without help in the first place, and even with help it was difficult to do(not always reasonable either), and‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs not like I was interacting with a lot of people to be able to correct anything or any narratives she wove. She even trash talked me to her kids, which we only found out because one of her kids told ours! Told him there mom told them those things in the first place! So there perceptions were colored by there parents. There dad had weaponized them as well, to push us into not coming out and using the kitchen while they were home despite the fact we couldn‚Äôt do so all the time in the first place because I do the cooking in the first place and he didn‚Äôt want cooking happening no matter how safe, so he‚Äôd make both options hostile but upstairs he‚Äôd use there kids to do it.   Honestly our situation is still ‚Äòthere is a lot to process‚Äô but we have the space to at least begin doing so.   Our landlady is, so far, very kind.   Our other issues aren‚Äôt solved but having a place to land goes a long way in of itself. Obviously not having that compounds everything. Especially when people use ‚Äòthis is temporary‚Äô to justify crap that they even know isn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be.   We‚Äôll still be humane and honor agreements with the people we stayed with but I‚Äôm of the mind I‚Äôll tackle the whole ‚Äòcan we even still be friends from my end?‚Äô After the dust settles and we‚Äôve got all our stuff out(we are working on that currently so technically still in the process of moving).   I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ever going to have the energy to deal with someone else‚Äôs narrative targeting, especially considering my history with that growing up and how someone else took advantage of that before. Sure it‚Äôs been some years since that happened but, hard as my trust is to earn this person both earned it before and has now shattered it, and that is enough to deal with without the added complications of people who both don‚Äôt know me and also who have been lied to about me.   I‚Äôm not even sure, at least at this point, if we are even in the same ‚Äòward‚Äô(they call them wards but it‚Äôs a set area each bishop is assigned to). We aren‚Äôt all that far away but still far enough it may be a different bishop and I‚Äôve no idea how to go about finding that out at all. All I know is I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable having to go to one I already know miss gossip has already lied about me and parts of our situation to but also went into detail about parts of our situation that would sound bad and she knew would sound bad without the context given to them, which she did not and none of it was okay in the first place(if she really wanted to help us or for her bishop to do so she should have set up a meeting instead of taken the opportunity to trash us to him).   Anyway, I don‚Äôt know how to figure out who the bishop is for an area. I have no idea what ‚Äòward‚Äô we are in.  Edit for clarity: that‚Äôs whose basement we were in. So‚Ä¶ yeah.
zyuc19,,j2zc3q2,I see.   Here's the website for the meeting house locator: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/maps/meetinghouses/  From there you can get contact information for your local bishop. Since you have a place to live, they will likely give you a food donation if you ask for one.
zyuc19,j2z09ol,,UPDATE(if possible can a mod please pin this comment?): We have found a place with a private renter. We are currently waiting for the written agreement to make things more cemented, however we are warm, safe, and it‚Äôs a lot quieter here. Anything here is quite reasonable. So no screaming above our heads or loud arguments etc.   The person we are renting from now, has been kind to us. I am still cleaning the place up, since she‚Äôd not been able to with her job after the last person who rented here left(we knew that beforehand and agreed to do it) but it‚Äôs coming along. Even our esa are happier here. Our current landlady is even patient with kiddo, who has even helped shovel snow and was just happy to help!   Our landlady is a quiet and kind person. The most noise she makes is taking her pet outside to potty and that‚Äôs nothing we have any issue with at all. No yelling, no screaming. It‚Äôs mostly peaceful! Plus no constant on guard for some new edict!   Thank you everyone for advice.   Could still use some advice for how to find a place that does loans with bad or no credit(so we can obtain a vehicle) but as far as being homeless or in danger of it, it looks like one very nice private landlady helped us avoid that outcome. I‚Äôm aware this doesn‚Äôt always happen though, and am grateful it did for us.   For awhile we‚Äôll be in a place where, financially, we‚Äôre still one wrong thing away from it, but we‚Äôre in a better position than we were. We are safe and warm and I‚Äôm thinking of baking something nice for our new landlady in thanks.   Thank you everyone who gave awesome advice and encouragement.

zxwgfp,j232io1,,Concerning struggling, psych meds, adulting tasks, advocating for yourself, past trauma, socializing:  Being honest‚Ä¶I‚Äôm 38 and still working on all these things‚Ä¶just, likely in different areas/ways.  In my case‚Ä¶I‚Äôm actually pretty lucky overall.   While many factors have made things difficult in my life‚Ä¶I was fortunate to have a long term job stability, which unfortunately has now ended, but that‚Äôs another matter for another day.  Point is. One step at a time.  Consider a plan‚Ä¶I.E. a manageable job for the time being‚Ä¶ask others for input‚Ä¶give yourself a breather.,.put the plan together‚Ä¶then be proactive with it.  Once you get a job and get settled in‚Ä¶you‚Äôll feel more stable for sure. Then if you‚Äôre thinking about a second job, nothing like applying for job #2, when you‚Äôve already got job #1‚Ä¶you tend to not be as desperate and negotiate wages better.  Medical advocacy: always best to keep a diary of your symptoms and who you speak with medically.  Also, I‚Äôd advise not to go alone to appointments if possible. Even as a middle aged adult male I‚Äôve been misdiagnosed, overprescribed, mislabeled and told I said things that I know for certain was not the case‚Ä¶because I kept records of each appointment and also my advocate was with me and was surprised to hear the doctor not listening to me, but then also claiming I had stated differently‚Ä¶so I pull my advocate into the conversation‚Ä¶and well the doctor doubled down and I ended up finding a new doctor the end.  It‚Äôs easy to get emotions tied into things.  I look at it this way‚Ä¶I learned some helpful information by going to that doctor and in some ways he was not a good, possessive you might say, but‚Ä¶it helped me learn how to improve my advocacy and also be a better patient.  Now I‚Äôve been with a new physician and am learning even more helpful things and this is just within the last year.  So, you‚Äôve got some time I think. Just got to get started somewhere and some momentum going.  Stabilizing is a must and that‚Äôs done one step at a time.

No one belived me, and even after evidence (seperate to anything related to what I went through) ended up with that psychiatrist losing her FAKE lisence, every doctors office that I have seemed to go to, whether physical or mental have been an absolute nightmare. I was in a psych hospital a few months ago, told them that being over medicated almost killed me and that it gave me a tic disorder and if the tic disorder would have gotten worse I wouldnt have been able to make it out of my abusive home, let alone survive. They proceeded to medicate me anyway and call me a liar. I kept telling them to look at the news artical about the psychiatrist but they wouldnt listen. They would have rather stayed in their own little fantasy of them always being right. Whats worse is that most of the people I try to talk to it about cant rationalize it and try to blame me for everything that happened. The people i am living with know that I struggle with severe depression and keep telling me to get help because they dont belive me either. They belive me, but cant rationalize it entirely I guess. Im sorry for the trauma dump, I'm just in a lot of pain right now.   Thank you for the advice though, its quite comforting knowing that someone relates rather than someone blasting "toughen up, suck it up, get over it, thats not possible."  So, anyways, your words mean a lot, thank you
zxwgfp,,j24rqz6,Yes‚Ä¶This World will drive/push honest and caring people over the edge.  What I found most concerning in my Healthcare is that‚Ä¶after leaving one Physician for ‚Äúpill pushing‚Äù I came across other nurses who worked not under that same Doctor, but another‚Ä¶And were Very Aware of This.   After having experienced the pains and still suffering from lingering side effects of being prescribed medications that were no doubt unnecessary and causing harm‚Ä¶later backed by a Specialist‚Äôs medical opinion, I am in aww at all the health, time and energy I lost.   It was so much stress. It still is.  Trauma dump‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a neat term and hey, it wouldn‚Äôt exist if there wasn‚Äôt a need for it.   Look at things this way‚Ä¶I‚Äôm 38, worked for 17 years at the same place, did military service and deployment, obtained a Bachelor‚Äôs in Education (after like a decade).  Other stories I‚Äôve read‚Ä¶Attorneys, RN‚Äôs and others in healthcare, many others across different fields in the US‚Ä¶.We Are All Having Similar Struggles With The Healthcare System. Why?  I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like going at it from 18 years old, heck even 25‚Ä¶and trust me 25 is hopefully a lot better!  The hardest thing to do‚Ä¶is learn how to be diplomatic, if you will.  With Psychiatry‚Ä¶I started reading up on History and Structure‚Ä¶current Director and Past Directors of the National Institute of Mental Health.  Picked up Dr. Thomas Insel‚Äôs Audio book, ‚ÄúHealing, Our Path From Mental Illness to Mental Health‚Äù.  It was enlightening to say the least.  Also, brushed up on current State lawsuits against select pharmacies.   So, guess what responses I got from those who where members of my medical in Psychiatry when I asked basic questions relating to what I learned on these points?.  Not talking front desk‚Ä¶I‚Äôm talking who‚Äôs writing me scripts.  They didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶were not aware of any lawsuits with any pharmaceutical companies, had no clue who the current director of the NIMH is, nor any past directors.  I spoke with clinical management‚Ä¶same thing.  This is my experience with the current state of healthcare in the US‚Ä¶it does not appear to be getting better and I am saddened to hear similar stories from many others.  Pro tip: when you‚Äôre asked if you have any questions‚Ä¶seems they aren‚Äôt happy if you actually have questions‚Ä¶why is that?  Anyhow, you have to keep things all written down‚Ä¶especially with how the medications you‚Äôre prescribed will effect you. It will help greatly to have a consistent person with you at medical appointments and have their notes too.  If an issue comes up‚Ä¶take care of it right away and use what documentation you have to advocate.  You Will Not Be Liked By Staff and The Facility for Doing So, but‚Ä¶that‚Äôs just part of it.  Sometimes, it comes to a point where you have to seek care from another facility, find the new one first ( over lap) make sure it‚Äôs a good fit, then discontinue services from previous one.
zxwgfp,j23hjab,,Yes. It took me five years plus but I made it out. I'm going on 17 months now in my place and while I do have health issues and money is very tight sometimes mostly I'm steady and doing better mentally.
zxwgfp,j268er7,,at a certain point insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. For many of us--it essentially just took several stints in psyche wards and sometimes manlingering a bit and exacerbating symptoms to put together a thick chart of diagnosis. I had a friend who feigned severe dis associative identity disorder at 23 to get SSI disability--one she got that--like 1300ish a month she got on the marion county sec 8 wait list and eventually got into a place after 17 months...for $200 something a month she pays in rent..gets food stamps...discount bus pass and subsists on around 1000 a month for food and entertainment...doesn't have to work the rest of her life. It's possible to "retire" early in life if you plan it right if you feel you're truly hopeless
zxwgfp,j27boyn,,Well you're reaching out for advice.  That's a huge step, recognizing you need assistance and going after it.  Stay clean, don't get into drugs.  You can make it work, just don't stop trying.

I never wanted to be in this situation *this* long (now over 2 years). Not to mention I let a man financially and psychologically abuse me at my most vulnerable point and that made it worse. But luck willing I will be out of this by February.
zxwgfp,,j3hvcqq,Im glad that you will be out of this by feburary!! Yeah psychological manipulation can be a duzy- im glad that you made it out!!! Keep going, you got this!
zxwgfp,j22upsp,,Yes. But it took some pain. Before I was homeless, I had an alcohol addiction. After treatment, I lived in a sober living house, until I lost work. I then spent 2 years homeless, living in the Drop In center (DI) in Calgary. After protecting myself from a fight and getting my leg broken, my parents took me in to recover. After my leg was healthy, I started volunteering at a thrift store/charity, then got hired. Then I got lucky, as my parents bought me a small condo. I got lucky (in a way, since my parents wanted me to live a tough life before they gave me security),but now I'll never worry about housing ( I fully own my place). I know that many don't have family that will do such, but... ...that's how I made it out. A broken leg, and wealthy, but generous after certain conditions family.
zxwgfp,,j22uv2e,Thank you, it's definetly the small things that save us

zxvdan,j22qasl,,Six months ago it was the end of June.  Where do you live that was that cold six months ago?
zxvdan,,j240d9j,In the southern hemisphere the summer is cold and the winter is warm. Also in the nordic countries it's cold most of the year
zxvdan,,j24qpjn,Yes, but the question was where does the OP live?    I don't believe Walmart operates in Nordic countries (or NZ or AU.)  https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/walmart-locations-by-country.html  Looking at the OPs posts, I believe s/he lives in the US.
zxvdan,,j24rafy,Canada and Argentina are the only countries that have Walmart and there is cold in the summer. Although only northern Canada and southern Argentina  Edit: I just saw that OP lives in Phoenix so yeah my teory falls apart. Maybe it's cold at night and hot at day? It would make sense given the geographical position of the city
zxvdan,,j26z2w6,Coldest it got in March of 2022 in Phoenix was 48 degrees.
zxvdan,,j27167f,It's not really warm you know? At that temp some people are freezing
zxvdan,,j2qtlan,Especially if they‚Äôve lived in Phoenix their whole life & are malnourished from being food insecure.
zxvdan,,j25rc8v,It certainly doesn't
zxvdan,,j23zupi,My bad, it was March of 22, so okay, 9 months. Time flies when you're having fun.
zxvdan,,j26x494,Here is a record of the temperatures in Phoenix in March of 2022.  The lowest temperature was 48 degrees.  That doesn't sound "painfully cold".  https://world-weather.info/forecast/usa/phoenix/march-2022/
zxvdan,j23pxyb,,I'll take "shit that didn't happen" for $600 Alex.
zxvdan,,j24i1w7,Agree, the ‚Äúf‚Äî him up‚Äù part threw me off. Something tells me the first half of the story was real, but the confrontation was embellished upon a bit
zxvdan,,j24id81,That was my sense too. Especially after post history...
zxvdan,,j254c9d,Yeah, store employees (especially places as big as Walmart) are told NOT to interfere with suspected thieves because of the liability of someone getting hurt.
zxvdan,,j24bs5w,I‚Äôm not so sure. The Walmart in Tucson in the worse parts of town regularly clobbers and beats people up for stealing. I once got accidentally maced by a security guard in the parking lot because it was windy and he was spraying it at a guy running away. There is also a 7-11 near by that beats up attempted been runs assholes. It‚Äôs the old west here and it happens.
zxvdan,,j2lnv03,I‚Äôm sure there are outliers especially with businesses that are mom/pop or a franchise but usually corporate policy for big box stores have rules against approaching people stealing.
zxvdan,,j2loqxy,Or just good ol boys who don‚Äôt follow rules because they like to fight.
zxvdan,,j240x9j,And the answer is...This grizzled satist takes wild stabs in the dark about the accuracy and truthfulness of anonymous postings on Reddit in the hopes he hits something. Never mind the OP has absolutely nothing to gain by fabricating such a story, hasn't asked for any charity, or even an ounce of sympathy, but just sought opinion.  Who is...shit4brains?  BUZZ  No, I'm sorry, Mind4Lease ..Mind4Lease.  Oh...that's what I meant Alex.  Select again....

zxvdan,j26eby6,,Do not believe you.
zxvdan,j2668bg,,If this really did happen, the last place I would go for help is a Reddit forum. I would be busy trying to obtain camera footage of that incident and SU SUE SOOOOOOO
zxvdan,j27aue3,,I'm not sure about this. I know for a fact that a Walmart security officers, and employees, are forbidden from touching you even when you are suspected of shoplifting. They can be sued for assault if they do. They can't even stop you from leaving the property. Their only resort is calling the cops.  If this happened a police report and a likely free injury lawyer could be involved.
zxvdan,j22jjw1,,Have you tried to steal another sleeping bag?
zxvdan,,j22l383,I never tried again, i succeeded all 12 subsequent times.
zxvdan,,j23yfwz,Wtf does this mean dude
zxvdan,,j24hmjg,Do or do not. There is no try.
zxvdan,j22lmgv,,Where are you located?  If this was in fact walmart security (or a company contracted to work with that store) then they could be violating post orders /policy be physically touching you. They can take the item from you, and in SOME places they can detain you but only for a breif time while they wait for law enforcement.   Regardless of any of that, that was plain and simple assult and was completly uncalled for. Espically for such a "cheap" item. So fucked up and I am sorry that happened to you.  Edit to say that sometimes they cant even follow you out of the store to apprehend shoplifters.
zxvdan,j22ocpc,,I‚Äôm sorry man. It‚Äôs fucking pathetic that people think it‚Äôs a moral better to inflict violence on the desperate over letting Walmarts profit margins take a hit.
zxvdan,j234ho4,,IDK where you are, but if you are in the so cal area, cops won't do a thing, maybe take a report and then leave.  Even if they have the vid and all the info, knowing who the jerks are, they still won't do anything.  Only time they act is if it makes onto the local news, it happens to some rich guy or there is a murder.
zxvdan,j232ev6,,Go find a lawyer that will do it for you for free. Sooner better than later.
zxvdan,j233ct1,,Bro sue em if you can
zxvdan,j22tpc0,,Wow,,,so sorry to hear this happened to you and by nevertheless 4 men over a sleeping bag!??  Guess you are lucky you escaped with your life ,  sheer violence by 4 brutes. God bless and prayers for you. Did you ever make it to the ER sounds like like you should have been seen by a Doctor , God knows what injuries you sustained , and you still have eye pain, I'm so sorry they did this to you.
zxvdan,j24mu2a,,Wow, they must have known they went too far on the "fuck him up" bit. It's rare they don't involve the police. I understand desperation. Walmart commits wage theft on the regular. If you think you can pursue legal action go for it. I kind of doubt it myself. Just count your blessings you weren't arrested and move on. It's a fucked up world but it is what it is
zxvdan,j230phk,,Ask for what you need honey there are people how give and share.
zxvdan,,j258ira,I AM BEGGING AND NOTHING
zxvdan,,j24339t,Oh I've tried. My issue with asking for handouts is that people don't even believe I'm destitute much less homeless. I often get mistaken for either an actor or professional athlete. Let me qualify this remark because its relevant. While it sounds like I'm trying to compliment myself, believe me, nothing could be further from the truth.  I'm a very nice person, I give others the shirt off my back if I have one left to give, I'm kind to everyone I meet unless they immediately give me a reason not to be. I'm humble in every way, even in what I now call "real life" (not homeless) when I have nice things and a good job. But, I don't look like a charity case, even after 2 years on the street.  And because I do everything I can to take care of myself, even brushing my teeth with no water under a bridge and washing my face and hair in a utility faucet attached to the side of a warehouse, I do it, and I do it religiously.  When my clothes are dirty I take $2.50 in quarters and wash that shit at the laundromat. It's these simple things that allow me to cope, but its these things that hinder my convincing anyone I'm anything but a scam artist looking to line my pockets a little faster, rather than the actual truth. It's very disheartening.
zxvdan,j23b0yh,,They deserve every ounce of litigiousness you can muster
zxvdan,j241dgk,,Oh yes the occasional HERO (in this case 4 heroes) people that boost know all about this shit. What it really comes down to is bad luck because unfortunately some power hungry ass bandits thought they needed to intervene over someone stealing something.. occasionally people that do that shit and play shoplifting hero for the grocery stores gets shot or stabbed.. pretty risky. Most people I have known that pulled shit like this did it because they were taking out here frustration on someone else. The one guy had found out his wife picked up a couple homeless living under the freeway over pass when she was drunk and had them DP her. Of course he started targeting homeless people and when a homeless shoplifter was leaving a store he almost killed him and went to prison. Sad world
zxvdan,,j245p6u,I thought about this possibility as well. Thank you. But then I thought about these questions:  1. Since when do 4 grown men, all very able bodied, all equally as violent, go shopping together at 9pm on a Sunday night at Walmart, without any family accompanying them, and decide to risk all of their freedom, in front of a parking lot full of people, in full view of 15 cameras, and in view of Walmart security, plus a private security vehicle patrolling the lot, to beat up some random guy that forgot to scan something at self checkout calmly pushing my cart to my would be vehicle (at least that would have been the perception)? It's not like I was running out the front door with a duffel full of electronics.  2. Why did they take the sleeping bag back inside with them and leave the items I paid for with me? How did they know?  3. These guys knew exactly how to restrain me and land blows in coordinated fashion.  4. These were 4 white men all similar in build and look, no tattoos, all dressed conservatively.  They reeked of off duty ex law enforcement to me.
zxvdan,,j24orgd,Smells like crypto.com agents trying to silence you brother
zxvdan,,j24dd10,Walmart has a hard on for homeless people.  They're watching you the second you walk in the store if you are homeless.  And you did the unforgivable.  You boosted from the Sporting Goods section.  That's where all homeless people boost from.  It's the hottest area in the store.  You were asking for it to honest.  You'll get away with stealing food, but not much else.
zxvdan,,j26b22e,Was it your mother that was Dp'd by 2 homeless?
zxvdan,j26gvnc,,Walmart is one of the, if not THE, most litigious corporations.  They don‚Äôt settle.  Did you preserve evidence?  Pictures of your injuries?  Names and addresses of actual witnesses?  I don‚Äôt know who told you that you have a good case, but unless they have a law degree not from the University of Google?  Yeah.  Don‚Äôt take that advice.
zxvdan,j277wrt,,It was random people. You have no case against walmart lol let alone an ‚Äúairtight‚Äù one
zxvdan,j28mtnv,,You are owed money for medical bills. You need to contact a lawyer. Most will do stuff free if your suing and only take a percentage. You don't have to sue for pain and suffering but at least do it for your own wellbeing.
zxvdan,j23leld,,Maybe ask someone to have bought the sleeping bag for you?    I don't think a lawsuit is in order here. But it always works for me, to call the judicator.
zxvdan,,j24h5bl,It‚Äôs hard to ask for help.   The penalty for shoplifting is not aggravated assault. Necessity is only a criminal defense for a greater/equal crime. (Meaning you cannot kill someone to prevent a non-violent low level misdemeanor). So there is also criminal liability for the 4, in addition to the shared civil liability for the store and the four.   In fact commission of a crime does not negate tortuous liability. If you shoot/wound someone breaking into your home; they can still sue you for medical/pain and suffering and often win!!
zxvdan,,j24h826,Also who the heck is the judicator?
zxvdan,j24g3al,,NAL - but I believe you can sue Walmart and unnamed john does. Up to lawyers to argue blame.  It happened on Walmart property and they‚Äôre liable for your safety. Surely they told the men what was taken ha what was paid for; so the employee caused the resulting action from the 4 people.   Also by including the 4 john does - Walmart will be motivated to identify them so they can blame them.
zxvdan,j25ygt3,,Even the pope said its alright to steal from corporations. This is fucked though. People act like they're not closer to being in this situation than not.
zxuwvc,j22nls0,,One of the strangest places I‚Äôve slept was *inside* a freeway overpass. Where I live a lot of the raised overpasses had to undergo seismic retrofitting several decades ago to protect the freeways from earthquakes. In order to put in the improvements, access shafts were made inside the concrete decks below the road surface. In many instances they are too high up to realistically be accessible, but some are low enough that the metal plates over the openings can be removed and you can get in there. I‚Äôve been in several, some are quite large. The one I slept in was tall enough to stand upright in and was divided into sections like rooms.
zxuwvc,,j22x48v,That‚Äôs pretty wild‚Ä¶initially I was imagining a nearly impossible place to get to until fully reading through.  Would love to understand more from an engineering standpoint as to the design, either way pretty cool and neat.  I enjoyed a video not too long ago explaining all matters concerning floor joists.  Inside of an overpass sounds much more impressive. How was the air quality?
zxuwvc,,j231mte,Be careful with that one. Sometimes there are needles
zxuwvc,,j24hvm0,Ohh‚Ä¶well, I suppose in my shape I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry much anyway. Unless there‚Äôs a staircase leading to it‚Ä¶I‚Äôm probably not gonna make it.  There‚Äôs been abandoned schools, colleges, and other buildings‚Ä¶.with the popularity of exploring such places and posting videos online there‚Äôs at least a way I can live vicariously.
zxuwvc,,j27rz81,Open field. I couldn‚Äôt do it now as I‚Äôm hella more physical messed up but I found a field in one of those empty lots with tall grass, houses walled off to two sides and street along the other two sides. Was in a slightly less densely populated area. Also wasn‚Äôt cold af. Plopped down my backpack and stared at the stars. The dark and tall grass helped so people in the light by the road wouldn‚Äôt see me. You learn all sorts of things homeless. Never thought I‚Äôd be facing doing it again‚Ä¶
zxuwvc,j22gnrb,,I live in my car; I sleep at my old job and my old coworkers don‚Äôt mind and I‚Äôm always welcomed. I‚Äôve come to call the parking lot my ‚Äúhome‚Äù.
zxuwvc,,j25rkqn,Car is best homeless
zxuwvc,j22g82q,,My favorite was goodwill donation boxes
zxuwvc,,j22grq6,Hell yea. Severe winter storm coming. I hit that box and got like 10 blankets. Made myself nice little bird nest out in the woods
zxuwvc,,j22ikpm,How did you carry around all those blankets?
zxuwvc,,j22kavr,There was a small wooded area behind salvation army. I laid one blanket open on ground, wadbup the rest and wrap in the first blanket so made a santa bag to carry to woods. Only had to go across parking lot
zxuwvc,,j22hrfw,Sounds cozy!. I used to layer my clothing and when it got super cold, I'd turn into a turtle and "pull" myself into my layers of clothing and stay warm and toasty. Even in the snow.
zxuwvc,,j22jyez,Oh yea. I built a snow cave once. Dig a body size hole in a snowbank and tuck in. Breaks the wind. Hold in the bldy heat. If ya lucky have small fire on the opening side.
zxuwvc,,j22gjbk,Thats a good one!. Never tried that but I did sleep in a newspaper/cardboard recycling bin once. Dangerous and would defo not recommend as this is not a safe place to sleep...at all!.
zxuwvc,,j22hq1d,Just be careful of these, you might be aware but for those who are not here's what to avoid:  https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/homeless-man-probably-crushed-to-death-after-sleeping-in-recycling-container/
zxuwvc,,j22iidv,Yeah, good point!. I've come to realize just how fortunate I was that day. Yikes!.
zxuwvc,,j22j6md,I had no idea about those trucks until recently, glad you avoided them
zxuwvc,j22vvqx,,I've always planned things out and played things overly safe. I always avoided other people sleeping outside out of distrust. Generally, I find out-of-the-way places in a town far from anywhere that gives out any aid so I can peacefully sleep without someone walking up on me. That usually means the outskirts of a town or an undeveloped plot that nobody seems to bother with.   The latest was a patch of city land prone to flooding so it wasn't developed it was a 30-minute hike into the area and it was overgrown to hell and back with loads of wildlife and more bugs than I'd like to remember.   I hiked in and set up camp. Luckily it was so overgrown I was able to have a small fire and set up a camp so I could feel semi-civilized.  Made a tarp teepee, found a mattress topper foam thing I used for a bed, and set up a container to keep a small amount of food submerged a few feet below the water at the water edge so I could have cool milk, meats, and such when I get cash. Cheap, greasy foods tear up my stomach and give me the shits and I prefer to shit in a bag/hole and rarely as necessary.  So I spend most of my money on higher quality meals, but it also helped me make friends.   For a "home-cooked meal" of potatoes, canned mixed veg, and pan-fried pork chops I fed this poor guy strung out on meth walking around in his underwear confused. I invited him to take a seat and have a bite to eat and warm up by the fire. It was 16 degrees F. I was new to the city and needed information so I fed him in return he told me all about areas I wanna avoid, local resources, what certain people looked like that might give me trouble, and what the cops are like, and he agreed and kept his word to steer people away from my campsite. I'd come and go and sometimes he would be wandering around outside my tent but he never touched anything I could tell or took anything that I missed.   I generally carried a 15-inch hip knife and a hiker pack so the cops knew me as a thru-hiker that was visiting for a while. Ed (the guy I fed) laughed one night while I was starting a fire to make us some food. He saw my 15in kukri and said that right there will keep most people away from your camp around here. You're a big guy nice enough but you look like you're pretty strong and add that knife and you could be terrifying. I laughed and said I rather make friends than enemies. If you respect me you're less likely to want to harm me, if you fear me you'll bring friends to overpower me. I feed you because I like people who can hold a good conversation that's a rare trait these days.   Did I trust him? No. Did I enjoy his company? Yes and no, 40/60, he was better than nobody but I knew his addiction made him unpredictable.  So in summary, I generally sleep in the woods or I'll dig a fox hole in the countryside. I really really don't like people coming up on me when I'm asleep. So its worth the extra walk and work for me.  If I'm desperate and can't find a suitable place I'll hope on a public transport bus set my pack between my knees and lean my head back for a power nap for a couple stops.
zxuwvc,,j2950cw,> set up a container to keep a small amount of food submerged a few feet below the water at the water edge so I could have cool milk, meats  Can you tell me a little more about how you did this?
zxuwvc,,j2cdoou,I was walking by a garage sale and saw a wire mesh stringer not a advert just a example [almost exactly like this one](https://www.fishusa.com/eagle-claw-floating-wire-fish-baskets/?sku=108271) for keeping fish in the water after you catch them so they don't spoil. The floater lid on mine was broken so it worked perfectly. I paid the elder couple a couple bucks and got it from them. It worked well because it was flat when not used but I could easily fill it tie a good knot and drop it into deep water off an edge and hide the rope it was tied to anchored to the bank.   I got the idea because growing up in the south we fished a lot and it's extremely hot most the year but the guys would get a cloth bag and put a case in it and tie the bag up and submerge it. The beer always came out ice cold so long as it was a few feet under the water.   Colder you want your food/drink deeper you have to let it sink and set in the water. This differs and depends on the area. A half gal of milk would last a few days before spoiling for example, I usually finished it before it went bad. Lunch meat lasts roughly a week. If you need stuff really cold put a small bag of ice in the stringer with the food in contact but in its own packaging. It's not perfect but it's more or less a environmental cooler.   This doesn't work as well with fast currents unless you can anchor your stringer really well, but I wouldn't trust it.   Zip lock bags, double bagging, regular checking is necessary.  It's worth the trouble honestly. But if thing start going bad it will draw fish even more than normal. Which you'll find out fish and turtles will sometimes help themselves if you don't set up precautions.  I usually line the inside bottom with a few  plastic bottles split and laid flat so turtles don't nibble thru the mesh and packaging. They can smell lunch meat for miles it seems.   Summary: not advertising just a example [wire mesh stringer](https://www.fishusa.com/eagle-claw-floating-wire-fish-baskets/?sku=108271), trial and error. Anchor your stringer very well or you'll lose it. Otherwise it's easy to hide below water. The clearer the water the deeper you'll wanna keep it otherwise people will see it and inspect.   Otherwise you could get a cheap cooler and fill it will food in sealed packages and ice then let the water fill it then secure the lid hopefully with a latch of some type then submerge it. It will last a decently long time in cool water.   Far from perfect but allowed me to keep a few days to a week's worth of food on hand.   Another idea one guy taught me is a ground cooler. Dig a hole deep enough you can fit your cooler lid flush with the ground or just below the surface and fill it with ice and food and put the lid on. The natural coolness of the ground will both conceal the cooler from most people but it will also keep the ice from melting for a while longer.   Best luck. Sorry for the long message. I have a bad habit of rambling. Feel free to ask anything else I spent 10+ years traveling the usa south to north.
zxuwvc,,j2g4y1f,Thanks for the indepth explanation! I'm also from the South and really could've used this technique this past summer when I was primarily set up at a camp ground with access to lakes and rivers. I hope I'm not homeless by next summer, but at least I'll be prepared if I am.
zxuwvc,,j2hmhkz,If it helps any check temp agencies. They don't ask too many questions and can usually get you work within three days. When I get sick of roughing it I get a temp job and save up for a couple months to get a down payment for a place.   Life is what we make it. Don't be scared to move around and explore options.

One time, I slept in a building they were doing construction in. I got caught in the morning... I tried to stay in the vending machine room of a motel like twice but I couldn't stay long. Writing about it is hard because I ran into the police sometimes and I knew they were just trying to wait for me to break enough laws to arrest me. That was really scary.

And to get upbeat moods I'd live in, thrive in binaural beats, vortex success minds in unison YouTube. Crime was going down in front of me I didn't flinch I just thought of my art. Let the conflict passed and went on.   The next place was a historical park railway. Omg the stone and steps were beautiful I painted those with my night vision plts a head light after dark.

We love camping anyway, so it wasn't hard to just set up a tent and a fire and enjoy ourselves.   Normally, you pay $10 at the welcome center and they give you a tag to put at your camp so DNR knows who you are, but if you arrived after they closed, they'd let it slide as long as you get the tag when they opened in the morning. We stopped doing that when DNR started cracking down on meth heads staying there, so they'd check for tags more often or want to see a text/email receipt for the camp site. Almost got caught one night with a shotgun when loaded guns weren't allowed, so maybe don't do this one lol

I would say very clear boundaries and let him know that this is only temporary. Let him know exactly what the rules are and that you need your personal space for your mental health. Don't just say it once. Make sure he truly understands everything. And that's only after you find out the answer to the above questions
zx7u4e,,j23qfbb,question 1:  cause he could¬¥nt keeps hisnlob  question 2: he literaly lost his job cause his employers said he complains too much about the least of stuff, i would¬¥nt know either but i think that¬¥s the reason he had lost his jobs   question 3: no  question 4: dude kinda assult me once cause we got into an argument about him snoring, he then afterwards apologies  after our care givers then in therapy ask him to  i truely care about him however i¬¥m bit concernd about my well being first foremost

zx7u4e,j21zmdc,,9/10 when someone in recovery ends up on the streets--it means they're not working a 12 step or similar program with some kind of sponsor and have neglected their case management since post-discharge. Most people staying and in some kind of sober housing can keep a job and pay their sober living costs/bills. There is a good chance your old friend relapsed and has bottomed out at this point--and is on the streets--and will just essentially use/drink in your apartment until he/she is forced again--into some kind of treatment or transitional housing. I've seen this so many times since getting sober in 2011

zx6mik,j1zy99j,,Same at my job at the grocery store. My manager saw a woman brushing her teeth in the bathroom, called her disgusting, and had security escort her out. And when I would brush my teeth in the employee bathroom and she walked in, it was "what did you stay at a friend's last night? Or what are you, homeless?? Brush your teeth at home" Then straight up tried to catch me in the bathroom after that brushing my teeth or washing my face. It's a bathroom, it's used for bathroom things
zx6mik,,j20n46u,Wow, that is seriously petty. I carry a bathroom-kit in my backpack and brush my teeth at work all the time (especially after sugary snacks, etc) ... shouldn't that be considered "normal" ?.. weird world we live in.
zx6mik,,j222fxh,I also have a bathroom kit. Sometimes you eat something that leaves your teeth gross and you just need to brush them. I also have baby powder to use as dry shampoo because my hair gets super greasy some days through no fault of my own (even when I wash it that same morning, that‚Äôs just how my hair is). I‚Äôve got a couple other useful things in there, too, like makeup wipes, shout wipes, poo-puri, and a small bar of soap (in case a public bathroom is ever out of soap).
zx6mik,,j222zsz,Yep, same. I have a little Goruck zipper pouch thats just long enough for normal toothbrush length. So I also have Floss and Aspirin and Tweezers and some Qtips and a variety of other convienence items (lip balm, nail clippers, etc).

zx6mik,,j20y9x7,Not everyone talks about their good deeds.
zx6mik,j1z2b40,,It's a fear response I think. People are in the back of their minds somewhat aware that most of us are closer to being homeless than becoming billionaires, even if you got a mil in the bank, it just takes someone you care about getting cancer, then boom, second mortgage on the house, bank runs dry.  Shit can happen to anyone that can cause homelessness, but people are afraid to confront that, so they try to distance with the illusion of separation. That person made bad choices and that's why they're homeless, *I* make good choices, so that'll never happen to me.   People think they can judge someone's situation when they don't know their life, or what led up to their suffering. But it makes folks feel more secure, even if they're really not, by judging people in the shit. And empathy is a skill not many develop unfortunately.
zx6mik,j1z4rsb,,When I was homeless, I would frequently find discarded hotel key cards, which I kept to flash at nosey people when I stopped in food like this.  I was always clean, and polite to the hotel staff, and only once did I have a problem (over a cup of coffee)  These place throw away so much food, generally as long as you are good to the staff, only take what you can eat, and be on your way you are likely good.  It's hard as hell to get an actual hot meal out there.
zx6mik,,j20slo0,Wow, actually I like this idea to help people I see that are hungry. We don't throw away a lot of food because the breakfast staff is good on preparing for the occupancy of the hotel but I can keep some key cards on me and if I feel like I see  someone who needs something to eat (I go outside to smoke so I see a lot of people) I can slip one to someone and give them a random room number in case someone asks (trust me, no one asks).

zx6mik,,j21s0h5,It‚Äôs honestly quite brilliant as long as it‚Äôs low key enough to not get in trouble. When I was homeless I legit would have cried‚Ä¶ugly cried at the kindness. Feeling invisible and then when someone shines on a light on you can be a little overwhelming so if you are able to implement this just maybe be ready for some emotions from folks.
zx6mik,,j216oik,Boss level thinking right there. Excellent idea. It 's folks like you that gave me the smile and nod when I had to utilize this method to get a good breakfast. Thank you for being awesome.  Some days this type of kindness can literally save someone's life or sanity. Not just the food, the sense that somebody has respect for what they are going thru.
zx6mik,,j217sws,Like I've responded to someone else's post our breakfast is not fancy, just scrambled eggs, potatoes and some kind of sausage. What makes my GM stand out from others is that he allows staff to eat breakfast which helps the staff do a better job. If it helps the staff to do a better job imagine what it would do for someone who needs a hot meal.
zx6mik,,j24j5nw,I promise you that a warm "not fancy" breakfast is leagues better than having another protein bar, canned meat, or donuts I had most other days.
zx6mik,j228zv4,,I mean, if there's a little local hotel that has enough compassion to hook homeless people up with a hot breakfast, that's gonna be the place i'd want to book a room at.
zx6mik,j1z0gmj,,I usually guess that people like that are in a lot of pain about how hard they have to work to keep their life running and rolling some shit downhill makes them feel better. But good on the hotel for stocking extra food and being willing to feed extra folks. (Edit: typo)
zx6mik,,j206rgd,But there's the lack of empathy again. Why don't they think about how hard the homeless have to work to keep their lives rolling \*and\* climb back up that hill? A couple of pieces of free bacon might be the best thing that happens to them that day.
zx6mik,j226j77,,I stayed at a hotel with breakfast as a treat, cause a real bed and ac (Florida heat) was nice.

zx6mik,,j20pajc,Actually the breakfast staff is really good at figuring out how much to make each day based on occupancy of the hotel so there is really not much left over when the breakfast ends each day. What made me mad about this guests review was basing a person's situation on how they look and also complaining that someone was able to get something to eat. Trust me, our free breakfast is nothing to brag about. It usually consists of scrambled eggs, home fries and some kind of sausage product (pork, turkey or maple). It's not like we are serving eggs Benedict or an omelet station. At this point I hope it was a homeless person that was able to get a hot meal that morning.
zx6mik,,j5javth,My daughter worked at one of those places and it was just tossed. It was in an area that was low income and there were homeless. Much of the staff was not well off and many of them walked or road a bike to work. If they took food home they could get fired for stealing. Food was mixed up and thrown away. We have places here that will take food. Food rescue places but much of it is not used.
zx6mik,j2evccc,,I did night shift at a hotel and a homeless older lady would come in for the free coffee and ice water late at night. I was always told by tmy manager to kick her out if I saw her. I felt so bad for her, so I always made sure to have coffee ready and would sneak her a muffin or two from the kitchen. I'm not surprised by my managers reaction though, since she wouldn't let the staff have breakfast/coffee/water because "it's for the guests" and "it would look bad to guests to see employees eating the same food".
zx6mik,j218p0c,,Because we are selfish and self serving because of the loss of the God spirit. Normally wen we do have the God spirit, it restrains behaviors that hurt others but not all people choose to operate the spirit. The ones that do, will make effort to be respectful of all people.

Ask God to enter this situation and life for both yourself and your brother. Jesus is the change.
zx0jt0,,j1y2ir9,Thanks for the kind words
zx0jt0,j1zmsw2,,Charges should be dropped to a simple Trespassing charge considering that nothing is or was stolen. I expect his attorney or Public Defender would counter the charges during Preliminary hearing.  I also would check court website for his court date and show up to show you genuinely care and want the best for him. If it is a first offense he may not get any time at all except the pre-trial detention considering he can't afford bail.
zx0jt0,j228vez,,Write a letter to the judge if you can. Explain he's been struggling and trying to find resources and were about to be in a position to help him more. Ask for any programs he could do to shorten his stay or even house arrest or probation.   My sister wrote the judge for her spouse. He was pulled over for a light out on license plate and they searched and found "marijuana". He literally had just bought it and had the recipect. it was delta 8 and you can buy that here, but cops don't care. They even tried to charge him for bud shaped cooked he got as a gift. Still in the jar in box that said these have no marijuana in them. But they looked just like little buds.   She wrote the judge and he was out on probation 2 weeks later. She also spoke at his court case. He was the breadwinner for their family so they were about to lose their house over that nonsense.   It's worth a shot. Look up how to write to a judge. That way it's formatted in a professional manner.   Best of luck, I hope things turn around for both of you. I know how rough it is being homeless or having family be homeless and be in similar situation so unable to help much.
zwxobe,j20sacd,,Everyone thinks there's resources and help until they get into the situation. It's part of the propaganda to make the general public think that being civilization's carnage is a matter of choice for its victims.
zwxobe,,j24kp0s,The fact that *Homeless Shelters* are a thing instead of actual *Homes for the Homeless* is baffling.  "How can the homeless complain? There's soup kitchens and homeless shelters! They've got *shelters!* What do they want, a house? Beggars can't be choosers! Pick up your bootstraps and get a job, SIR. And *then* you can *maybe* get *some sort of housing."*

zwxobe,,j2ady9l,I've been doing the same for the past few years, goin state to state
zwxobe,j200y96,,I lived on the street from 17 till 24 and i always hated how religious people try to convert homeless people, it's shameful they should be embarrassed, they're trying to convert people in a terrible situation. They make you listen to a sermon before you eat, if they really cared they would just feed you and not try to convert you. Most "Christians"(demons disguised as humans)make my piss boil. Nothing is free.
zwxobe,,j20l5p9,Agreed. In order to get a hot meal everyday in some big  cities,  you end up having to do what I called the church tour.   Basically different churches had pantries or soup kitchens, different days of the week. Some places "strongly suggested" if not flat out made you sit thru a sermon before or while you are eating.   Once my SNAP kicked in I never went back to those places.   I never understood the drive to manipulate people into your religion, in their most desperate times.
zwxobe,,j219qy9,It's cause they know some are vulnerable and hopeless and they take advantage of that under the guise of we're just "trying to help" ie: we are just trying to take advantage of the fact that you are desperate so we can add more members to our cult so we have more power, it really makes me mad, it is truly sick. Ha i used to do that too, go from place to place in the search of a full belly or even half full, F##K RELIGION!!
zwxobe,,j24k59a,Religions *have* to rely on manipulating the weak in order to gain followers because it's all bullshit and smart, capable, comfortable individuals would never fall prey to it.
zwxobe,,j24pskd,The homeless are not the weak. They are the down trodden.  Many homeless folks are smart, capable individuals.   Many smart, capable individuals living more "comfortable" lives fall prey to all types of bullshit all the time. Be it religion, or marketing scam, or the next "guru".
zwxobe,,j21fb91,I personally don't feel it's manipulation. I just think they are trying to encourage and uplift someone that may be feeling hopeless.
zwxobe,,j21rfpx,Giving people hope is one thing, requiring a person who came to you for a hot meal to sit thru a sermon before feeding them doesn't seem very altruistic to me.
zwxobe,,j24kbx2,Forcing you to watch a "Follow Jesus, gain salvation" video/sermon because *you're hungry* feels like manipulating an individual.   The only reason why they sit thru it is because they want to eat.

Funny thing is the only way to get free phone is if you get foodstamps. Only place I get food from is soup kitchens and food banks which is just the excess waste of capitalist endeavors. Stuff that would just go in the trash.

zwxobe,,j3cjsjp,Sometimes when I go to the food bank theyll have a table set up for a program where theyll asses your situation if youre collecting subsidies and give you a phone with a service. One time the service was called qlink wireless. Another time something else. Maybe its different where you are. Go to your foodstamp website and see if theres more information about it there. I had it a long time ago when they gave out flip phones with a certain limited data plan on it. Im sure years later its considerably better. One time they were even giving out tablets with the phones. Im super irked i cant get back on ebt because I dont have a phone to complete the interview. Catch 22.
zwxobe,,j2gxndp,In NYS you can get SNAP benefits when you are homeless!
zwxobe,j1y3nyy,,Excellent post, thank you for the reminder and sharing
zwxobe,j1zsps9,,*Really* depends on where you live though.  If you're in the US, that's likely true, but if you're in a country with socialized healthcare and social programs, there's much more hope.  My mother's gone through tough times, and she's met a lot of homeless people who she became friends with, and almost all of them found work and a home within the year after they went to therapy together. Almost all of them with the help of a social worker.  So if you're in Canada, call up the provincial government general line and see what's available. It may not be what you want, and it won't get you over the finish line, but it'll likely be something.
zwxobe,,j24ky43,Thing is, most countries with socialized healthcare and strong, capable social programs don't have a big homeless population.
zwxobe,,j24uvb1,That depends on what you mean by "big". Relative to our population, Canada has a pretty large homeless population.
zwx6hm,j1xevpw,,There is a sub for RV's.  Can't think of the name right now
zwx6hm,j2d3wmk,,For RVs, one simple bathroom convenience. A compost toilet is super simple. One that works as well as any 500 plus model is super easy to make. Look up tiny house compost toilet on youtube or blogs and you'll find both commercial and homemade units, and a plethora of info. Screw dealing with blackwater waste.  Buddy heaters are what everyone recommends. I do too. Little Buddy's I don't recommend as they're more temperamental than the standard build Buddy heaters.  For lighting, the oddest thing is that I've used a BALDR 330 watt power pack. I got lucky to get it for 99 dollars at ebay last year. If you use it only as a light, in a small area like a 8 x 8 room or a van, will last weeks upon weeks. I've never fully discharged it using light only. So in a small space, if you only use it for phone or tablet, and a light you almost need nothing else. For a laptop, I'd recommend a steady discharge like a Jackery. Laptops should have their own power station. You can go old fashioned and have a small gas generator, use it once a week to charge two to four marine batteries, attached cigarette lighter inverters and adapters will power your devices. I did that for a while. You can likely use the single solar to charge small mppt devices like a BALDR or a Jackery. Even stand alone charge controllers are being made with mppt tech these days, but the power stations have them built in, and they're fairly cheap. Solar specific wiring and connections are available, often in kits.  I'd recommend using those to keep your devices a little safer.  Also doesn't hurt to have one or more of [these](https://www.amazon.com/UCO-Original-Lantern-Candles-Yellow/dp/B000F6NNP8?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&th=1), with plenty of candle refills. A hurricane style candle seems much safer than a lantern. Both will contribute to heating in small spaces.  If you don't have electricity to operate the water pump, you retrofit a plunger style on your water tank. if you're lazy like me, just remove the fresh water tank, store 5 gallon jugs and use [these.](https://www.ebay.com/itm/132589729106?_trkparms=amclksrc%3DITM%26aid%3D1110018%26algo%3DHOMESPLICE.COMPLISTINGS%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20220920135752%26meid%3De537c4ddfc7d4f07bc94e7f572d72edf%26pid%3D101198%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D12%26sd%3D155292602531%26itm%3D132589729106%26pmt%3D1%26noa%3D0%26pg%3D2047675%26algv%3DItemStripV101HighAdFee%26brand%3DUnbranded&_trksid=p2047675.c101198.m1985&amdata=cksum%3A132589729106e537c4ddfc7d4f07bc94e7f572d72edf%7Cenc%3AAQAHAAABAC6VSE2uGkOxRbBlxpADtEt%252B6nrFsn6dL412bSwepwACVTVX%252BoTQ57irbgQIon20WcHpHd46x5CrmGN6RvXQPvNUOagVuGbdlVBhR643Q6nHpROcfciOybALDUmVrnYxytFmRSfWoqRCxkw9lxHBsmcPIUXmeG0bDhLPF2uZiqVYeNaVUlUExEdtFXDuTPM0GBSfq7eTGpQ0oDxtvsyjaITEzCMK%252F1vl%252BxGji3NodCzf4U07f6xLRBu5AFfuRPgK2jvMoiHYbTKnsxpAyCLXQK9iWIOo0pZzhmD8HPyjvF6iUYd5HqiVodF1DApL8gYiqf%252B6cS%252F2uaGv5BWt%252BIvgWJg%253D%7Campid%3APL_CLK%7Cclp%3A2047675)
zwx6hm,,j2d9xd5,Awesome suggestions, I'm actually a step further in a few things.  Light I should be ok, as I can use my rechargeable jump kit, it's also great to be a charger itself while the truck isn't running.  I already have a deep cycle marine battery, and even a spare car battery that's fairly new, freshly charged and there was even a refresh on my charger for the older battery.  They're topped up well.  I'll also have a (suspected) 400 watt solar panel, but due to it's age I don't expect to get even 200 out of it, but I do see amperage even on a slow day, so it'll give me a regenerative charge.  Candle options are GREAT suggestions, I'll go to the store soon to get a pack of small ones, I like a dark area anyways.  Only need the light for actually searching for things.  I'm smart with technology, so I've already got my mind setup to "What would I be doing right now, if power was questionable." I'm just perusing reddit and watching videos, I'd do that on my phone or a tablet if necessary.  If I want to game, I'll bring out the laptop and use it with the inverter and deep cycle battery being constantly charged by the solar panel, I think I should be OK.  In the end my newest goal is to hopefully find a way to wire up what I have from the truck battery to the deep cycle, for additional charging from the alternator.  I might already have wires.  I'll definitely be searching up the compost setups, it's just so hard to have everything thrown at me at once, with such little knowledge.  Not much time to prepare.
zwx6hm,j1xdqsh,,With your plumbing,  do you know if your rv has a reserve tank? I've never dealt with rv's but I would imagine there is a tank you can fill for roadtrips. Otherwise maybe a water hose connects to the side of your rv? Now I'm interested in this lol
zwx6hm,,j1xe2d6,Edit: I've learned rv's usually have [3 types of water tanks](https://www.campanda.com/magazine/rv-tanks-guide/)
zwx6hm,,j1xed6a,Oh, for a second I almost replied answering the wrong context.  Yes it has tanks as far as I know, but they've not been used, I'm trying to go beyond the tanks, and simply fill the toilet itself as needed, to circumvent any possible issues (edit: To troubleshoot, and have less points of failure or repairs needed.  I just need it in emergencies as I have... Problems).   Previous owners claim all tanks were in working condition, but not used as they're likely needing cleaning, and they had not used the toilet itself, and was clean so they assume it was working and nothing more.  I'd just like to ensure the toilet itself works that's it.  I don't want to use the internal water/plumbing, besides the toilet, and subsequent drainage/blackwater tanks.
zwx6hm,,j1y7esa,I think you just turn the water pump on and flush. It doesn't fill up like a house toilet before using. The flushed water goes to the black tank.
zwx6hm,,j1y7oxa,Where's the water pump.  Do I need to fill it?  Where do I fill it from?
zwx6hm,,j1z9egd,There should be a switch to turn it on. It pumps water out of the freshwater tank. Should be an opening to fill that on the outside.
zwx6hm,,j1z9ngn,Ok, is there a way to bypass the freshwater tank and just fill it manually?  I'm not going to have hook ups.
zwx6hm,,j201xvf,It doesn't fill like a normal toilet. You wouldn't want water splashing out while driving. You can pour some water down it after using it.
zwx6hm,,j20tm2c,I think there's a misunderstanding.  That's exactly what I want to do.  So, to be specific, here's a "Scenario."  I need to use the restroom right now, I just woke up.  No water in the RV anywhere, but in a jug.  How do I use the toilet?  Can I use it?
zwx6hm,,j212kd0,Use it like you normally would, then pour some of the jug in to flush it down. You may need a poop knife to get the logs down. Toilet drains into the black tank.

zwptu2,j1wb258,,Some are, some are not. Please don't scare people into not going with such broad statements
zwptu2,,j25hqll,Let me give you an update. this is the reality of staying in a shelter. People need to know.   &#x200B;  Two nights ago at Interfaith Sanctuary in Boise Idaho,  young volunteer was raped by a guest. Luckily the guy was caught and now sits in jail.    There has been abuse by staff. Staff stealing guests money. Currently the director and manager are being investigated for embezzlement.   I guess if reality scares people, they are living in their own world.
zwptu2,j208nmc,,Each shelter is different. I usually could tell by just watching the staff for a min of a shelter was crapy or not. A lot of these not for profits are left to their own devices and have very little oversight.   There are times I was in a shelter one particular comes into mind where they made us put our bags in a room for so-called security reasons the next morning they were tossing all our bags in the garbage and threatening to have police arrest us if we tried to go get them.   I didn't care I went and got my bag anywhere in law and behold realized that some of my stuff was missing.    Another time around Thanksgiving I was at a shelter and they were serving you know basically crappy turkey and it was spoiled and anyone who tried to say anything they threatened with kicking out.   I was at another shelter where they let the police in and these guys were nothing but unprofessional savages waking us all up demanding IDs and basically treating us like crap.  Another shelter I was in The men were made to go into this basement which basically they told us to sleep on the floor and the women were kept upstairs on nice cots and bunk beds later on we found out some of the male staff were exchanging sexual favors so the women can get better treatment.
zwptu2,j1x9dgp,,In metropolitan cities, shelters are a last option. Unfortunately the horror stories that happen in them don't normally get published. This is why a lot of people would rather sleep in cars or on the street then stay in a shelter.   On the other hand, there are good shelter staff that genuinely are there to make a difference. But they are Not enough of them. When you find one? Definitely value and respect them.
zwptu2,j1zqwb2,,never trusted social services in my area when i was homeless, regardless of my father screaming at me to go get welfare help since he's been on welfare before i was born. i personally believe you dont need to always depend on welfare services. i've asked other homeless people in the area i use to be in and i get told by this one guy, "they will end up screwing you over somehow and put the blame on you. I always had to go back to square one and I've been homeless for 12 years". i was greatful enough to know so many people growing up who cared enough to help me bounce from house to house with my cat. i am currently living at another friend's house but i have money saved for an apartment that i will be getting next month (my FIRST apartment)

zwpbwf,j1wbkkb,,When I was about to be homeless, I got more help from strangers than from family and friends. I don't know why people are like that, especially the religious ones. I had people tell me that God apparently wanted me to suffer. Yeah, well maybe God's making me suffer so he can see if you'll help me. Maybe this is a test for you, not me. And you failed.  Hang in there. I'm glad you have a friend who will shelter you and your kitties. You're strong, and you'll come through this. I lost my home and had to start over at age 51, and I managed. I'm still rebuilding nearly two years later, but it's coming together. Good luck!
zwpbwf,,j1x8ruf,Same. I deactivated my Facebook and other social media. About a month and a half later I logged in and unfriended everyone who once called me family or really good friend but went completely silent / disappeared when everything went down and I became instantly homeless. There are a few people I'm still talking to who ask about me and if I'm okay etc. And these kinds of circumstances, you learn real quick who your real friends are.

I try not to give money because he uses the money for other nefarious purposes, but I at least show I care. I just hope that he does the same for me should I end up in the same situation again.
zwpbwf,j1wseub,,Sounds like she has I believe in God and am better than you now thing going . Religious people are the worst it's the ultimate excuse to not help people.
zwpbwf,j1wgryn,,Addicts are generally selfish people.   Being clean doesn't fix the selfishness.  So don't take it personally, and just block her and move on and accept she used you back then as much as she could, and now that there isn't anything to gain she won't lift a finger to help you now.  For once more, she's selfish.
zwpbwf,,j1wi082,That is exactly what I was thinking regarding her addiction and apparent selfishness. Thank you for your input.
zwpbwf,,j1y2t95,Hang in there and zoom out of the situation to just repair and process your own. It's ok to care but it seems to be one way frenship. Don't over extend yourself again. Surviving homelessness is the main goal. Things will get better.   Mods or Cali, excellent helpful thread , very sad today about life.
zwpbwf,j1wlvgz,,I'm so sorry you're going through all of this.  Losing friends through this sort of scenario is agonizing.  I heard someone say once, "Every person you see on the street, they only got there after every single person they knew had failed them."  As it turns out, this happens a lot.  Most people choose selfishness.  I had the same thing happen to me with several friends.  I put them up in my homes for months, or paid their rent, or spent a year supporting them every week through some difficult life event (divorce, etc).  When I became homeless, when I had life difficulties, they all turned their backs on me.  Most painful revelation in my life by far.  If I have any advice, it would be to assume most of your friends will respond this way, and it could be easier to simply avoid them until you're no longer in a state of active need.  That sounds terrible, I know, but it may be better than finding out it's more than just this one woman.  I wish the very best of luck getting back on your feet soon.
zwpbwf,,j1xb9x5,Thank you so much. Everything you say is 100% true. I keep telling myself it can be a lot worse because at least I have a job and transportation. I just lost all of my money and got into some serious debt so I'm having to get my credit score up, save money, and have a few months of employment under my belt to secure a place. I lost a lot and I really don't tell many of my friends my predicament, but I told her because I knew she'd been there....but she's too wrapped up in herself at this point to be of any help to me.
zwpbwf,j1x6jcb,,First of all, once and addict, always an addict. One of the illusions of outcome produced by many homeless charities is that they help people prone to vice to shift their inclinations from chemicals to God. The only thing wrong is that 12 steppers often become self righteous and annoying in their new obsession. That's why evangelical churches foster them as potential members and love them when they're doing well. They can be highly intelligent, but are followers by nature, incapable of understanding agency on the most abstract level. Followers are vacuums of empathy when they need it but incapable of reciprocating when a once "source" or benefactor suffers need. It's something to look out for in the future when those around you try to exploit your empathy again. If you have to discomfort yourself for their comfort, if you're sacrificing your needs for their wants, they are parasites, even if they're family. they need to be the ones cut off. Your friend never had any compassion, filled that void with externalities, and now her fake conscience is the church.
zwpbwf,j1xws35,,More evidence to me that Jesus homeless cures make people worse people
zwpbwf,j1wo4ln,,As a Missionary Kid, that's so crazy for someone to say "sometimes God doesn't want us to be comfortable", No "One" should speak for God  That's very gross, drop her  Hey, spirituality is important, but in improving  yourself, to be better than you were yesterday  You should also give up your cats, it sounds impractical and probably holding you back
zwpbwf,j1wqrmy,,I've been there.  It seems to be an every man for yourself attitude now among us.
zwpbwf,,j1wzj6a,Which is weird because that's the kind of attitude that the Bible condemns: "f anyone with earthly possessions sees his brother in need, but withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God abide in him"
zwpbwf,j1w9e6g,,Honestly it's a tough lesson to learn. Be glad you won't repeat that again. I also had problems with my sister over this, albeit not homelessness or anything severe. Basically, I always called her if she wanted food, or if she wanted anything from the grocery stores. I always think about her or my family, and what I can buy them or gift them. Now imagine, I been asking her to buy me some crackers when she's out, because they are my favorite.   Then, she gets mad at me for even asking her to buy me things.  Come to find out, she's been buying those specific crackers and had 2-3 boxes hoarded in her room without my knowledge. I know this isn't as extreme as helping someone repair their life, but it's still a similar lesson on a smaller scale.   I guess I learned that when you help someone and are generous, don't expect that they will repeat the favor. It seems obvious and common sense for someone to repay you the same as you've done to them, but we live in a very selfish world. People have different personalities, priorities, beliefs, and goals that are entirely different from ours.   One thing I would confess on, is that she sounds like a terrible person to ask for help. I'm a Christian as well, but that doesn't mean I'll go telling someone "Your not surrendering something to God, your not supposed to be comfortable". I've been on homeless outreaches with the church, feeding, praying, and handing out bibles to people. We may give them hope and encouragement, but we are not there to judge or tell them its some sort of test or punishment from God.   I'm sorry it turned out this way for you, but be careful why or when you help someone. I mostly always helped without expecting anything in return, but it still hurts when someone else does the exact opposite of what you've done for them, I get it. I think you can definitely find some good help, but I haven't been through it, so sorry I don't know the resources. Just wanted to share what I experienced. I would advice you not to spend anymore time trying to get help or some sort of sympathy from that "friend" of yours, its going to save you headaches and negative emotions.   Good to hear you got a place to sleep and shower, I'm sure you'll make it through this. Best of luck.
zwpbwf,j1xra67,,yeah its amazing how many ppl say they ahve your back and then when the time comes they dont. or how many you would expect to have your back and when you ask you are suprised when the answer is no. the world can be downright cold and uncaring. but its still a great life that is worth living. so don't let it get you down. try getting a job, any job and saving money, moving to lower cost area, ect.
zwpbwf,j1ygxaw,,when circumstances arose that caused me to become homeless, when i was only 19, everyone i ever loved or knew completely failed me. my parents, grandparents, aunts, my son‚Äôs father, my best friend. nobody gave one single fuck. i was raised in a middle class christian family, they were extremely abusive but they upheld a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù image, i guess being homeless ruined the image too much. last time i spoke to my best friend all she said was ‚Äúyoure scaring me‚Äù like fr? im scaring you because i have nowhere to sleep yet you can‚Äôt offer a helping hand? in your big ass house with three empty bedrooms????    they so much didn‚Äôt help that i literally had to adopt strangers as my new family and now i live in a completely different state because it was my only option besides sleeping on the sidewalk. my new mom takes better care of me than my real mom ever did in my entire life. it‚Äôs only been a year and a month since i lost everything. i still cry everyday. i really really miss my family, despite everything.
zwpbwf,j1yidj1,,Yeah, when you're homeless, you see what people are really like. Especially the ones in "ministry".
zwpbwf,j1zb9fz,,That‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm homeless too and nobody seems to give a damn. I had to stick it out thorough this blizzard and my birthday is in less than 2 weeks. When I make it out of homelessness, I‚Äôm gonna remember who was there and who wasn‚Äôt
zwpbwf,j1w9rv8,,I would straight up call her out on her bullshit. I have a feeling the only reason she is doing well is because he fianc√© is probably the breadwinner so maybe she is co-dependent but at the very least she should be offering you to stay on her sofa. When I was in college, I had a friend go homeless and he was sleeping on the beach- I said hell naw, you are sleeping on my sofa. It cost me nothing to let him sleep there. Years later, I became homeless and he sent me $$ I told him I‚Äôd pay him back and he refused it saying it‚Äôs the least he can do. He lives really far but it‚Äôs nice knowing I can crash his sofa if I need to
zwpbwf,,j1wd2hy,From what she told me she's getting social security and government benefits. Her fiance is in some sort of recovery program. Your friend sounds awesome and I'm glad you have that support
zwpbwf,,j1xynlf,and unfortunately let it be a lesson , dont depend on no one , even your own flesh and blood will betray you. Depend on yourself. But i'm sorry for your situation and pray things turn around.
zwpbwf,,j1z7fgm,Oh I'm positive they will. Thank you
zwpbwf,j1x4xkd,,It's always like that. You help others but when you need help they don't know you. Think twice before helping again.

zwpbwf,,j1yr3xn,All of his bedrooms are rented out and he has someone sleeping on mattress in his living room. His living room couch is wrecked and the cats won't sleep inside with so many people so I use a bunch of blankets and sleep on his enclosed porch with them.

zwhu8b,j1uuh56,,If it‚Äôs isolated where he lives then no I wouldn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs lonely and there is always a trade. He expects something even if friendship. If you get stuck then what? Walk back would take how long?
zwhu8b,,j2908t8,Read my update whenever you get the chance
zwhu8b,j1vdgnl,,I stayed with a stranger when I was homeless and he ended up jacking off and watching porn with the door open. Be careful.
zwhu8b,j1uy6jh,,Make sure someone knows where you are, is all I can think of.  There are going to be people out there who try to live better than the horror stories, and people who live down to that level. The ones racing to the bottom usually can't help but give out clues.  If this stranger is honest, then they will understand your suspicions
zwhu8b,j1v2s0c,,Be careful!
zwhu8b,,j1vn35w,I understand wanting to help people‚Ä¶for some it‚Äôs a strong need.  Personally, I‚Äôve had enough time/experience where every time I go down this path‚Ä¶I arrive at the same conclusions‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just not overall safe for myself nor whomever I‚Äôd be trying to help.   It‚Äôs true that I‚Äôve been helping my housemate for some years now, but we‚Äôve known each other for a long time.  So that certainly minimized risks.
zwhu8b,j1vprq6,,I invited someone in because I was very naive. I thought a few weeks he could get a job or get disability going or something. He was very young, mom kicked him out, I felt like a mom towards him. No nefarious purpose. I did put him to work a tiny bit, which I paid him for, so he could get his id and personal needs. No rent.
zwhu8b,j1wi314,,I've stayed with a lot of strangers while homeless and hitchhiking but that was always for like a night. I've brought lots of people (hitchhiker's,homeless) back to my house to shower,eat,use wifi and relax and feel safe and warm. Sleep in a bed,etc. But I'm a small lady(but can take care of myself) & I go with my gut feeling. If your gut is saying NO! than listen to it. Your stuck 45 mins away from food,medical, is there even wifi or phone service out there? Being that far out your completely reliant on the other person so that makes it a lot more risky. Especially with no ride. Could you ask him for the address and Google map it. See what's around,maybe you can see the place from Google maps. If he doesn't want to give you the address that's also a big red flag. He might be totally cool but if something happens,that's a far walk back to civilization.  Good luck and follow your gut
zwhu8b,,j1x0v6z,They gave me their address when I asked, and everything they told me during our talk added up no problem. They have wifi, and there's a gas station and grocery store i can go to. I used a bit of my money to get an Uber gift card in case an emergency happens. I also have a couple friends in or around the town we're staying in that i informed of everything
zwhu8b,j1v9iyw,,If you‚Äôre female, no.  If you‚Äôre male, be careful, there‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch. He may not try to have sex with you or steal your money but he may assume because he did X, the least you could do is be treated like an indentured servant or co-sign a loan for him to buy a car to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you ‚Äúbuild your credit‚Äù. Figure out what his motivation is behind helping you and if it‚Äôs something you can afford financially/emotionally/physically/etc. I‚Äôm sorry to say it, but most people are not selfless. Someone who recently helped me get some distance from a physically and emotionally unsafe environment, still got overbearing and controlling and pushy for money towards the end of the month even though they initially offered their couch for ‚Äúfree‚Äù. The first two days, they kept pushing for me to decide and commit to a more permanent living arrangement and look at houses with them. I wasn‚Äôt sure I could afford that. I just needed a week to figure out my situation. They eventually backed off. And although they changed their mind about charging me rent, they did help me save on hotel costs. I didn‚Äôt mind paying them, because I already know how people are, and I didn‚Äôt expect the free lunch in the first place. But it just goes to show you, people do change their minds quick. Be prepared that this kind stranger may change his mind, too.   My own experience has made me somewhat cynical. But I understand desperate situations sometimes require putting aside cynicism and sometimes (let‚Äôs be honest) your best judgment.   I wouldn‚Äôt move in at all if it‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere and your way to and from future work is dependent on him.   It‚Äôs natural to be freaked out, you are very vulnerable agreeing to this. Only you can really know if this is a good idea. Trust your gut. Always ALWAYS have an exit plan going in. And don‚Äôt let him know how much money you have once you are able to establish yourself while living with him.
zwhu8b,,j1vheqv,I'll keep this in mind. Although, I'm not sure how a homeless person would have the credit score to cosign for someone
zwhu8b,,j1vlbsj,This is a situation that happened after I repaired my credit and had a decent paying job. The person expected me to not question it and just do it because without them I‚Äôd have been ‚Äúdead in a ditch‚Äù. Thankfully I said no, but it made living with them for the remainder of the lease very unpleasant. Just be careful.
zwhu8b,j1vsp49,,I've taken it quite a few people from homelessness so we're not all creeps.   They might be a creep but you can likely spot signs of it if you're looking out for it.   If you're a woman staying with a man the concerns are obviously higher.  Be ready to nope out at a moments notice if they start acting like they own you.
zwhu8b,j1wklsp,,I wouldn't. I took an older women up on a room share and she ended up being a crazy person, saying I couldn't use the kitchen anymore and there were constant fights between her, myself and her combative daughter due to rent hikes they wanted to impose. When you are room share you have no protection usually. Eventually one fight led to crazy granny coming running down the stairs with a butcher knife held aloft like a horror movie. Her daughter had to get in front of her and say NO! I locked M yself in the bathroom and called the police, they showed up like a SWAT team. Just because someone is female does not mean they are not dangerous.
zwhu8b,j1w78jd,,Give the address to a friend or family member. Stay alert and aware. Take it if you want, but take note of ANY red flags

zwhu8b,j1vpry6,,Listen to your gut
zwhu8b,j1wdrpi,,I‚Äôve done that before when I got hired and a coworker let me stay there for $200 a month and I was there for almost 8 months.
zwhu8b,j1vk8e6,,Maybe call the police department and give the name/address & see if the person has a record.   But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea. You don‚Äôt know this person. He could be a narcissist at best and a murder or human trafficker at worst. Narcissistic people can be so charming and reassuring in a lot of ways in the beginning.   This arrangement is potentially super dangerous for him also, so why is he offering? Most people would not risk their safety with a stranger. It makes him appear potentially predatory; or, he possibly has self destructive tendencies.
zwhu8b,,j1vzabi,Youre correct about Narcisisists. They love bomb and seem like the coolest people in the world, the opposite of what they are.
zwhu8b,j1wraa7,,All of these comments have merit and you should take them seriously. The problem is that we were not there when you met them/him. We haven't read the emails or messages. We don't know the area and we don't know your circumstances. My personal opinion is that if there's no Wi-Fi or cell service then that is an absolute no for me.   Are you on disability or trying to get disability or are you trying to get a job? Finding a job in a rural area is a lot harder than the city. Getting disability takes a long time and this definitely sounds temporary   How will you get groceries? mail? To job interviews or doctor's appointments? Are they willing to drive you?  Have you talked about expectations?  Made it very clear that you have no interest in an exchange that is of adult nature?    If you have their phone number or their name I would definitely do a background check. There are some free background checks where you can get very minimal information about the person for free.  Or even just a Google search for that person's name in that area.   If you decide to do this, absolutely let people know the address and the name of the person that you would be staying with and what the situation is. Make sure to let both groups know that you'll be checking in on a regular basis.    I'm not going to give an opinion against it or for it.... This is definitely something where you need to go by your gut feeling as well as think logically about how this will help you.

Point number two, don't go unless you have at least one friend in good standing that could be some kind of security policy, and/or leaving a public trace in a Youtube channel or something so you don't end up down a rabbit hole. Ideally as soon as you're "housed" by the strange you'll announce your self to the neighbours, it takes a village and strength in numbers.

zwhu8b,,j1xvuy5,Well whatever linguistic hoops you want to jump through, a person with two X chromosomes is statistically less likely to sodomize you and eat your eyeballs. But moving into an isolated place with a total stranger has untold risks. Homeless people are at risk for all kinds of things. Murder for identity theft, sex trafficking. You don‚Äôt know this person or this person‚Äôs friends or true motivations, and if you went missing or needed help, who‚Äôd know?

zwhu8b,j1y1oka,,I stayed with a stranger when I was homeless last time - BUT she was an older lady, who had just had heart surgery and was already power walking across a huge park in Newcastle.

Not because they are all creeps etc, I just would not have felt as safe and way to uld have overthought it.

I have a lot of empathy for humans and animals and wish I could do this for someone but., I also know what the odds are of the person being narcissistic and/or dangerous regardless of which side youre on is very high. Most of us are narcissists to a degree due to this toxic system and how its normalized but, not everyone is malignant or dangerous. Most of us are Dunning Kruger as its learned in our competitive culture where we have to pose as "winners" as best we can.  The competition isnt for everyone in best circumstances so its so easy to fall through the cracks when they are so wide.   Everything is risk reward really.  Can you survive without this? You may miss on out something great where someone is genuine but, you could end up dead. Obviously none of us have a clue.   I hate the terror that were all living under and some us are so indoctrinated we dont even see the danger right in our faces, youy do thats good, not so naive.    Do you have a friend that could meet this person letting them know that someone knows where you are? Or even from afar let them know that youre sketched out not by them but, maybe that you have trust issues due to your past. Who doesnt.  Maybe theyre ok with you putting up a pic of the 2 of you together on social media?  It could protect them too if theyre naive.      They say when preparing 1 is none and 2 is 1 and that can hold for any circumstance multiple protections and exits.   I feel like a fool sayin Im sorry youre in this position as most are just mouthing the "correct" words but, none of us should be so unsafe that we choose between freezing and potentially crazy but, its becoming the norm.

zw9vhc,,j1z1fiv,Well with Reddit we only get the story from one person‚Äôs perspective. Although you can give general advice about relationships and how to preserve your confidence in these types of situations; I think it‚Äôs irresponsible to tell someone to leave and ghost their family. Your situation has nothing to do with theirs so you should actually try to help them. I‚Äôm 22 and homeless right now and the one thing I learned is to stay in contact with the fam.  Not because they will provide for me or give me things but to let them know I‚Äôm alive and if I seriously need help they can somewhat save me. (Emergency sitns) not only that but relationships often make different twists and turns. Stay optimistic and grind

zw41ft,,j1tvvdn,ok, I'm not sure if this would work, but are you any chance near a beach or mall?  You can perhaps ask nearby store for a job and hopefully they will hired you and allow your kids to stay with you.  If you can, find some boxes and tape, and see if you can make a makeshift shelter, I think there are some subreddit dedicate to makeshift shelter out of cardboard boxes, and some of these cardboard structure are unique.  If your makeshift cardboard shelter are unique enough you can charge people to pay to take a picture with it, which should help for some time.   For the Beach, a makeshift cardboard shelter can keep you warm from the cold & wind. As for your children, if you are by the beach, they can spend the day collecting seashells and sell to tourists.  Seashells also work pretty well as self-defense weapon if needed.   Sandflea aren't much nutrient, but they're at least keep hunger at bay, you just have to clean them with fresh water before cooking, but they're somewhat more hygienic than left-over Pagpag. Also, sandflea would probably more sellable to tourist as street snack than pagpag.

zw41ft,j1sq2oe,,Call 2-1-1 and churches also as they should be able to put you in a shelter or hotel.
zw41ft,j1uj5u4,,Are you in an urban area? Stealth will keep you safe, if there are woods you can dig a hole & hide almost in plain sight. I've never been homeless outside of the US, so I don't know much about that, but I wish you the best.
zw41ft,j1vh6vg,,First things first your mother with two kids so you automatically qualify for better quality emergency shelter and take priority and housing options.  At the worst if you have a car sleep in there for like a night or two but there should be no such thing as you being homeless with two kids. They're agencies that will trip over themselves to support you.

zw41ft,,j1whabq,which city are you at? Maybe someone here may know some resources that could help you
zw41ft,,j1wh0d3,it's a common mistake when reading post in english and assume OP or the other redditors are from US.   Philippine speak and write English too. Sadly they don't have much resources to help homelessness like in US or EU.
zw41ft,j1vt0r0,,Be on guard. Get a tarp and some rope and on rainy days you can set up a tarp shelter(there are so many different ones. ) And you can wrap your belongings up in it. As far as food lasting since your in the Philippines,I'm not sure what the weather,but/animal/theiving situation is but you could always ask vendors at the the end of the day if they have anything they couldn't sell they might be getting rid of. Talk to store owners and ask if they maybe need someone for od jobs. Explain your situation and maybe so eine will show some conpassion. If it's not too rainy and if you can safely get your kids up rooftops are sometimes great places to sleep.  A sock with rocks in it makes a good legal weapon.  Jeez this is a tough one since most of us don't know your countries laws/rules/social services. Perhaps see if there's any single mothers pages around you on FB or Reddit, perhaps there's someone looking to share rent on an apartment that might also be close to being in the situation your in. I always hated doing it but there's always begging or asking people to buy you food. Where Im from you could stay full from dumpster food that hasn't gone bad(just past expiry date). Follow your gut instinct.   Do you have any family that might be able to at least watch the kids for a bit if you found some work? My heart goes out to you and your little ones. I hope you can stay safe and fed. Good luck and I wish I had more for you but I'm on the other side of the world. Take care.

zw1nut,j1selcf,,So what's wrong with ending ALL homelessness, whether they're veterans or not? Why the artificial classification of worthy vs unworthy recipients?
zw1nut,,j1sfq7t,I agree but it's a good start
zw1nut,,j1sh7s7,Deciding who is worthy and who isn't is a "good start"?!  Denver has a lot of homeless assistance facilities. I just read about one that won't kick people out for smoking weed.
zw1nut,,j1spf60,I think doing this will benefit all of the homeless people in that area. The veterans getting into this housing will no longer need to be in shelters and that opens up beds. Hopefully this can be a model of a larger more encompassing program in the future. I think veterans specifically have a higher chance of receiving help that will really help them as well. There's already services in place for them like healthcare with the VA and that's huge for getting people to be able to stay in a home. There's a lot of specific therapy groups that are free available to them as well, and that is a community they are exclusively part of.

zvw99q,,j1s20oi,alright then. A couple of weeks ago I was installing carpet at this place that the Supers apt. was vacant. I stayed in the bedroom closet for two nights.

zvw99q,,j1sh7ka,Was the blow up mattress for you? Too bad you couldn‚Äôt read the note I assume? I once listened to a podcast about a lady who knew a homeless person was sleeping in her car so she‚Äôd leave her car unlocked on purpose.

zvw99q,,j1rsrh4,I target multistory office buildings with shared common areas like lobby. Stuff around big parking garages. Look for signs of construction. I'm a licensed electrician so got a good feel of places to snoop around lol. Start pulling on doors all over and be surprised at how much is just left open. Actually doing some Instawork gigs. Lost my EBT card so that'd be best way to get food though. 7-Eleven used to have a code (711TREAT) where get $7 off so end up getting pizza for less than a dollar.
zvw99q,,j1skxx1,Man you could probably get into all kinds of places with some PPE and a tool bag.
zvw99q,,j1te84i,Your a licensed electrician? Why wouldn‚Äôt you be making money with that designation? And a little tip to all thinking of doing this. Be careful if you come into contact with a construction crew, they do not take kindly to people snooping around their tools.
zvw99q,,j1vkk7h,Having an income doesn‚Äôt equal having a home. The list of barriers to get into housing can be immense. More so if you‚Äôre currently homeless.  I work with a lot of houseless people with some type of income.
zvw99q,,j1tkf4q,I don‚Äôt want to sound weird or judgmental man. But I clicked on your bio. You‚Äôre a licensed electrician, an Oregon State grad and a former D1 athlete. You could do a hell of a lot better than sleeping in strange offices an eating 7/11 pizza.

zvw99q,,j1voneb,Dude what an ignorant stupid comment.   I was loosely offered a D1 scholarship for track well I was in grade 4 and reoffered 3 teams in the next 4 years. I also had the chance to move away for hockey all expenses paid and covered to a different province because their rural junior A league needed to take the next best from the rest of the areas. I‚Äôm a licensed plumber who could‚Äôve played for free or on scholarship in multiple different sports. One of them being hockey and I live in Canada so there isn‚Äôt any tougher sport to make it to the top in here or go on with.  I also graduated in time in high school despite abuse growing up and being in a foster house and through group homes/shelters etc.  I got accepted into every single local university and college. I went to school, got into plumbing as I passed with an accreditation and was able to skip going back for a level even. I got a great job that would be considered a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù that paid well, I had a 12 year old car that I bought outright. So I had a great job, my own car, was renting an entire house split with 2-3 other people, I had saved up 20000$ dollars (in Canada so that‚Äôs probably like 15-17K In American terms as things cost different and exchange rate) and had some money away in retirement too. I did everything right and am clearly far more capable. It‚Äôs almost as if being capable or credentialed really is only one factor of many factors in someone‚Äôs living situation.  I‚Äôve never been fired from a job in my life. I am far more astute and competent than most homed people. But ignorance is bliss so seeing things for what they really are is part of the issue, I know people I could run or discuss circles around but they are simpletons and just having a job and working blindly following the system is all they know.     Also keep in mind wrestling is an extremely Physical sport, for all we know he could‚Äôve got a concussion and changed his life, he could‚Äôve met a stoner roommate who got him to smoke weed and his outlike and motivations, ideals changed. He could‚Äôve just started viewing things differently after being in university for years   Also you know nothing about his family situation or mental health. Tons of the people with credentials such as him or myself are very mentally ill, depressed anxious, dealing with PTSD etc.

zvw99q,,j1ygfsb,It's all true. I came from an extremely tough childhood. I've done a helluva lot better. Certain circumstances reverted me towards this more raw stoic self-discovery journey. I'm oldest of 7 on full government subsistence. Beaten till scarred on my back from mentally ill parents. Have 2 missing sisters. I'm here in Chicago because met someone on Reddit via homeless group who was raped and found to have terminal cancer üò¢ I'm giving support. Didn't wanna reveal but kinda forced to defend. I'm not gonna pretend to suffer. I want to help the overall cause of the less fortunate.
zvw99q,,j1zz93p,I had a different kind of abusive upbringing, but also feel pretty intensely about championing for folks stuck on the streets more or less. I always think to myself that if I was gonna get into having a TikTok, it'd be just for documenting how many times I'm told to shove off by anyone in the city when I'm trying to just find a place to rest. So many people don't know how hard it is to simply get some good sleep, and good sleep is the backbone for everything else, including some semblance of mental wellness.
zvw99q,,j289kwj,Exactly! That's big part of my social media and hopefully future media opportunities allowing me to discuss all those compounding factors. Even something as simple as bathroom access. Or the places provided are worse than outdoors. Literally inches away from all sides at shelter in Vegas from random people who don't take care of themselves at all. Thankfully finding more nature themed parks has worked out.
zvw99q,,j2980gp,If we ever end up in the same neck of the woods, I'd be down to collab! I love making videos and have a camera for it now. Always happy to have conversations about this stuff too! So little nuance in the media because the narratives are so rarely coming from people on the street themselves.   Are you familiar with invisiblepeople.tv ? I really appreciate what they've been putting out.
zvw99q,,j2clrnv,Where you at? Don't have any equipment now in Chicago, but will something this coming month and gonna eventually post content from here.

zvu5do,j1s0qzs,,This is why homelessness never improves. To the right side ending homelessness means cracking down on the homeless, fining them, arresting them, bussing them out of their cities to somewhere desolate where (hopefully) they'll eventually starve freeze and die. It doesn't work in the long run of course, and doesn't solve why people actually go homeless, but for the short term it looks like progress is being made.
zvu5do,,j1twrkr,The left create the homeless with their greed, and poor economy. The right, particularly churchesdo more than any leftist. Even for illegal immigrants at the border.
zvu5do,,j1usj3x,Thanks for pointing out the work that churches do. Christians are berated constantly while they help the homeless population more then anyone.
zvu5do,,j1uszan,You've got to have a strong will to be homeless and make it, if you're not religious you won't be by accepting help from them. But at least offer to volunteer at any events to pay them back.
zvu5do,,j2i2jer,This is 100% true
zvu5do,,j1usbhp,No, the right does not want to hurt the homeless at all. They want something done about it. People should not be living outside at all. That should be unacceptable and not made easier. No one wants the homeless fined or arrested, unless they are committing an actual crime that warrants those things. The right wants something concrete done to get people off the streets, get their lives on track, and either working and being productive or in a residential mental health facility. Living outside is not, and should not be, an option. If the left is so compassionate, why do they do absolutely nothing for them?
zvu5do,j1s26qg,,Reminds me of how some systems in history dealed with the poor and homeless: Like in NS-Germany, homeless people were seen as "they don't want to work" and they were arrested and deported to "re-education camps", where they had to work all day long for no money (just for clarification: These camps were not KZ's aka concentration camps, rather work camps without the "extermination by work" doctrine). The Soviet Union wasn't much different, there you got sent to the Gulags if you did not fit in with society.

From what I've seen in my past the laws here in mass are not to kind on fires even controlled in a pit or even a small one. I get paid every two weeks and we were not prepared for this but hoping to make it to Walmart after work wed when I get paid to try to buy one of those small propane grills the small green cans.

zve7ke,,j1shp5x,Where would you suggest?
zve7ke,j1os5gi,,Florida , go to a larger city. Pensacola, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Myers, Fort Lauderdale, Miami. Try and get on with a freight company. Fairly easy work, driving a forklift, driving a truck (most will train you if they see you‚Äôre willing to work and you show dedication) .. also lots of other industries if you don‚Äôt want to go into that line of work. But bigger cities have more opportunities. Plus FL is the warmest state during the winter, especially south Florida. Try to blend in , don‚Äôt look homeless or like you‚Äôre living in your car. Park at busier hotels , apartment complexes that aren‚Äôt so serious about parking. Make friends to have a couch to crash on every once in a while. Snag a hotel room , try and sleep as little as possible in your car to avoid burnout. Good luck OP. Also check into being a truck driver if you think you‚Äôd like it
zve7ke,,j1oslqg,Ive thought about truck driving I just can‚Äôt drive a stick to save my life. Also I‚Äôve heard Florida is the most dangerous state to be homeless which I can believe with all the crime they have.

zve7ke,,j1s60h4,Omg. Hell no. Not Houston. I am a native Houstonian and I am now up north. That is the worst idea. It's way too hot and the crime rate is horrible. Houston is getting overcrowded. Austin may be a good city in Texas to be homeless but still wayyy too hot.
zve7ke,,j1sicrl,I‚Äôve heard California is overrated and incredibly expensive.
zve7ke,j1ovd0t,,Go where the weather is a little warmer.
zve7ke,,j1shne3,Honduras is beautiful this time of year lol
zve7ke,j1qrhm7,,Definitely California
zve7ke,,j1sj1eu,Why California?
zve7ke,,j1sj5ty,The weather‚Äôs great and there‚Äôs work available
zve7ke,,j1srth6,To my understanding it‚Äôs also incredibly expensive and it doesn‚Äôt look all that safe
zve7ke,,j1ss0dl,I‚Äôve been in San Francisco off and on for years. It‚Äôs safe. I don‚Äôt recommend SoCal or the Central Valley but the bay area is very safe
zve7ke,,j1ssjlu,Isn‚Äôt California in general on the decline? As opposed to most of the other states on the west coast
zve7ke,,j1ssoa4,No absolutely not it‚Äôs fine. Oregon and Washington are too wet n chilly this time of year
zve7ke,,j1sv1t6,That doesn‚Äôt explain the state as a whole just the weather
zve7ke,j1r065e,,whatever you do stay of if NY...really NYC not sure about other parts of NY.. but there is no help in NYC & even if you apply for emergency help there is still a 30-45 day waiting period
zve7ke,,j1sjab7,I would never live in NYC. Too many people all together like that. I would work there just not live.  I lived in Upstate NY real brief in 2016. I loved it! I‚Äôd rather live in Upstate NY than NYC
zve7ke,j1r9gil,,What I did, and I‚Äôve posted about it more than once on this sub, is got a traveling job that paid a wage plus per diem. Per diem is not income, it‚Äôs a travel expense and is not taxed because of this. So I‚Äôd stay in hotels near work, or even an apartment if the job is long enough since that‚Äôs cheaper. In the summer I‚Äôd even camp. For a while I had a pretty sweet conversion van so I could just stay in that and save/invest all of the per diem and not have to spend money on anything other than gas and food.   I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt have any serious conditions keeping you from work. You and I are fortunate that we are homeless by circumstance, and not by a disability or mental health issues. Use it to your advantage, as some people can‚Äôt. This is how I survived harsh Wisconsin winters and got myself out of homelessness. Now I stay traveling because it‚Äôs good money, I learned a skilled trade, I bounce around but make better money and stay close to a general area. I could even refer you to something if you‚Äôd like.
zve7ke,,j1s6cmw,Yeah this is a good idea. There were lots of jobs for setting up new stores. They pay your hotel, per diem, and I believe it was 17 bucks an hour. So I would do that. I couldn't do it because you can't have a pet with you. I have a cat.
zve7ke,,j1sbchw,Yeah that‚Äôs about where I started. I used to do rough framing and trim carpentry around 18 an hour give or take, plus per diem. Same with concrete or metal work, whatever laborer positions. Now I bounce around between shipyards mostly. Usually pay is around $30 to $35, part of it is untaxed so it helps a lot. Doing pipe welds would be similar or closer to like $45 if you‚Äôre skilled enough. Can get similar results with other skilled trades in the right place.   All I can say is, if anyone does this, save up and/or invest in assets instead of blowing it all or racking up debt. Too many people in the trades do that.
zve7ke,,j1spl6t,I‚Äôd love to be able to travel for a living. What did you have in mind?
zve7ke,,j1sqtj8,Typically construction. I strictly stick to welding now and mostly just bounce around between shipyards but of course there are other things. Sometimes, given my skill set, I find my own jobs with my own equipment on the side. But like I said, when I started out I just used my parents‚Äô address. Back then I didn‚Äôt have any specific skill so I‚Äôd just take a labor job that paid decent. Carpentry, concrete, whatever. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard, sometimes it‚Äôs easy, but it kept me paid and off the streets and got me into better positions later on. You can start a chat with me if you‚Äôre interested. I know a couple of different companies that do this.
zve7ke,,j1ss8eb,I‚Äôm not a skilled tradesman kind of guy. I‚Äôve tried construction so many times over the years, and I‚Äôve come to the realization that it‚Äôs not for me.
zve7ke,,j1ssd8p,Oh no. Well, what did you do? When you‚Äôve tried construction I mean.
zve7ke,,j1st6so,First off I went to welding school for a few months. Didn‚Äôt get the one on one with an instructor like I wanted and I didn‚Äôt understand the material.  I‚Äôve done General labor a bunch of times. All contractors are a-holes. I can‚Äôt learn from a boss who yells and expects you to get it done on the first try. Plus I hate construction. I‚Äôve never been a builder and I‚Äôve never been able to understand ‚Äúcontractor talk.‚Äù
zve7ke,,j1svfgx,Oh, yeah that happens sometimes. Depends where you are, I‚Äôve dealt with shitty GCs and foreman plenty of times. I‚Äôve walked off a job, called the office and went somewhere else in the same week before. I don‚Äôt take too much shit either. Well, I started with no skills at all, I learned everything on the job, including welding and steel fitting. To be honest even learning to read a tape measure I picked up on a job site many years ago, embarrassing as it is to admit it. Lol. But when I first started it was easy stuff mostly. I asked a ton of questions when I was on the job.   Well, I can give you some resources if you change your mind. Even if you can do a little stick welding you could probably get started near me around $30 an hour. It‚Äôs not for everyone but getting my foot in the door with shipyard work probably saved me. Personally, I love it, and some of them pay $50 an hour plus per diem. but there‚Äôs other stuff too. I hate when my company sends me to production jobs and things like that. I specifically request that they don‚Äôt even bring them up to me anymore. But there‚Äôs other stuff out there.
zve7ke,j1pbpbf,,There's a homeless gal in Connecticut that needs help getting out of there

zve7ke,j1q5cl7,,Johnson city tn I got hella bums as roomates
zve7ke,,j1siwfr,What‚Äôs out there?
zve7ke,j1s3g54,,According to articles and supposed statistics, the two areas that help homeless people the most is Austin and Houston, Texas. My personal opinion is that it really depends on your personal circumstances, age, what kind of weather you can tolerate and if you have a car or not.   I did a lot of research before I made a decision and due to my personal circumstances, Southern California was the best option for me. However, I am facing a whole lot of difficulties. I have been contacting organizations/ case managers/resources almost every single day. I'm having to do blood tests and talk to doctors and case managers and do online & in-person government forms just to get different government benefits.... Am I still have months ahead of me to get even a foundation started. If you don't have a car to sleep in? It's even harder.   Do the research. Taken to consideration what your circumstances are. Example? Are you a vet, are you not able to work? Are you having a hard time finding work? Do you need help getting state ID, etc? These are the things you need to research and then find out what area can help you best with those kinds of situations.    San Francisco is going through a major thing right now where the mayor may or may not sweep out all the tents & homeless camps. Plus there is a whole lot of crime towards homeless people there. Same as Los Angeles county.   The new Los Angeles mayor is trying to get as many people housed but the housing is not very good at the moment. they are still not working on expedited services for income to utilize section 8 type housing vouchers that are supposed to be approved within 60 days.  No income no section 8.   San Diego is going through the same thing like Los Angeles but they haven't come up with any new plans to help people faster.
zve7ke,j1s5jt4,,Go somewhere where it doesn't get too cold but don't go somewhere it is hot either. Sleeping in a car when it is 100 outside all day Sucks.   I slept in my car with my son and a cat for a long time. It was awful in places where it was hot. I prefer a colder climate for car sleeping.    That's just my preference.   You can always bundle up more but you cannot take enough off to cool off if it is hot as hell. I used to run my car 24/7 in the heat. It cost me quite a bit in gas but it was just too uncomfortable. That was when it was about 80 degrees. Anything past that and I can't do it.
zve7ke,j1sp7zu,,I'm in Phoenix but heard San Diego or LA is ok but I believe it's up to the individual
zve7ke,,j1srxpq,What about Phoenix?
zve7ke,j1tkeru,,This time of year Phoenix is usually in the 60s & 70s and many people stay due to the warmer weather
zve7ke,,j1upj6y,What can you tell me about Arizona?
zve7ke,j1uwryi,,Phoenix and Tucson are great places to stay until April or May then starting in October all over again
zve7ke,,j20ukg3,I had a woman message me earlier today with this sob story claiming she had tears coming down her face reading this post and then said she wants to help. She ended up burning me. I was given false hope once again. If your gonna be like that, seriously don‚Äôt comment or don‚Äôt message me. It‚Äôs down right cruel to claim to help a homeless person but then you don‚Äôt
zve7ke,,j20um5f,The heat?
zve7ke,j21cbty,,Yes it can be over 110 in Phoenix at times during the summer
zve7ke,j2ial2f,,try Colorado. everyone keep naming these big name states. Colorado has plenty of mountains for camping, lots of job are hiring. there are lots of safe areas in the city and in small mountain towns. the homeless population is getting worse here but that's mostly in Denver and the area around it. i would stay away from pueblo and Colorado springs. they are bad. the only negitive is that it is really freaking cold here in the winter but the snow melts fast so the cold comes and goes in waves. colorado is also central so if you wanted to go south or to a warmer state its easy.
zve7ke,,j61ul7r,So where in Colorado would you recommend? Ouray, Boulder, Aspen, I‚Äôm open to anything within reason I‚Äôve thought about Colorado for years. I bet they have a beautiful Christmas
zve7ke,,j628ysu,I would wait till springs. Anywhere on the south side of Denver is good. Like greenwood village, Littleton, parker. Ken caryl, Boulder, Castle Rock  and there is Aspen park that's ok for a short period. But then there is the real Aspen. It's a lot further in the mountains and it's a seasonal city. the key is finding a good spot where people won't bother you. I would avoid the northern city's like Aurora, Thornton, downtown denver. They are usually higher crime areas and your more likely to be harassed by police or other people. If you like car camping cherry creek state park does campsites. But it can be pricey. They have showers laundry there I think.
zve7ke,,j629kf8,Some more honorable mentions are grand junction. Haven't been there much. It's a desert city. Loveland is a nice farming city. I haven't been to fort collins but it's pritty big too.
zve7ke,j1s0xdh,,Wherever you have friends or family who will actually support you.
zve7ke,,j1sjg2y,I have neither. Completely on my own
zv7hm6,j1o08ar,,But why is this good for homeless people? No one should be sleeping on benches, or outside at all. That‚Äôs not an improvement, getting off the street and into a normal living environment is what‚Äôs needed. No one is going to get their lives on track living outside, making it easier to sleep outside is a strange thing to be happy about.
zv7hm6,,j1o4d9y,I guess you didn't read the thread and the subsequent discussion. It's complicated; read more than merely my comments and stop shooting the messenger. I was not saying homeless people don't deserve to be housed and I was not happy about anything. So also stop with the putting of words in my mouth.
zv7hm6,,j1uv5yi,Umm ok, sorry, a prominent line in the post says ‚Äúgreat news for San Francisco‚Äôs homeless population‚Äù so sorry I took it wrong.
zv7hm6,,j1pths4,Being homeless and not being able to sleep outside is a problem
zv7hm6,,j1uuy5o,Sleeping outside is the problem. That should not be considered acceptable for people. Every effort should be made to get people into housing or at least shelters, and into either a productive life or long term residential mental health.
zv7hm6,,j1uwszp,It is an improvement because the law makes sleeping illegal. It is an improvement, not a solution you buffoon. According to you, ‚Äúevery effort should be made‚Äù‚Äî what kind of solution is that, you are just pointing out the obvious that homelessness shouldn‚Äôt exist. You would rather it be criminalized. But let me point out to you something more obvious, it does exist and the humanity at large doesn‚Äôt give a fuck and they express that sentiment through their collective action to make it a reality while they lust for more private material wealth. It is an improvement because it is an actions being taken against the criminalization of something that shouldn‚Äôt be criminal.
zv7hm6,j1vf7x7,,Please read "all' of the linked thread before making comments.

There is an injunction to stop the police from confiscations; people's property was being taken from them by city officials. That is clearly illegal.   Yes, more housing is needed. Until that happens is it not a good thing the police will be obligated to treat homeless people humanely?  >Last night, just a day after the preliminary hearing in the case, a federal judge in the Northern District Court of California granted an emergency order in our lawsuit against the City of San Francisco for criminalizing homelessness. The urgently drafted, robust order prohibits the City from enforcing an array of brutal policing practices that violate the civil rights of unhoused San Franciscans. Additionally, the order stops the City from seizing and destroying unhoused people‚Äôs survival gear and personal property‚Äîan appalling practice that violates the City‚Äôs own policies.

zv6kom,j1nqiyk,,24/7 gyms, like planet fitness. Getting a membership is useful too because you can use the showers, bathrooms, and drinking fountains at any time of the day   Lowes, Home Depot parking lot. I‚Äôve stayed there and was unbothered.   Walmart/grocery store parking lots. Usually good parking spots and plenty of cars parked overnight.   Shopping centers. usually a lot of overnight vehicles.   Hotels. Stay discreet. Make sure no one can look in the car and see you sleeping. But great option because usually no one is looking for people in their cars at hotels because there‚Äôs so many cars there overnight.   Hospitals or Airports. Again, cars overnight, large parking lot, usually will be unbothered.   Truck stops.   24 hr parks   Churches. You can go inside and ask if you can park in the parking lot, tell them your situation. Be respectful and kind. They might let you, they might not.

zv6kom,j1nn94h,,Isn't it the purpose of rest stops to stop and rest over night?
zv6kom,,j1o3vs9,Not certain of the particular rest stop you‚Äôre mentioning‚Ä¶it could be due to the rest area having had some previous issues with people and so now that‚Äôs basically ruined it for everyone else.  I‚Äôve seen things go south before at rest areas I‚Äôd stop at almost daily throughout a year and then things get cleaned up nearly overnight and all strict.  It‚Äôs always best to have multiple spots handy just in case.
zv6kom,,j1o91h1,It was the closet rest stop in my area (others are like an hour away and I was short on gas)  And I'm so sorry to hear about the rest stop situation ü•∫   Having multiple places seems like a really good idea! Thank you sm
zv6kom,,j1oh3b5,It‚Äôs not always as affordable to live out of a vehicle as one might think‚Ä¶lots of factors.  Thankfully my rest stop experiences come from work, mostly. Only ever had a few issues and it was other drivers at rest areas. Never stayed at the same one more than one day.  Now one time, I did make the mistake of pulling off the road in VA while heading North‚Ä¶don‚Äôt honestly recall where I was, but fatigue got the better of me‚Ä¶yeah I got a knock the next morning by an Officer.  For VA, he was pretty nice actually once he he got a handle on the situation, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to do it again.  He asked why I just didn‚Äôt get a hotel‚Ä¶personally, I‚Äôve got a lot against them, when it comes down to it though, I just needed some rest and I know my vehicle and feel more comfortable in it. Way more affordable too.  I‚Äôve slept in my vehicle enough over the years, traveling to save, but also guard my stuff‚Ä¶then even locally due to certain situations.  Sometimes it made more sense because I worked off hours and where I was living at the time did not provide a good environment to sleep during daylight.  I‚Äôve slept in my vehicle while at my work, in parks, street parking in some areas, etc.  Edit: Must‚Äôve been a little tired or was having some issues focusing when I posted this reply. (With my mental functioning, sometimes it‚Äôs as if the egg just rolls off on its own.)  I definitely meant to add more to how expensive it can be living in a vehicle.   When I was facing the decision about ten years ago‚Ä¶It occurred to me then, the intricacies involved.  It helps if your young, healthy and have the right vehicle (preferably paid off), handy enough to fix some things, access to showers and bathrooms and are in a good climate to name a few.

zv6kom,,j1nnr1h,That's what I thought?? Especially since I looked the place up and it said cars can stay there overnight.  But I was just sitting in my car, just woke up and this man comes up banging at my window saying I had to leave. Every time I try to spoke he just kept repeating that I needed to leave and couldn't sleep here or he would call the cops. All at like 7am üò≠üò≠ like bro.
zv6kom,,j1nt0w4,Are you sure he works there? There's a lot of people who are irrationally enraged by homeless and perceived homeless individuals.  When PHX established Tent City for the jobless homeless and displaced families, they immediately had to militarize the zone because of blatant open attacks on the population, some of which included children.  The children were there because they were snuck in by family members because they'd been seperated by the state, or born there. They've since then done better at placing families together and identifying pregnant women.
zv6kom,,j1ntuwj,I assumed he was cuz the nights I stayed there I saw him leaving at night and be parked by the station center.   But you can be right! I was just terrified and i can't defend myself for shit if he tries anything. So for my safety I don't wanna go back ü•∫
zv6kom,,j1numsf,The shittier alternative is he's a hyper territorial homeless person.   I've never encountered one while homeless but there's hundreds around PHX, mostly in the interior of the Metro area.   I've heard stories that many of them actually own and operate vehs, though not often due to fuel issues. I assume they're experiencing a lot of anxiety.   Be safe. A lot of the comments about the gyms and Walmart are spot on. Some gas stations, near hwy exits, have large parking areas on the back side also. Well lit, but typically safe, and, in my experience, no one wants to park right next to you, which always weirds me out when they do. I feel like they're intentionally prying.

zv6kom,j1nfff2,,Truck stops.  Visitor Centers.  Some Walmart parking lots allow overnight Hotel parking lots  Campgrounds Commuter lots  As with any spot always check your surroundings and do not make a pattern of sleeping in any one spot.   YouTube has ideas on "urban camping/boondocking" that are helpful.   You can also search for your area and overnight parking to see where locals utilize. Some churches allow it also. Sometimes asking a church will get you permission to stay regularly.
zv6kom,,j1ng973,Nice! Thank you. This just happened to me so idk what's the right thing to do.  As I mention I stayed at a rest stop and getting yelled at kinda freaked me out. so I'm scared to stay anywhere. & I need to stay lowkey from the cops since I couldn't get my car inspected ü´†ü´†üò≠

If you aren't too worried about stealth, it would be easy to stack logs or boulders outside to make a wind break. Put lots of dry foliage inside to lay on, like as much as you can lay on without touching the ceiling to insulate you from the cold ground.

zus5e2,j1owfew,,What do local, state & federal labor laws have to say about this kind of arrangement? There are probably parameters for ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù labor.
zus5e2,,j1ox7fx,Good question. Rescues are typically 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organizations, so I'd assume the organizations members (volunteers) could execute free labor in the rescue efforts, with the unofficial side arrangement involving compensation other than money. There's probably some liability questions, but I have volunteers sign waivers to cover the risks of the work.
zus5e2,j1l8ce6,,It depends on their situation, honestly. Some, who only have themselves to care about, would totally be down for that. Others, like myself, need the money more. And, as you pointed out, a lot of homeless aren't interested in working, for whatever reason.
zus5e2,j1rs5aj,,I think its a great idea. So many homeless people love animals and have pets of their own they wont give up. I think its kind of like Pitbulls and Parolees with Tia Torres and her family hiring people getting out of jail or prison and they never had a problem with any of the guys. I love this show and I love pitbulls plus I love the Torres family and the guys who worked for them. Maybe try to call her and brainstorm to get some ideas of your rescue. Theres also some prisons that train dogs so the dogs live in the prison with each person whos going to train the dog. I think thats a great idea too it gets dogs out of shelters and helps them get ready for adoption instead of them being murdered and dumped in a landfill. I hope you can get something going and find people who need a place to stay for good work. You will probably have to pay them some type of monetary value besides housing and food though it doesnt have to be much. Good luck and let me know how its going.  Happy New Year. üíúüíú
zus5e2,,j1s1j27,Thanks! I'll check them out. We have a rescue here that does a prison "paws" program and it works incredibly well.
zus5e2,,j1s1tlf,I think most of them do such great things for the people and the animals and saves so many lives! I think you should check out Tias show if you havent watched it. Its great. Good luck and let me know how its going.

zuoy18,j1l7069,,Whatever people tell you, don't come to Florida.   It's been done, and they're sick of it. Things are changing, and instead of taking a compassionate route they're doing what they can to make it illegal to be homeless here.   There are few to no services, section 8 wait-lists are closed, the rents are going up even in campgrounds, the police are sweeping the forests and pushing people out, the laws change daily to make more things like sleeping in your car illegal and we have one of the fastest growing populations somehow.   And the jobs pay garbage and don't offer benefits.   I know so many homeless skilled tradesmen it's sad.
zuoy18,,j1m7zqn,>It's been done, and they're sick of it. Things are changing, and instead of taking a compassionate route they're doing what they can to make it illegal to be homeless here.  This describes Portland, OR as well.

zuoy18,j1pc247,,NOT PHOENIX
zuoy18,,j1sv8nk,Why?
zuoy18,,j1uuc0k,PHX had a long time nearly uncontrolled aggression towards homeless people before i moved here in 2015. Then w the onset of COVID it became impossible to ignore the violence against them as many people automatically blamed them for spreading diseases, on top of already preposterous list of excuses to hate a specific group of people.  When the city established Tent City in response to the blooming population of homeless due to job losses, they had to militarize the zone within the 1st week due to the number of blatant, and in broad daylight, attacks in the homeless. I'm talking about coordinated attacks. Not randoms.  It's gotten better, but the laws affecting homeless individuals have not changed for the better. If you're found by police, they can arrest you, so for the homeless w jobs, the situation is worse in many ways.  I pay child support (previous marriage)-the main contributor to my homelessness; i have a storage unit w $ks+ of my families household necessities, clothes and toys for my kids. My recent ex wife took our kids to Mexico due to economic stress because even with her job paying her $5k mo, we couldn't make ends meet.   I'm from Indiana, i lived in GA and FL as well. Those places all have 100Xs more and better services to help the homeless than the whole state of AZ, not just PHX.
zuoy18,,j1vb5qt,Thats insane. Child support is a big part of why im about to he homeless too. That and gangstalking. I know that sounds paranoid. it's really happening.
zuoy18,,j1vdgmp,Gangstalking is verifiable, and it's done in that way to make us look crazy. One way to liberate yourself from it to some degree is establish a C Corp (Inc) that creates and owns an . These need to generate income, but that's the way you should establish your company.

Just 1 evergreen branch, improvise some kind of stand, coffee lid, beer can or something and decorate.  Goes up and comes down in a couple mins and folks will laugh arse off if you have anyone come by your camp.  Anyway Merry Xmas, hope everybody makes it through safe n warm.

zumx8j,,j1kbjrq,I know it looks uncomfy but after walking a couple miles to get there, chopping wood all day, tending to a fire, and a beer or two I do manage to sleep comfy. Personally I hate mummy sleeping bags and sleeping on a raised bed because I got into the habit of side sleeping but oh well.
zumx8j,,j1kh1om,i used to exclusively be a side sleeper my whole life when i had a home but after i lost everything, my arm kept getting dumb after only having two blankets and a tent as my layer from the hard ground i became a strict back sleeper. no mattress really changed me quick.  i will give it to you though you look real self sufficient, you are able to chop wood, make campfires and boiling water for yourself. i need to pick that skill up, being able to just make food by my tent instead of having to go to a restaurant would be nice

zumx8j,j1nxg9n,,You live 2 miles into the woods? I'd be freaked out of my mind at night. There's few things that scare me more than isolation, even in a group, far into the woods. Literally anyone or anything could be lurking and if there is, help is far beyond reach. Even an unexpected medical emergency is probably curtains for you. I'd really consider posting up closer to civilization.
zumx8j,,j1rinlp,I think perhaps the worst thing that has happened to me was a little accident I had chopping wood. Cut somewhat deep into my finger but a bit of electrical tape patched that up. Yeah it is lonely, and sometimes scary when the Owls and Coyotes start acting up but I sleep better here, where I know with a couple shouts And a flashlight I can scare away the wildlife. Whereas in town I‚Äôd have to worry about my gear being stolen and being approached by a couple maniacs. It‚Äôs happened way to many times and I‚Äôm over it. This isn‚Äôt for everyone and is by no means easy. This shot is tough but these are the extra steps I‚Äôm willing to take for a bit more security. Worse case scenario; a mountain lion Mauls me to death but oh well.
zumx8j,,j1s4myn,I guess with internet connectivity and social media you're never really far away no matter where you are. I hear you on the robbery and unhinged lurkers at night looking for trouble. I sleep on the urban side, but I have found a rooftop to sleep on that takes some athletic ability and some practice to get up on without falling to certain injury. Plus if anyone is coming up looking for trouble the whole roof rumbles when someone is climbing up. It would wake me with plenty of time to get the drop on someone. So I sleep okay at night. I'm the only one I know that takes the time to hide when sleeping, everyone else just passes out wherever when tired and they invite problems IMHO.
zumna1,j1lxnpj,,Are you homeless, or do you live in a van?
zumna1,j1mgdpd,,I don't have a home.   I live in my car for the time being. A van would be nice, but probably too comfortable. I don't want to be homeless. I want to own an agricultural estate with a mansion/villa.

zumjdc,j1lqh8x,,I was homeless in downtown Detroit for about six months, having left a bad home situation suddenly with no plan. The worst parts were not having access to a bathroom, having to lug all your possessions at all times  and that no one will let you sleep, at least in the city. The experience aged me and my face ten years, just being out in the elements and the stress, and gave me PTSD. Every night I dream of losing everyone and everything until I'm back on the streets carrying everything I own everywhere. DM me.
zumjdc,j1mrd17,,Sorry. In person interviews only.
zuj998,j1jt6gx,, You can purchase basic necessities for him, and that wouldn't be enabling his drug habit.  You don't have to send any money.  If he wants to steal for his habit, so be be it.  Your conscience should be clean knowing you didn't finance his drug habit.
zuj998,,j25uh5p,That's what I had suspected, I'm glad to hear that others agree. We do send him items far more often than we send cash, but it may be time to stop sending cash altogether
zuj998,j1khpvo,,The way i see it, anything that enables him to have food in his belly and a roof over his head is enabling him - to survive. Dead people don't recover, and it's really hard to get clean when you're homeless and hungry.   I know it can be hard to know exactly where to draw the line. If he has EBT, you may be best off paying his rent directly to the landlord and phone bill directly to the company (if you/your mother are so inclined. he's very lucky to have family that cares). If he has food and shelter and a phone, he's in an excellent position to try and get himself together.
zuj998,,j25w50v,Dead people dont recover--- you've voiced my main rationalization for funding him perfectly. As much as I want to at times, I dont blame him for what hes doing. Our childhood wasnt exactly stellar and he has it so much worse now that hes on the streets. Trying to balance compassion with making excuses for him is such a challenge lol.
zuj998,j1kvsm6,,Honestly, it does sound like you guys are enabling him. I don't personally have a family member that is homeless, but I do know that homeless people can get free clothes/food from programs or even church outreaches and such. Seems whatever you give him is going towards drugs. STOP giving him money itself. There must come a breaking point where he gets tired and actually wants help. Some addicts just take time to hit that point. The best you can do is keep in contact and remind him how much you love him. You won't help him one ounce feeding his addiction, he will get the money no matter what, don't let him have a steady income from you guys.
zuj998,j1jv3x0,,What exactly does he need money for, that you can't buy directly and ship to him?  A sign a person is doing drugs are big purchase items they can sell.  Just send basic necessities, low cost items.  Nothing he can sell.  You don't have to send money.  He should be able to carry the heavy load himself.  Even his drug habit if he has one.  So yes.  You could be enabling him if you keep sending cash.  Stop doing that and ask him what he needs on a regular basis.  It shouldn't be much if he is homeless.    And don't listen to the store manager.  Yes he's in bad shape if he's homeless.  And I bet the store manager doesn't want him in the store strictly because of that alone.  They are probably lying about him stealing.  You really don't know how much society hates homeless people.  People just make things up to ruin your already tarnished reputation.
zuj998,,j1kvkt7,Yep.  I got discriminated against at a local grocery store just because I ended up riding the bus there and had brought bags in with me. Never mind that I went through a register with an actual cashier and paid‚Ä¶they purposely locked the wheel of the buggy up as I was leaving the store.  So yeah, if they think you‚Äôre homeless‚Ä¶not only will they do stuff like this, but will flat out lie about it as well.  Here‚Äôs how you tell‚Ä¶ask the manager for evidence and or otherwise and if they can‚Äôt provide it‚Ä¶they‚Äôre just blowing smoke.  Take it from me though‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not even worth your time in this case unless you happen to: be there,and have it recorded.  I‚Äôm fairly certain you‚Äôre not going to be able to keep your mother from enabling‚Ä¶or at least that‚Äôs also how it‚Äôs gone in my family as well.
zuj998,,j1kw69q,Yea.  Having a backpack pretty much makes you a mark for being homeless.  And yes a store manager WILL LIE TO YOUR MOTHER if that's what it takes to keep someone homeless out of their store.  I've seen and experienced worse.  The general public has no idea the shit we go through.  As a precaution I try to stay out of stores.  I use Amazon lockers & delivery services.
zuj998,,j1kzabo,Believe it or not‚Ä¶I had just came from the local old courthouse where registrations and titles are conducted with the same bags‚Ä¶walked in and out just fine. No trouble from the guards. Sure, had to go through the medical detector, but again no trouble there.  Completely different experience at the grocery store‚Ä¶so yeah, I don‚Äôt go there anymore nor any other store from that chain.  I did go down and speak with a social worker at a local shelter about the situation as well as about some others issues.   Because you‚Äôre right I (the general public) do not know what you all go through, unless something happens in our lives, something changes‚Ä¶for me, it‚Äôs been a multitude of things (I‚Äôve had some rough patches), but this particular situation was due from a medical diagnosis that caused me to have to use the bus system.  Turns out the social worker that runs the particular shelter I went to has a coworker who‚Äôs husband works with me, which we‚Äôve been working together for the past 17 years.  He‚Äôs been there a bit longer than me though.  Not sure it did any good‚Ä¶time will tell I guess.  Hey Merry Christmas or abouts!
zuj998,,j291d6n,Okay, I know it‚Äôs been some days.,.took me a bit to find this too.  I‚Äôm at a bit of an Impasse because of the topic and our discussion.  1.) Since I‚Äôm aware of the abhorrent level of discrimination in the Public especially ‚Äúgrocery stores across the US and into Canada‚Äù‚Ä¶and I‚Äôve already at the least gone as far to share my story with a local shelter administrator.  Why not take it further? There‚Äôs an obvious need for a system of checks and balances in this area.  2.) Due to my experiences and such‚Ä¶I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if I am somewhat considered to still be a part of the general public?.  My mental health has certainly taken massive hits (continues) since being out of work and things aren‚Äôt looking good.
zuj998,,j25u20q,Wow, I honestly never even considered that the manager may have been untruthful. As I said, he does have a history of this behavior so it's very possible they told the truth, but the fact that I took her word over his without hesitation is eye opening to say the least.   Thank you for that perspective, and I appreciate all the replies on this comment and sincerely hope the best for all of you
zuj998,j1jlx70,,I mean of course the more money he has the less he has to shoplift and the more he has for drugs plus other needs. But I would not fund that personally.
zuj998,j1jp8df,,I think you can give him the money as long as he talks to you. Basically pay him to keep in touch. I also think that doing drugs is OK but shoplifting is wrong and you must make that clear to him. Doing drugs is no excuse for crime. Encourage him to get a job or go to school.
zuj998,j1kdti9,,Tough, tough spot and really feel a bit uncomfortable even commenting.  If you can afford it then it's at least like you're somewhat helping to keep him alive and going but anyone whose living that way isn't living right. If you can call being on the street living   More like surviving. Youre not going to convince your mom to stop being a mother and painful as it is, yes I think cutting someone ( even loved one) off can be an only choice.  Take everything away, they hit rock bottom and only have a couple hard choices left. Change, get it over with or maybe do something really dumb/desperate and wind up incarcerated.  At least they'd have food, shelter and a chance to change. You can't save someone from themselves. Think sometimes the issue has to be forced, a person left w no other choice than do what they must, either way.  Oops, another edit. If/when they start making a real and sincere effort to get better. If you still have the energy and resources to want to help ... Cool. Let him know that too.
zuj998,j1mhi4p,,Maybe you can talk to your mom and see about getting him into a rehabilitation center?
zuj998,,j25vcei,We've discussed it, but he's always been extremely resistant to any type of therapy or authority, and to be honest even between both my mom and I we'd need loans to afford it.  I'd be willing to try if i thought it would stick, but he's no where near the point of wanting to change. Hes also in a relationship with an addict, and I worry that unless BOTH of them go through rehab and actually make an effort, one of them will just drag the other back in.
zuj998,j1myk5y,,I would say rather than sending money, send supplies. Pay for motel stays or gift cards to restaurants or whatever, but pay it directly when possible. I mean, he's going to do what he's going to do regardless. But handing him cash money is probably not the way to go right now. I know how hard it is because of course you want to help him.
zuj998,j1n2ulo,,Never give an alcoholic and/or addict money as it will support their habit
zuj998,j1oaz84,,If you truly want to help, go see your brother in person. If he is using, you will know. Then force him into a rehab program. If not you might as well stop sending him money as you are just prolonging his suffering and death.
zuih3b,j1jojzf,,I'm in DFW TX. There are homeless who live in cars/hotel rooms, camping homeless and shelter homeless (we'll simplify with these three main groups).  Car/Hotel homeless are typically on the way up or on the way down. Gas is the greatest gift for them because they can do DoorGrubFavCartEAT (not to advertise anyone but you get the point). One of those machines that jump-starts your car and inflates your tires is also AMAZING (they can't afford roadside and sometimes even get gig work AS roadside with them).   Camping homeless is predominantly male and disproportionately former military. They would cherish a good quality tool or gear. It doesn't have to be brand or new but proven quality coolers are keeping them alive in summer and proven quality sleeping bags are keeping them alive in winter. Tents can be iffy because they're highly visible and some cities even patrol with drones (homeless veterans are next level with booby traps...). Solar chargers, flameless lighters ... tools and gear.   Shelter homeless is a whole different world and most of the shelters have strict rules about outside food, bedding, tools, etc. A working bicycle is the first step towards independence for most people in shelter because our public transportation is so piecemeal. Other coveted items are unlocked old phones (call the provider and make sure) tablets, Chromebooks, or anything that can be used on shelter WiFi. So, headphones and charging cables are also greatly appreciated.   Old unlocked phones go for everyone, really. Those on grid can use the "Obama phone" program (only the SIM card is free for many) and off can use WiFi at restaurants or similar. MANY homeless are getting psych services, legal issues resolved and visiting with family via video chat.   HTH
zuih3b,,j1k6tcl,What I wouldn‚Äôt do for a jump starter why do they have to be so expensive
zuih3b,,j1k9axn,Right?! I'm on foot at the moment but it's one thing I kept from my lease car from my "before" life because it was worth the inflated fee hitting my credit. I was driving my AWD SUV and milking those $800 tires as far as I could with the compressor. Especially when the weather got cold. Walking out of 16hrs at a certain megacorp warehouse to several inches of snow and a flat was brutal üôÑ  Oh, and YES, many of us "megacorp permanent legitimate employees" were homeless. I'm a shelter sheep at present and most of us work.
zuih3b,,j1k9isy,If it wasn‚Äôt so cold I‚Äôd be giving my vehicle back as it‚Äôs almost $400 a month and a total pos
zuih3b,,j1kbyhj,Oof
zuih3b,,j1kc1pp,Battery went this morning had to walk 18 minutes to find shelter
zuih3b,,j1krevj,Super Start Power Pack from O'Reilly's is only $84. It's got one good charge in it to begin with, but you should do everything you can to charge it for the 36hrs before 1st use. You can use it to charge you phone. It has a cigarette adapter charging cable so you can recharge it while you're operating your veh, which is what I do.   A new battery will be about $200; and Alternator will be about $300.
zuih3b,,j1krmly,Currently with all my debts and stuff I don‚Äôt have anything left over for anything. Partly why I‚Äôm homeless is I‚Äôm in a money hole I cant seem to dig myself out of currently. Trying my best though hoping to consolidate soon
zuih3b,,j1kzsac,Go to r/assistance and see if anyone can help you without having a jumpstarter
zuih3b,,j1kru6h,Are you homeless?
zuih3b,,j1lxuaf,Yes
zuih3b,,j1mg0o7,I started r/HomelessHomebound for people like us. I'm tryna get more content creators who were homeless but got themselves out of it, but I'm also seeking individuals like myself who are homeless and currently working our ways out of this.  I hope it'll help you.
zuih3b,,j1mg9mb,I'm learning HOW to be homeless because there are life skills that I just didn't have.
zuih3b,,j1mh4ud,You literally could learn those same life skills in the Peace Corps or the Army, and have less chance of getting a disease, killed, or a criminal record. And if you're homeless, it takes a long time to notify your family. Authorities don't give a shit about us. At least in the PC or the military, you'll have medical treatment available w/out suffering abuse (if an ER seems you a danger to yourself you could lose your rights to self determination, and end up drugged up in a psych ward until they seem you fit to be released, and no, they don't inform your family until they feel you can effectively communicate with them)
zuih3b,,j1n8o51,I have been in "protective custody" with doctors feeding me pharmaceuticals that were literally poisoning me. I know enough to have them do repeat labs so you can see the evidence. As a person living with psych issues since childhood, I couldn't join the military or anything similar. I grew up in rural homelessness but it's very different than urban homelessness.
zuih3b,,j1n9igq,The hardest part about homelessness in any environ is being alone. Regardless.   I feel that if you got yourself established in a cheap studio somewhere and just spent the next year as a hermit, you'd be able to experience the loneliness, without jeopardizing your safety. Start hiking, like, long trip hiking and camping, where you coordinate w local wildlife/resource officers on your planned trip, start/stop points and end. THEN, if you still feel that isn't enough, THEN go take your chances on the streets. Start with a car for a year, then sell it, and foot it.   Keep in touch. I'd like to know what you're learning about yourself and others.
zuih3b,,j1pvgn4,I think that you misunderstood. I'm homeless because our government sucks and I was fired in error with little recourse. Now I have to learn HOW to live like this because I attempted suicide and keep getting brought back to life.
zuih3b,,j1q50ey,You're right.   What's stopping you from getting a new job?
zuih3b,j1jhycy,,A lunch date! I‚Äôve taken some people out for a hot meal. I used to do this with a friend in high school. We‚Äôd just ask if they wanna get food, and we‚Äôd eat together and hear their story of how they got to where they were.
zuih3b,j1jvcqa,,A hot meal if it's Christmas.  Maybe a good sleeping bag.  It really depends on the person.  Most times you just have to ask.
zuih3b,,j1l1ab4,>Most times you just have to ask.  This is the answer right here. Everyone‚Äôs situation is unique. When I was on the street, I could find a use for pretty much anything that anyone gave me and I was appreciative of anything, but whenever someone asked there were definitely some things I needed more than others.
zuih3b,j1kr0ry,,What type of homeless are we talking about?  "Choosers" those who choose to be homeless, are probably fine without charity while still grateful for it; Panhandlers will be really grateful, but, what are you getting them? Coffee?   For both of them, I'd say non perishable beef/protein items and instant coffee.   What would really be awesome is MREs, but those are expensive.   People living out of our veh need financial help, because that veh gets us back n forth to our jobs, but we probably don't have savings for auto service and repairs-so, that more so than money. Besides that, everyone can use hotel vouchers.
zuih3b,j1jhb5j,,A tent, sleeping bag, possibly a portable heater depending on what state they‚Äôre in. Help finding a job, maybe they don‚Äôt have a resume. Who knows?
zuih3b,j1k3l02,,Everyone wants to give food but if someone is completely homeless they will not have a place to store it, and you can only eat so much. No refrigeration sucks, i did that for six months almost. Socks, socks get nasty fast, and it can affect your feet if you don't have a place or money to wash them. But not crappy dollar store socks, quality ones. Also anti dierrea meds because things happen, people get sick and nothing is worse than having the runs and no place to go to the bathroom.
zuih3b,j1kaos1,,Socks and underwear
zuih3b,j1lqmnj,,A six pack and a joint would make someone's whole year, understand you don't wanna help support their habits but if you just want to brighten someone's year..
zuih3b,j1md489,,In this season, sleeping bags, warm blankets.    A battery powered heater with a pack of batteries.   Food. A warm meal. Dry food that they can keep and eat for at least a few days, like bread, peanut butter, jelly.
zuih3b,j1megf0,,Why not money?? I don‚Äôt understand why people always say this. I get it, everyone thinks we buy drugs but do not true. It‚Äôs great that you are helping and I appreciate it from someone who has fell on rough times. It means everything.
zuih3b,j1mpsow,,Gift cards
zuih3b,j1t3enh,,It sounds like you may be looking for items to provide to an organization that serves homeless folks to give to people.  If that's the case, asking the org what they need is best.  I worked with one and sometimes we needed men's underwear, other times it was cold medicine, it depended on what was in demand and what we already had.  We never needed socks, because every school, scout troop and church collected socks for the homeless.  We had over 2000 pairs of socks at one point, and every year we'd end up with more than we started.  We handed out a lot of socks...we just got more than we gave out.    One of the most in demand things turned out to be meal bags with a variety of items, all ready to eat along with plastic utensils and a plate and paper towels.  All bags had a main course item (pop-top beef ravioli, Vienna sausages, tuna/chicken kits with crackers), Slim Jims, peanut butter packets, candy and/or cookies and water and 100% juice boxes, raisins or applesauce, pudding cups.
zuih3b,j1kh59h,,Money.   Why you so judgemental?  Edit to add: all the homeless people I know are very adept at finding the things they need to survive, but they never get splurges, like even a cold soda can be a splurge.   So if you're talking about spending a nominal amount of money that won't materially change their lives, why begrudge them the choice to do something unhealthy with it?  What did that comedian say? He didn't want to give the homeless guy money because he would spend it on drugs and alcohol, but that's exactly what he planned to do with it himself?  You want to know what to give the homeless?   Here is a real answer: after Christmas go to every store in town and buy all their clearance candy. Bring some to every food pantry in your area. Many people don't know this, but food pantries hide the candy and give it to the kids who come through. Do that and you actually gave someone's child a real Christmas present.
zuih3b,,j1l0f8q,There was no judgement expressed in the OP, they just said they didn‚Äôt want to give money. They never said they didn‚Äôt think homeless people could be trusted with cash and they didn‚Äôt say they were concerned that cash would be spent frivolously.   There are plenty of reasons why someone might want to give something other than cash. Some people just don‚Äôt like giving cash as a gift, some people feel like it‚Äôs impersonal, utilitarian. My stepmother is like that; to her it‚Äôs rude to give cash as a gift because it shows that you didn‚Äôt want to put any thought or effort into it.
zuih3b,,j1l643s,Impersonal?  What's more impersonal than asking strangers what generic item they can buy and just expect all homeless people want, need, or appreciate?  Of course there's judgement when someone says "no cash," the judgement is implied.
zuih3b,,j1wwfhd,Yea think n of kids. Good on you. 1st response who thought of someone besides themselves. You will be happy to know I am going to take your advice
zuih3b,,j1xzs6o,Perfect.   I was feeling jaded when I wrote that, so I'm sorry for the passive-aggressive shit at the top.   Really, tho, homeless kids don't often get treats unless the pantry has them. It's what I would do.
zuih3b,j1lfr2l,,Drug dealer gift cards, aka, cash.   No, seriously, why would you expect there is some one-size fits all answer that all homeless people "need the most"?  Every homeless person I know has a different greatest need. I learned those by getting to know these people.   Unless you are going to get to know people and ask them individually what they want, the best thing is just trust them to do what they need and give them money.   If you're afraid of people spending your money on drugs and alcohol just don't give to the drunks or addicts, they're pretty easy to spot on account of being always inebriated.   Disabled vets make up a huge portion of our homeless population. Probably the best thing you could give some of them is just friendship, which costs zero dollars but takes maximum effort.
zuih3b,,j1wvzbj,Good info. Thanks
zuih3b,,j1x8wd7,I very much don't mean to be rude, but you should put some effort into getting to know some homeless people in your area before deciding that you want to help the homeless.

zuejwk,j1j1yqn,,VA is a waste of time, they usually only offer the same help as regular non profits, and rarely have any programs just for veterans. Dispute what they will say about their spending, all that tax payers money that is allocated to veterans, go to those non profits. They help more non veterans than veterans.
zuejwk,,j1k5hg9,Pretty much. Anytime i try to get set w counseling they prescribe me shit i expressly tell them i won't take. Ive never freaked out on my family or coworkers, until then, i don't need meds, i just need someone to talk to. Anyways
zuejwk,,j1ml9xu,I've fought the VA for 35 years now. They're worse than useless.
zuc3yj,j1j36sj,,I like it outdoors. I'm not a junkie or a drunk. I'm homeless but not a bum, I get my compensation from the VA, 100% totally and permanently, service connected. So money is not my biggest issue. I did struggle more when I was renting, and simply do not wish to rent nearly condemned buildings. So after the COVID restrictions were lifted, and all the realtors in my city decided to do mass evictions, renovate and charge more, I can't afford to rent. I'm saving my money waiting for the housing market to drop, and hopefully, finally, be able to afford something with the VA home loan guarantee.
zuc3yj,,j1jeaaw,You okay in this cold snap? I‚Äôm saving to get a van and want to travel the USA. Im on disability so I have limited funds, but it can be done.
zuc3yj,,j1jq8hw,Yeah, I've got a canvas tent, wood stove, good cot, and sleeping bag and blankets. My twin stove top burner is 20,000 also. I've seen some really cool van set ups. Solar panels and all, but they're a bit pricey for me. I've been building up since Aug, and now I can afford to get what I need if I need it.
zuc3yj,,j1odkc1,Absolutely disgusting that any veteran is homeless. For the shit our men and women go through they should have guaranteed housing help after they are discharged.
zuc3yj,,j1onbx0,There's enough resources at the VA, problem is dealing with the markets. Most sellers don't want to pay for the inspection or appraisal, leaving it to the veteran to risk hundreds of dollars on a house they might not even get in the end.
zu6zq9,j1hnqyx,,It's too fucking cold. Wait till summer. I'm also homeless by choice and you really gotta just suck it up a few more months. Stay housed until spring or summer. Sorry to be rude but now is not the time to be reckless.
zu6zq9,j1ho7fx,,If you feel like a burden staying for free, then help with chores or making dinner or something to earn your keep. That kind of tit for tat is how you survive homelessness/couchsurfing.
zu6zq9,j1htpmn,,It's much colder outside.
zu6zq9,j1jn1av,,You'd be very lucky to find a shelter where you have privacy, peace, and few rude people; that is far from the norm. This would be a huge mistake; I strongly discourage it unless the people offering you housing are extremely and violently abusive.
zu6zq9,j1ikazs,,I slept on my cousin's couch for nine months until I could get established in my job and find a place. She had three boys, all under 13, and it was very loud and chaotic. I left the house a lot to get some peace and quiet. But ... I was sheltered, I could shower and do laundry, had access to a kitchen and food storage. I paid rent, helped with other household expenses, and did chores and errands. It wasn't fun, but it gave me stability to do my job and let me save up for my own place. Suck it up and move in with someone for a while. Sleeping in a living room is much better than sleeping on the street or in a shelter.
zu6zq9,j1id9x9,,Partly, the answer to your question depends on where you are, if you‚Äôre willing to migrate, and whether you have a vehicle to sleep in and can rely on not being repossessed, having current tags etc.

The cardboard is actually a pretty decent insulator. If you have a wool blanket, use that as your inner liner, then any other blankets that are puffy. Even thin blankets can be used to cover your head and feet. Wear layers of clothes and socks, especially wool socks. Make sure you wear any winter hats, that helps you feel warmer.
zu6fnp,,j1nbc94,Un,  It's not feasible for me to put cardboard in my car. It would make me an immediate target for the police and people that don't want us homeless around. I used a lot of layers of clothing and rocked my winter hat. I also slept with my arms folded and wrapped my feet with my laundry bag. More importantly, I was able to get fuel thanks to an angel \[truly, an angel\]. I thank goodness because I thought I would die in my vehicle from cold.  How about you friend?
zu6fnp,,j1nd67k,I'm being roasted, because I asked reddit what they would do with noisy neighbors. Instead of answering that question, they are going after me for having a "hoard", with pets, while being physically disabled and unable to rapidly unpack my belongings rapidly.  But I'm very happy that things worked out for you. I know fuel can be very hard to afford, and hopefully you will be able to get by on what you were provided.

zu4tqq,j1ibz6e,,In my city those hotels are in the scariest areas of town for a lady.
zu4tqq,,j1io1lb,What city? This is the same for Winnipeg and same for Regina the capital of Saskatchewan as well. I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs an issue in a lot or all Of these places. Honestly if I were to go this route I‚Äôd be finding a small town nearby from where I‚Äôm working that has a Motel or hotel by a restaurant or bar,  or in a small city that doesn‚Äôt have lots of tourism finding a place. I imagine all big cities they are mostly/all rough in. The hotels or motel out of a big city will be cheaper, won‚Äôt have the dirty degenerates from the big city, and will be more peaceful Of course if you have to drive to and from work the gas costs transporting should be taken into account but still I‚Äôd rather lose an extra 20-60$ a week on gas(which you‚Äôd surely save or more on a more rural,less urban areas hotel/motel) then deal with the threat of crime violence, theft and bed bugs(and since you are a female, sexual assault and rape.  In Fact an old guy in my area that I used to visit And try to cheer up came from a hotel Across the city from where my old coworker stayed in hotels. He brought bed bugs with him to his new apartment from The hotel he was living in. And he told no one and acted like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal so now nobody talks to Him.
zu4tqq,,j1ire78,Austin texas. Because of how I look or dress I'm assumed to be looking for sex or drugs. Even a tank top shows a lot of cleavage. I just can't be left alone. Go to the corner store, or even smoke weed.   I mean, I like being comfortable, I like how I look but depending on the guy I am accused of being trans, or just gay and that can be dangerous.   Which is why I stay in the neighborhood I grew up in, way too expensive but I don't get harassed as much.
zu4tqq,,j1isbxb,I guess you were given larger than average chest build so tough to hide it?  And yeah I can‚Äôt stay in the super nice neighborhoods no stores or places to warm up and they are NIMBY‚Äôs but I did leave the north end here for a better area for my peace and it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve regretted.

zu4tqq,,j1hbljg,You might want to look for a room for rent short term from an individual, I can't remember what they call the other places that are basically a room for rent with shared privileges for common areas.  They aren't great but usually pretty cheap.

zu4tqq,,j1kkvtq,So true.  What I'm dealing with now
zu4tqq,j1hfee8,,depends on what you mean by cheap. probably best you can find in a more urban area is still gonna be like $1000-1200 a month. so if you‚Äôre working full time it‚Äôs doable but maybe not with additional expenses. might be able to find cheaper spots on craigslist, like an individual renting out a room short-term. could find something as low as like $300-600. i‚Äôve also seen things like little trailers (no heat, water or power) for like $75 a month.
zu4tqq,j1hr7mq,,Cheaper through booking services online in many cases
zu4tqq,j1in50a,,I can say they are in Winnipeg. But for example if you don‚Äôt want to stay in a shelter, the places in Winnipeg at least that rent hotel rooms long term are NOWHERE you want to be. They are all in rough ends of the city and only Used as hotels because the hotels need money and can‚Äôt get regular customers so they rent to low income and criminals. They have criminals, druggies bed bugs vermin etc just like a shelter but  They have less sanitation and less security because it‚Äôs not a government funded shelter, it‚Äôs just a broke hotel who has to rent to people needing a place to live, so they are cheap and can‚Äôt afford any security despite usually renting to a very rough crowd demographic.  When I was in high school one guy I worked with landscaping in summers lived that way for years and liked the convenience of being able to go to a bar and restaurant in one building that he was already home at, he saw lots of shit at that bar and switched hotels after having the restaurant food make him sick and seeing mice in The dining room/kitchen Those were his final straws. Didn‚Äôt have that issue with restaurant at next hotel he went to, but he eventually rented a room in a house once he could because it was still rough.
zu4tqq,j1izebi,,I know you don't want to sleep in your car, but hear me out. Consider the costs of a weekly stay for a month vs what you would spend to insulate and warm your car. What if that month becomes extended for whatever reason?   I have been in this situation and found that the weekly stays were not only painfully expensive but also in the worst locations. I happily spent money on insulating my car and went that route for what I had anticipated would be 2 maybe 3 weeks. The deal fell through and it became months with no end in sight. I can without a doubt say I made the right decision to take that route even though to everyone else it seemed crazy.
zu4tqq,j1jcpst,,From what I noticed in the location I am in. The only time I see somewhat "afforadble" motels are when you go in towns/cities that not a plethora of individuals are locating too. The places that are not known for tourism, or have a booming industry of some sort. But this comes off with a significant trade off because most of the times (from my experience and observations) these places lack sufficient opportuntites and resources because of a lack of individuals coming into these places.    It is somewhat of a no win situation in certain places.   Motels in these places are also rising over the past year alone. I had a coworker at a former job in May of this year who was living in a local motel who raised their prices from approximately $750ish per month, to around $900ish I believe. It is insane because just several years ago, you could have rented motels in my hometown for only $650ish a month.   For example, if you live in a big city such as Seattle, then the motel prices will be off the charts. But if you live somewhere like Mount Pleasant MI a place where not many people know of, the motel prices would be significantly lower than in bigger cities, however the lack of opportuntities there is possibly why people do not go to towns such as that.

zu21ok,j1i208y,,I think the most helpful think you can do is to get to know one unhoused individual. Sit down with them where they are or invite them to meet you for lunch or coffee (if you‚Äôre a bit wary and want others around). Ask them what would be helpful - clothes? Shoes? A gas card? Help getting an ID? Or if you sense that they have untreated mental illness or addiction, research places that can help and if they are willing, help them jump through the administrative hoops to access those resources. If they are unwilling, try to continue to develop a friendship with them. Be a support, a person they can talk to, and someone they can go to when they are ready to move forward. Definitely set boundaries (never give anyone cash), and be discerning as to who you give rides to. But I would say that one of the main causes of homelessness is isolation from healthy family, friends and folks who can help - and we can all work to do something about that üôÇ.
zu21ok,j1gx62r,,Coffee helps. Donations help. It's on the individual what they want to carry with them. If you feel the desire to help, help.

zu21ok,j1kx27h,,You‚Äôre on the right track and asking good questions.  I suppose it‚Äôs different for everyone: time, schedule, safety, area, what resources are available, who‚Äôs with you etc.  I‚Äôm middle aged, unhealthy, small male. Still, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs easy to cause someone to panic if you approach them‚Ä¶so I don‚Äôt do that anymore.   You just don‚Äôt know what someone has been through and in hindsight after being on here‚Ä¶enough‚Ä¶pretty sure the guy got his stuff stolen from him recently, which would explain why he was carrying what little he had in his shirt.   Pretty much I just kinda let things unfold as natural as possible. I‚Äôll give a warm greeting and what not and sometimes a conversation follows, sometimes not.  If you end up talking, you get a chance to ask what is needed and if you can bring it by or in some cases drop it safely.
zu21ok,j1lqbdm,,Your heart is definitely in the right place, particularly this being Christmas and all. When I (42 year old man with cerebral palsy) used to work for a homeless services organization, I certainly could have been taken advantage of, even as it was my city; an area I am all too familiar with. The fact that I wasn't meant two things to me: first, that the homeless human beings that I encountered were appreciative of my assistance and 2: realize that had taken advantage of me, they may not have been helped as they were.  I said all of that to say that homeless individuals do get a bad rap; most are just trying to get by, like you and I. The difference being that the streets are tough: That's where the development of "street smarts" comes in.  Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen or something. And you might find out that a large contingent of that population hangs out at the local McDonald's or the local library at around this or that time. Maybe you bring your boyfriend along. So you go to the library and find a way to strategically Introduce yourself. I say it's strategically, because you need to be safe and careful. But once you've got an "in," just talking about their experience is helpful. They want to be seen, just like everybody else. All of this is predicted on your own personal safety being paramount. If you don't feel safe, you might want to try a different approach.

ztz5x6,j1gk1bc,,I hand out handwarmers doing outreach, and it's my most requested item. That and emergency blankets. People really need and appreciate them. I usually get several boxes either donated or I buy them in bulk every month, along with passing them out, I take a bunch to the local low income clinic, and two church's with free boxes outside their building.  I just wish there was more I could do, like advocate to the city to get more shelter options available, because up til recently, there were no shelters whatsoever here
ztz5x6,j1imgl1,,Good to know what homeless needs most.
ztz5x6,,j1kmigm,Socks. Don't get the cheapest ones, because they're thin and not at all durable. But don't go crazy and get really expensive ones, either; better six pairs of good-enough socks than one or two pairs of fancy ones.  Given the limits to how much stuff I can have, I often wear the same clothes for a few days. But I change my socks at least once a day.
zty42w,j1g16b9,,This breaks my heart. Isn't there a place that is open 24 hours or a warm center near you?
zty42w,,j1g1e8v,Everything is just far I can barely walk a few feet without feeling like I'm gonna pass out and my muscles failing
zty42w,,j1g1key,Call paramedics.
zty42w,,j1h5ph7,Dude I second this call an ambulance now ! Go sit in the er lobby they will Under stand
zty42w,,j1g2061,I'm sleeping in my car that's about to be repossessed soon anyway I leave it and it gets towed.....and I have no money or means to get it back
zty42w,,j1g26tj,Ask for gas at the station to run your heat
zty42w,,j1g2gp8,Lmao you know I'm in Connecticut...right? This area is unfriendly. I have had cops called on me for sleeping in my car three times
zty42w,,j1g2m6p,Ask in assistance sub for gas money
zty42w,,j1g3h5s,Assistance sub?
zty42w,,j1g3uta,r/assistance
zty42w,,j1g42rn,Thank you!
zty42w,,j1h6g5f,Try at least hey
zty42w,,j1h7p5w,Hey
zty42w,,j1kgdqg,Go to the hospital and tell them you‚Äôre having chest pain
zty42w,j1gclu1,,You need to get a bus ticket as far south as possible. At least you'll be warm for awhile, and when you have to depart, it won't be as cold, and they'll probably take better care of you.
zty42w,,j1gcvh9,That's a great idea but I don't even have $5 and  no friends or family to ask for money
zty42w,,j1j9yqa,Sell your car, take a bus to somewhere with a shelter. Or else soon, you'll have no car in a very cold state with no shelter, and then you literally will freeze to death
zty42w,,j1ggaqe,What can you do? Physically? Can you cook?
zty42w,,j1ghkjw,When I had shelter I had food I could prepare quick in a microwave or I'll sit and cook on my electric burner. Later I would feel worse and can't move sometimes up to 3 days. Showering, walking etc  is a struggle
zty42w,,j1ghsei,What is your condition causing this?
zty42w,,j1gj5nd,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

zty42w,,j1i73ve,Getting approved for disability is difficult at best, and takes 8+ months minimum, assuming you're approved the first time, which is rare, and also requires you have an address to receive paperwork at. Thank you for being thoughtful. The last time I mentioned disabled on reddit, I was just told repeatedly that I was abusing the system.
zty42w,,j1gkhe6,...uhm...ok... Cocaine? Maybe...  Jk... Damn...
zty42w,,j1hoi9n,Wrong thread to be making a joke dude. This dude is worried about dying he doesn‚Äôt have time to joke around with you lol
zty42w,,j1iltdi,Ik, ik...
zty42w,,j2ppzeb,He‚Äôs got nothing but time actually
zty42w,,j2pqha7,If you are so physically disabled as you say then why aren‚Äôt you on disability? If you had as much difficulty as you say and go to doctors so much then why don‚Äôt they have proof you can go get on disability for.  How can you be so disabled you can‚Äôt move and def can‚Äôt work (in your words) but not disabled enough that you can receive disability support?
zty42w,,j2pqybf,Disability takes months to get approved it's a process....come on now! I thought everyone knew that
zty42w,,j2ptef5,Yeh but how long have you been disabled for?
zty42w,,j2ptm2b,I got my official diagnosis a few months ago
zty42w,j1h5mv1,,Bro walk somewhere now dude . Walk to the precinct , the ER go somewhere warm even if you have to force it dude . It‚Äôs 15 degrees here in coastal Virginia . GET OUT THE COLD NOW BY ANY MEANS DUDE . Start a fire if you have to man . I‚Äôm praying for you brother or sister !
zty42w,j1gasc4,,Can you find a way to get to Phoenix, AZ? It‚Äôs never cold enough to freeze here. There is always room at the shelters, they suck but their is always space.
zty42w,,j1gba6j,Hell yeah if I had the funds I wouldn't be in this cold state.....warm weather improves my health condition so I might be able to get consistent funds. But I'll have to push my body and book a flight but then no money
zty42w,,j1gcasf,I was in an abusive relationship, I called 911, I didn‚Äôt press charges I just asked the cops to take me to the DV shelter. Some charity called Wings of Angels paid for my plane ticket to come here. Then I stayed in the woman‚Äôs shelter,  they gave me a bus pass then I got a job and the shelter paid my rental deposit. I got lucky. I‚Äôm doing really good now. There are jobs in Phoenix. Employers are desperate for employees who will show up. It‚Äôs really nice in Phoenix.
zty42w,,j1gcqqk,I'm really sorry you had to go through that. A cop came to check on me just to give me false hope and never came back
zty42w,,j2pr9or,Did you hear anything that u/IronicBunny said? Listen to their suggestions at all?  As for the cop he probably gave you suggestions (like everyone else on this sub) that you constantly shut down,so he probably didn‚Äôt bother coming back to you bc there‚Äôs no reason to-you don‚Äôt accept any suggestions,ideas or anything anyone has to say so yeh he probably gave up.
zty42w,,j2prrhx,Bro can you pls back off my post....how ignorant are you? Cops don't provide shelter for citizens
zty42w,j1hggx1,,There are two gudjuwaras in Connecticut. They have phone numbers and it's likely they'd help you stay warm and fed, including getting there and parking up, because that's their thing. It's one avenue of help that you haven't mentioned yet, so...  Any non-leaking container that you can fill with hot water and wrap in a towel is a survival tool. Also, if you can get paper, crumple it up and shove it inside your shoes and clothes. Keep your head covered at all times. Wearing a mask will warm the air that you're breathing in, so you lose less. Keep hydrated. You need nearly as much water as if it was really hot - keep your urine straw-coloured, not too pale (or you'll go more often and lose more heat). You need that water to burn fat to stay warm. You also need any calories you can get.  Beg people for coffee, not money for coffee. Hot drinks will also help you keep alive. Ask for hot water too, to fill whatever you're using as a hot water bottle. You probably look like shit with the health problems and anxiety, so nobody is going to want to give cash the way they will if you look healthier, which is just the catch-22 you're stuck in.  However much you can move without collapsing entirely, move that much. If you start shivering and can't get under more cover/insulation you have, then you don't have long left to live and you can either die in your car or ditch it for the ER to not, you know, die. So get mentally ready for life getting even worse than it already did. Let's hope it doesn't.
zty42w,j1h46um,,Have you gone to a church?  Large ones are open 24 hours, and they have a duty to the poor
zty42w,j1g2r6p,,Call 911 tell them you are suicidal or something.   At least you will be warm in a hospital.
zty42w,,j1g34vd,Tried that before all they did is threatened to put me on meds that they made sure I took and lock in a mental facility. Before that they drained a lot of blood out of me and  after everything come out clean they told me I had to leave.....I was left stranded so that wouldn't work
zty42w,,j1g5kdv,Well at least you would have some warmth for a while.  Idk maybe you need to say different things.  I always ended up in the hospital after saying im gonna kill myself.  Maybe you need to cut yourself a little.   Sorry to say that. Its fucked up but hey you cant just freeze to death.
zty42w,,j1g68bm,Warmth while being locked with people who wanna rip your head off and forced to take meds you really don't need. If I cut myself they restrain me (handcuffs you name it all). No showers, you piss and crap on yourself they don't care. That won't work honestly
zty42w,,j1ijgyq,Don‚Äôt cut yourself wth. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hospitals by law have to take you in‚Ä¶ go to the hospital for your health issues and while you‚Äôre there tell them you need resources ASAP so that you don‚Äôt freeze to death. They can likely find you some kind of alternative.
zty42w,,j1ik51i,Thanks for the tip! You're right about cutting yourself part. Not a great idea
zty42w,,j1g98rq,[deleted]
zty42w,,j1g9zsl,That's not gonna help my situation.... I'm honestly trying to make this better not make my health condition worse. Doctors orders stay away from all that. Also I would lose my spots on housing and shelter waitlists
zty42w,,j1g7wz9,That won't work around here
zty42w,,j1ji14n,This is a great idea it will work, been thinking about doing it myself
zty42w,j1vwnth,,This is capitalism. I just saw that many froze to death in Buffalo but, the msm is only counting deaths not saying how the narcissism and cruelty of this system is responsible.  They hide the deaths and real reasons for them.  Homeless are going to die enmasse as even the system supposedly to help the homeless is middlemen consultants and those scumbags peeling off much of the tiny available funds to enrich themselves.  This system is broken and killing its citizens while sending money for their war overseas and pretending to have done everything they can.  Pure Evil.    Im sorry we as a country are too narcissistic to do more than pray.  The lack of actual empathy mixed with apathy and the desperation of the rest too destroyed to even attempt to help anyone else is growing.   We normalized narcissism part is that we wont acknowledge problems until they hit us and then there is no one to help us. Even the narcissism of the masses is very much from being victimized by a predatory system of greed.  The narcissism begets more narcissism.   Weve failed as a country and have just begun the decent. Im sorry we failed you.
zty42w,,j1vx6o0,I was about to say that!! It‚Äôs very unfortunate people are dying out there
zty42w,j1i7o9s,,I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm kind of in the same boat. I have a job but all my paycheck just goes too hotel rooms!! Once my stay is gone I might freeze too death
zty42w,,j1igb2a,Omg I hope things get better and don't have to deal with that
zty42w,j1glw92,,I lived outside the last 2 winters in Canada. It's very doable. You need the gear though. You NEED a winter sleeping bag. That's it. It IS doable, just not easy. Good luck buddy.  Edit: I wrote my advice before reading the comments. People, living outside in the winter is very doable. Fuck, every homeless person in  Canada does it. Not easy, but very doable.
zty42w,,j1gqb1t,Yes, it's about the right tools for your situation.  I was without a dwelling for over a year in interior Alaska. The arctic sleeping bag is important, proper layers, tarps, wind breaks, tent  etc . But is it possible for OP to get a sub zero bag and good tent?
zty42w,,j1imz8a,I was very lucky to live in a place with a ton of homeless support. I once had my sleeping bag stolen, I left it for like a minute. I got a better one from the local shelter within a day. People here help a lot. Kept me going. Just been off the street for a month. Very grateful I am, the system actually helped me. I will forever care about the homeless though. My friends are still on the street.
zty42w,,j1gomco,I'm so sorry you have to deal with that
zty42w,j1hdhuz,,There's other forums on reddit for people who're straight up just asking for money, which is what this is.  You're getting to the point you're being openly hostile to any advice, and there's many solutions that will work, at least well enough to get you through the night.    &#x200B;  Also, you DO have to have some sense when you're homeless, you can't wait until you're in an extremely dangerous situation to be planning your move.  You should, barest minimum, have an appropriate sleeping bag, winter clothing, and blankets for the situation.    It sounds like you have a car so you should have been panhandling to get your ass either to Florida, South Arizona, or South Cali \*MONTHS AGO\*!  I'm aware that you're overdue on car payment and insurance payment, but still getting somewhere warm should take high priority over everything else.    &#x200B;  I've watched you go from indifferent reasons to why these ideas won't work, to hostile about why these ideas won't work, all the way to OPENLY hostile about why these ideas won't work and saying that "money is the only the solution".  You're begging.  And the general tone sounds a lot like begging to feed a severe drug addiction.  You think us people who've done time homeless haven't seen that before?  It's pretty obvious once you've seen it a few times.  Go to the crowdfund or assistance forums.  Be more polite and more grateful on them.  You go using this tone and no one will give you a damn thing because you're sounding like a crackhead who needs a rock.  &#x200B;  If you aren't begging for a fix, I apologize for saying that, but you can't wait until the deep cold to leave cold frozen winter states.  You should have got somewhere warm by early November.  Poor planning when you're homeless, can and will, result in death.  You're gonna have to be smarter about things.
zty42w,,j1hrp77,I second your opinion. OP's tone is just... something is off. The only time OP had anything nice to say was when they mentioned someone gave them money on r/mustang. Big red flag there. Seems like OP is getting frustrated that people are handing out advice instead of cash app. It's literally the first rule of this sub, do not give ppl money here. I'm not sure about it being for drugs tho.  All that being said, is this really how bad the services are in the US? I'm homeless in Canada. This is my 2nd month. I have a bed that's reserved for me as long as I show up by a certain time. There is at least 1 meal a day from the churches. The shelter usually does a light snack for breakfast. Donated clothes. Donated toiletries. I get a small stipend from the province. Housing in about 6 months. Applying for disability.  If this is the typical situation in the US, I'm really sorry you have to go through that. Take care everyone.
zty42w,,j1hxmyg,It depends on where you are in the nation how good the service will be to the homeless.  In some areas (usually Republican controlled areas), help is virtually non existent.  Some areas have a fairly extensive help network, which also results in attracting much more homeless in that region.  Though I don't know anywhere in the US that sounds quite as good as what you have.  I don't know of any \*safe\* (key word) shelters that just has a reserved bed every night ready to go.    &#x200B;  It sounds like OP is in a particularly bad area for government help for the homeless.  It also sounds to me like she has exhausted all her friends/relatives who will lend her money (people are always much more eager to help homeless women than men, that's why you see far less homeless women).  So since she's not used to the hoops you have to jump through to get help from the government and charities, she's just asking for money.  If she wants to be homeless, for long, she's gonna have to move somewhere warm where the government helps the homeless more.  South California is a popular choice.  South Arizona as well.
zty42w,,j1j1frw,CT is one of the richest states in the nation. As in, most of the people that live there makes an income above a certain amount. It might be stereotypical...but I never associated rich people with being kind to the homeless.
zty42w,,j1isa6b,I get it. But when it comes to this point then I told you so isn‚Äôt going to help the situation. Either you are helping or not, OP doesn‚Äôt need to hear it I am sure..
zty42w,j1h3sl8,,This is another thread where the OP is going to argue with every advice offered....
zty42w,,j1h6v11,WTF do these type of people want??????!!! EVERY SINGLE FUCKN IDEA OFFERED they have a fucking excuse to not do it. They literally just shoot the commentator down with negative BS and sarcasm.   The only thing OP wants  to hear is ‚ÄúOh hey OP wants your cashapp I‚Äôll send you money‚Äù üôÑüôÑ  They don‚Äôt want to do anything,try anything,work towards anything, fuckn attempt anything. And STILL people are being kind and trying to offer advice!? I just can‚Äôt with people like this, their situation will never ever change bc they can‚Äôt be fucked to.
zty42w,,j1h7vfy,NONE OF THESE IDEAS WORK!!! I've been in the same situation, and heard the same obvious, nonsense advice. He's looking for help, because he's freezing to death - why are you attacking him??
zty42w,,j1h9o04,  Exactly.
zty42w,,j1hcsqd,NONSENSE advice? That‚Äôs your take away from all the different ideas people have shared?  I know I shouldn‚Äôt bother wasting my time with this reply when you are clearly either delusional or straight up stupid but the irony is just so fucking silly to me.   Idk what tickles me more. The fact you‚Äôre tryin to talk shit to people trying to help OP or that your comment is quite possibly the most WORTHLESS possible reply possible seeing as you offered absolutely zero advice yourself .   OP clearly is convinced money is the only possible solution to this problem of ‚Äúfreezing to death.‚Äù You gonna help with that then?? or just bitch at people trying to help? Stay worthless.
zty42w,,j2qnkqc,Of course your comment is downvoted..anything that‚Äôs realistic and not fawning over OP is downvoted and upsets everyone. I can‚Äôt believe people trying to say all the ideas offered are useless-so many people offering good genuine advice that would help OP,but noooooo none of it is helpful..?! Fuck me..it makes me think these people want a majic fuckn genie to ride in on their carpet and shower them with money and gifts and a home etc,bc they can‚Äôt possibly do it themselves‚Ä¶
zty42w,,j3qtq4f,Keep in mind, instead of trying to help themselves. OP is sitting on Reddit, complaining crying and taking no advice. Doesn‚Äôt seem like much of a worthful cause to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  ‚ÄúShe don‚Äôt wanna be saved, don‚Äôt save her‚Äù - J Cole best fitting statement I think for this post
zty42w,,j2qnatb,Then what should OP do mate?? You and him literally said Nothing Works!?!? So what do they do then lol,just live like they are and slowly fuckn die in their car? No ideas work üòÇ well then guess they are shit outta luck and just have to accept their lot in life hey ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  And I‚Äôm not attacking them champ,and I‚Äôm not the only one that thinks what I‚Äôve written-most people don‚Äôt want to say it bc they get accused of attacking people;just like you have me.
zty42w,,j1ha8od,I‚Äôm happy for you that you obviously haven‚Äôt been in the same situation as OP. This is a cry for help and I pray to all the gods that they will find the necessary shelter, help and care they so desperately need - and then some.   Please don‚Äôt react like this. If you don‚Äôt understand, try to learn more about the matter. How does your comment help OP? Kicking someone when they‚Äôre down is not cute.
zty42w,,j1hb8rb,They just don't get it.I literally keep repeating myself.....even the cops were unable to help me because no available resources
zty42w,,j1hb18u,Have you bothered reading the comments it's pretty clear. The state has no enough resources and private organizations need more funding. If you think I'm making excuses why do you think we still have over 90,000 homeless people JUST in LA? because the government can't help everyone without adequate funding...
zty42w,,j1hl70u,What were you doing before to pay your car note?
zty42w,,j1irolz,It‚Äôs crazy how people think that just saying something that makes sense to them is going to work. Listen it‚Äôs so hard. Sometimes you are caught up in a predicament and there is no way out. I am a hard working person who did very well for 40+ years until this year and this fall season. I am out here screwed screaming for help! People just don‚Äôt understand that it‚Äôs not going to happen, not everyone is friendly. Personally I am trying to survive till I get to my next job. But please don‚Äôt berate me or anyone for getting put in this situation. It‚Äôs so freaking cold out and so freaking frustrating!! OP I take it one hour at a time. Stay positive and most importantly stay warm!!!
zty42w,,j1itp93,I hope things get better for you! Me too I worked myself so hard. I went to school and worked at the same time until illness came creeping in. I tried pushing through but all I did is make it worse. The next thing is I'm in the emergency room and from there things started to fall apart. I like earning my money but when your body shuts down it needs time to recover but life doesn't care about that
zty42w,,j1iqbyl,move to Ukraine?  (jking OP)  I hope you find some shelter...it's Xmas and all...I can hear Scrooge whining now about his 'taxes'  All the best to you ~
zty42w,j1joprw,,Imo hypothermia is a nice way to go.  Whats worse is losing fingers and toes due to frostbite.  There was a homeless lady who got both her feet amputated due to frostbite.  Life after that is much worse than just falling asleep forever from hypothermia. Just my opinion.  Do whatever you need to do to keep your extremities warm.
zty42w,j1gcww0,,There are churches everywhere and they are all open this time of year! Go see if they really mean what they preach
zty42w,,j1gdv9o,Unfortunately they are behind on funds.... Connecticut wasn't prepared for high raise in homelessness
zty42w,,j1izf46,‚ÄúGo see if they really mean what they preach‚Äù this is the actual answer. Don‚Äôt call them, show up. Find a church in your area, go to Sunday service. Leave your pride at the door. A Unitarian service would be my choice‚Ä¶  Christmas falls on a Sunday this year, so there‚Äôs a pretty good chance church‚Äôs will be serving a potluck lunch. You should be able to find this out by looking at the church‚Äôs calendar online. Humbly stand up in front of the congregation and explain to them your situation. Churches themselves may be low on funding, but the entire body of the church is not.   The shame of not helping you in an open forum, will overwhelm any reservations about not providing you assistance. Trust me this will work. If it doesn‚Äôt, got to an evening service at a different religious Organization. - Best to you.
zty42w,j1gsqff,,Can you get yourself to the emergency department at a hospital? Where I live,  they let people sleep in the waiting room when it's very cold.  If you go to the police department and flat out ask for help,  would they help? Maybe someone would let you hang out until morning at least? I was without any place to stay temporarily in Elyria Ohio for about a week one winter and the police let me hang out and drink coffee when I got too cold, but you really have to ask and beg, because they're obviously not comfortable doing it. As another commenter said, you really need a winter sleeping bag.  I slept out in negative 40 F temperatures in that. It was not cheap though.   Can you panhandle the funds or approach a church, Salvation Army, or a charity to get equipment? If you find yourself with the choice again,  do not, not, not  waste money on motels. They're not worth it unless you have a good job l lined up.  Spend it on survival gear. You'll be okay anywhere if you can just get that. Also are you working with a doctor or community health center? Are you incapable of working at any job at all?  What about SSDI?
zty42w,,j1gtmxt,The problem with Connecticut is the state is super disorganized.... everything is very far down the highway and you have to rely on a vehicle to get anywhere. A bus takes 2 hrs+ I have no funds and have so many past due payments and some banks have gone to the point of permanently restricting me for overdrafting. Yes my symptoms are so severe I struggle to eat, brush teeth etc. I have nothing left
zty42w,,j1h43vd,It sounds like it's time to leave that place, but to do that,  you need to stay alive and you need funds. Please seek out any public place you can to get out of the cold. The Red Cross has warming centers during really harsh times. But you need money too. If Doordash is out, can you make content on your phone? Videos, blogs, a video journal on YouTube about your life and what you're going through? Enough subscribers could turn everything around for you.  Collect donations via PayPal? Could you get a Patreon account? Heck, I might even do foot fetish videos if I really needed the money! When I was in my 20s I worked as a life drawing model at a community college to make ends meet and from there l got a lot of local artists as clients, who paid cash each session. I won't say it was easy money, but it's a venerable old job and I was rather proud to see some of the work that came from it. For that, I literally just walked in and gave the woman who ran the art department my name and number. Best go through someone like that and stay safe- don't Craigslist it or anything like that! It's not for everyone,  but if you don't mind being nude for art, it can keep you alive. Not sure if you can donate plasma or not, but a number of folks on here do that to get fast cash. The key thing is finding strength from somewhere, finding out what you can offer,  and not giving up. You never know what's next or how your life might change. Good luck.
zty42w,,j1h4itm,Thanks a lot that was helpful! With my illness everyone I knew abandoned me. Family doesn't care if I'm outside, partner and friends walking away. Thank you for believing in me

zty42w,,j1hkhtc,I am, and it's unfortunate so many people (like some commenting here) put up roadblocks. I've asked for help countless times, and there are always people like this. I'm not sure if their denial doesn't allow them to conceive of someone being homeless due to circumstances beyond their control, or if they're just threatened knowing they couldn't compete on a level playing field.
zty42w,j1hajqz,,For real! I really hope people who are claiming I'm making excuses never have to go through this. I have contacted 211, been to Social Services, Churches and believe me or not shelters are by referral only in Connecticut. Connecticut was caught by surprise how many people become homeless due to inflation. The state wasn't prepared and they are in panic mode. And to add insult to injury I'm dealing with a chronic illness that makes even walking difficult, can't eat for days sometimes. I'm sorry if I'm frustrating you all but my body can barely handle doing the basic stuff. I'm not making excuses I'm just dealing with all these without family or family backup..

zty42w,,j1it746,Honestly 211 doesn‚Äôt work all the time. It didn‚Äôt work for me. The exact words were that the shelters around me were closed. Just being completely honest.
zty42w,j1gzx26,,Hey man. I am sorry for what you are going through. My suggestion is to call around to local churches. Ask if they can help or know how to get some help.      You would be surprised what these can do for you sometimes.
zty42w,j1h3p2f,,This is why most homeless are seasonal snowbirds.  If you don't have a job tying you to that area, I'd get a greyhound bus down to Phoenix, Tucson, or South Coastal California.  &#x200B;  Staying in Connecticut is a death wish.  You should have gotten to where the weather is survivable outdoors before it ever got this cold.
zty42w,j1i56iv,,Have you thought about going to jail? Sounds bad but you‚Äôd have shelter, 3 meals a day, & medication. With your condition it sounds like you‚Äôre going to perish very soon so this could be your last resort.
zty42w,,j1iiyfy,You might be  right about the perish very soon part. I feel awful health wise. About going to jail honestly I thought you were joking
zty42w,,j1ilmx4,Not joking , if it‚Äôs life or death like you claim it is , going to jail is a no brainer for me. Just go to a gas station and hold it up at knife point and wait for the cops.
zty42w,,j1j2jwt,There's probably an easier way to go to jail and not be charged with as bad of a crime. Tell the cops you murdered somebody and they have to investigate and keep you in jail in the meantime. At worst they'll charge you with filing a false police report instead of threatening somebody with a knife. Bet you could even call 911 and have them pick you up and take you to the station.
zty42w,,j1itr8u,Lol honestly I have thought of this..

zty42w,,j1hn71n,Steal a sleeping bag. Walmart won't prosecute until you hit feloney limit. Then go to ER parking lot, either park there in the back or go inside and explain.  Also, call the dealership and explain. I doubt anyone will be repo-in tonight much less from a hospital.
zty42w,j1gx193,,If you literally have no funds at all you may literally have to ask someone for a bit of money so that you can get the bus or whatever you need to do.  You could also set up a go fund me.  Sorry I can't be of more help OP

zty42w,,j1io24e,Yes indeed! She evaluated me and said I wasn't too bad to be admitted but she Hooked me up with a social worker who put me in affordable housing waitlists. Maybe I should try again and it might accelerate the process
zty42w,,j1iuw4t,Stay in constant contact with your social worker. The wait-list in some areas can be really long, like 5+ years. I don't know what it's like in your area though. You have to be proactive. Find out what documents you need to submit and get started immediately. Ask for clothing, food pantries, anything available.  Social worker are overloaded with work and they'll forget about you if you don't follow up on your application.  Call 211 for additional help. Are you a female? You might have luck getting into a women's shelter.
zty42w,,j1iw14i,Thank you for believing me! Some people thought I was lying about the waitlists
zty42w,,j1ix9nt,Are you by chance a veteran?  I understand because I work with people trying to get them into housing. It's a lot more difficult than people think. I wish there was an easy way to do it.
zty42w,,j1irp6t,idk if you would ever do it but what if you actually did some sort of self harm...cutting yourself or burning yourself or something that actually looks like you were indeed trying to kill your sell but but not too much that you actually hurt yourself

zty42w,,j1iwp8f,I would suggest not lying to the healthcare staff. They have tests for all this that can't be faked. The only way they'll put you on a hold is if they determine you are a threat to yourself or others and have the means to carry it out. Not to mention they'll end up forcing her to take a bunch of meds for a disease she doesn't have, who knows what effect that will have.

ztw1g1,j1fnonc,,If you can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt want to) overnight at a shelter, prepare a hobo nest if you can.   Get garbage bags and fill with leaves, straw, long grass. You can also use a tarp or even a large blanket if the leaves are dry.   Cardboard on the ground, bags of leaves on top, blanket on top of the bags. Build a nest on top of the blanket with your sleeping bag and other blankets.   Those bags of leaves are damn good insulation to keep you off the cold ground.
ztw1g1,,j1ibik7,I hate homeless shelters here. Exactly like jail. No privacy, shared showers. Bunk beds, the salvation army here doesn't even have doors on the stalls.  One in Boise made everyone stand in line naked to shower, then wear pajamas. They didn't say that. I wasn't looking like a girl that first day and didn't know showering was mandatory.   So i had to refuse, and they made a fuss because they didn't believe I have both down there and they thought no one would try anything with everyone staring. Little did they understand how I looked and how popular I got in showers. The only other shelter available, accommodating women required $3 a night and was no different than a jail dorm style. 3 kinda sucks if you're not working yet, and they were hard on panhandling especially if you looked like me.
ztw1g1,,j1gufho,How do you carry/keep blankets, and keep them dry?
ztw1g1,,j1i9o3h,Neatly in plastic, if rained on then spread out soon. Depending on situation.
ztw1g1,,j1h317v,That‚Äôs a very good question. I can think of several methods, but let‚Äôs be honest - you‚Äôre probably not going to be carrying them further than the Salvation Army to your safe spot, right?

zts1tk,j1fm9ar,,I became homeless bc I prioritized gaming over work. I was a god online and loved by all my friends but irl I was a lonely loser that ppl avoided. When it came to which life was more important, it was clearly obvious at the time.  I would call out of work, skip bills including rent. When I began to c homelessness in the near future because I was getting evicted, it was too late to change. I sold my gaming setup and I‚Äôve been living in my car for almost 2 months now and this is something i needed. Unfortunately this happened bc I never got the chance to play the new CoD MW2 lol but I really needed this push.
zts1tk,,j1g9ob2,This is exactly why I never got into gaming.  I knew I would become addicted to it.
zts1tk,,j1g8zst,I had to sell my ps5 to my brother so I could make rent when my financial problems (that led to my homelessness) started and now I can‚Äôt play the new God of War, so I partially feel your pain my dude.

zts1tk,,j369r0v,Yeah I was once addicted to a couple PC games. After I finally got sick of it and my PC was ready to be replaced I got a Macbook and didn't buy the v2 of those games.   Some games are designed so damn well and can really suck you in. Not good. I view it as a type of unintentional mind control really. I don't think the gaming companies are trying to ruin people's lives, they're just trying to make really fun and sticky games, but they become addicting and anything addicting will suck your time away from your personal goals.

When it came time to transfer my voucher between states, my caseworker simply didn't do her job and I lost the apartment I'd been approved for (and paid the deposit on).  My low credit score, low income (ssi), and need for a wheelchair accessible apartment has kept me homeless for 7 months.  In Oct I was supposed to move into an apartment, but hurricane Ian shut the housing authority down for a week and someone sabotaged my internet access, so I lost the apartment.   I've finally been approved for another apartment, but I'm struggling to raise enough money for move in costs, which are around 2k. On social security, I'm not even supposed to have over 2k.
zts1tk,j1goh6j,,After 6 years in The Army and being Honorably Discharged at 22 years old, living at home with my parents didn't feel right. I was working, bit it still didn't feel right. I was missing something, I was also getting high, New York City, The Bronx...Crack.      I would go home an hour before I had to leave for work and get ready. After work, right back out there doing it all over again. Then I stopped going home, and going straight in to work, then no going to work and just being out there on the streets.      Went into shelters, work, shelters, my own place...and then back on the streets again. I knew what it was. The homeless people, me...we are a community. Most of us are kind and look out for each other and those who are just starting out on the streets. It was just like in The Army in a way.      This was happening to me off and on from 1988 to last year July when I came to where I am now. I had just came back to NYC from being out there...working...Rochester, NY, Charlotte , NC, Pittsburgh, PA...then NYC...The Pandemic. Just moved into a place from a shelter, but all work had shut down in Manhattan. 14 months on only Food Stamps, gained weigh. From 158 to 192. I wasn't active when I went back to work April 2021. My body broke down after the second morning when I woke up. I couldn't move. Called in to quit, rested... NYC isn't where I want to be. Childhood friend was where I am now, got a one way bus ticket, went into a shelter. Working 6 hours later off the bus. Working 10 months came back to the shelter.. Some people plus The Fed Govrn wanted to talk with me. Offered me HUD VASH, applied for early retirement. Now I do nothing all day but draw, learning to DJ, learning Adobe EVERYTHING.      I have had a job almost every year since 1972 and only wasn't working for 2 years. This is it, no more 18th chances given.  I think I've got it. Quiet town, SS check., SNAP, 2 food boxes a month and ACP internet.

zts1tk,j1h01nn,,I was screwed over by a friend who I had given damage deposit and rent to. They were taking my half of the rent and  as far as I knew they were paying the landlord. I was in between jobs because of health issues(cancer) and was only receiving disability. My roommate had stopped paying the landlord for about 6 months before I found out. They had been hiding the eviction notices from me. Refused to pay me back the rent I paid to them. I couldn't afford anything else so I just sort of ended up loosing a lot of belongings because my aunt was negligent with stuff she promised to let me keep at her house(she dropped off with my estranged father who did God knows what with it). Lost all my belongings a couple times just from visiting the hospital. Once I had a medical emergency on the train and the transit police didn't give my belongings to the paramedics that took me to the hospital. For some reason the cops emptied my pockets and backpack while I was unconscious. Second time I was sitting at the beach and saw someone snatch my bag and I tried chasing them to no avail.
zts1tk,j1fty3z,,I grew up religious, when I found out my church was a cult, I left and started living out of my car. That was 2 years ago, since then I have lived in peoples houses, couch hopped, and even got an apartment for a year with an abusive partner. Broke up with him in January, and broke the lease in April because he became increasingly violent to the point of threatening my life. Stayed with some friends for a few weeks, then built a bed in my car to go travel the country for the summer. Now I‚Äôm back home, finishing college. Still living in my car, and I sleep at friends on occasion, thankful for their small couch through this tough weather. Hell, I‚Äôd be grateful for a roof over my head and heat if I needed to sleep on the ground with no blankets or pillows. College costs a LOT cause I‚Äôm paying out of pocket, and I can‚Äôt afford an apartment. I also have debt racked up because of a skating incident a year ago, still paying off dental and hospital bills that totaled over 5k. I have a future ahead, and I gotta work towards it. But damn, being homeless is hard. Everything constantly aches. I sleep on a wooden pallet with a 1in mattress in my car. I can‚Äôt sit up comfortably and I‚Äôm constantly cramped. But I‚Äôd rather live like this than suffocated by abusive people around me. It‚Äôs also made me a lot more grateful for the things I do have, and hot meals. I‚Äôm also a lot more aware of fellow homeless, and make talk to the ones in my city on occasion, or give them rides to camp and back, and I often buy hot coffee for them when I wake up. It‚Äôs a sweet community in places, even if drugs are involved. Drugs don‚Äôt really make someone evil or bad like I used to think, but the addictive tendency can lead people to do shitty stuff. Personally, I stick to the non addictive organic drugs. :) anyways, I‚Äôm rambling. Hope that gives you a view into a life of a partial homeless person ig

zts1tk,j1gfjvb,,1st, I mod a reddit called HomelessHomebound, if your honest about ending homelessness, I need your help over there.  2nd, My homelessness is ultimately caused by child support deductions from my pay checks, and a couple levies when FL decided that wasn't enough.   The ultimate solution for anyone with child support payments is to become their own boss, but there's a smart way to do it right the 1st time, which is complicated, but effective. Trying to exist any other way is futile, or criminal.   I currently have a $20hr job, and still can't afford housing and the associated costs in and around PHX.   That's why I'm homeless.   My plan is to become a Loan Signing Agent, and a certified Home Inspector/Licensed Realtor, employed by an  owned by an S Corp, which I own. Why?  The  will hire me and pay me on Commission, which is subject to payroll deduction. All business taxes will pass through the  to the  owner, the S Corp, which is protected from any legal issues the employee/employer may encounter because of the . An S Corp keeps the business taxes seperate from the Individual taxes. I'll file one tax return for my earned commissions, before deductions, because that's how the IRS roles, and my S Corp will file separate taxes on the companies earned income and payroll. After a year, the S Corp can apply for a line of Corporate Business Credit, and then use that to obtain a company house and vehicle.  To protect this from a levy, which can possess anything you own, including your business (S Corp and it's products) you make a family member a silent co-owner. The levy can then only 'take' what portion is deemed yours, which comes down a calculated financial sum, but can't take the company, be cause it's partially owned by someone else, and they can't take the companies possessions.   It's a lot of T's to cross and I's to dot.  A lot of people don't want to bother with it.   That's why I'm homeless and how i plan to get out of it and never be in it again.
zts1tk,,j1gpwuy,This is easily one of the most painful things I've ever read here.   Child support should never make a person homeless. How does the court expect you to manage your parenting time? That's rhetorical, I know, they don't care and are happy to just take that away if you can't provide a home.
zts1tk,,j1gxs76,The situation in FL has been so bad that the state eventually officially recognized a new branch of law originally coined Father's Rights in FL, but once it branched out to other states became known as Non Custodial Parents Rights, to include women who pay child support or the children are in the other parents custody.  From i see in the news, it is slowly improving in FL. FL has the highest percentage of small businesses in America, mostly grossing way under what the average small business grosses annually. They also have the highest turn over rate of small businesses as some men find it easier to catch up on their child support by allowing the state to levy their businesses and business assets, etc.  Every man in FL is familiar w Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal. It describes how to use bankruptcy to your advantage.  Basically, as long as the company files bankruptcy, it's ok.
zts1tk,,j1ix666,Yup it‚Äôs happening to me
zts1tk,,j1gxseg,>make a family member a silent co-owner. The levy can then only ‚Äòtake‚Äô what portion is deemed yours  I believe child support and other garnishments can‚Äôt just dip into your business bank and assets. I would consult with an attorney or a tax expert before going to deep. Even a single member , it‚Äôs a separate entity with its own name, bank and tax number. Of course there are exceptions, but if it‚Äôs filed properly and business funds aren‚Äôt used for personal use they should not be able to legally levy or garnish an entirely separate entity‚Äôs bank account or assets.   An S corp is a pass through entity as well, taxes will pass through onto the shareholder(s). A C corp is not pass through and files separately.
zts1tk,,j1gy1up,I will have to check on the differences between the S and C Corps, but as far the , it's a seperate entity, but still owned by an individual. If it's partially owned by others, that will help prevent the seizure of it, but from the two levies I've been through, the state can seize all property to (at least partially) satisfy a debt.
zts1tk,,j1gyz2c,I understand. I have heard of people doing this before. I also have an  (but not for this reason), I‚Äôm not sure it can be seized but it‚Äôs always good to consult with a professional before following through. Both an  or an entity that elects S corp status should both protect you. I‚Äôd say, more than anything, make sure it‚Äôs set up right and kept separate. Some people mess up by having a business entity but borrowing funds for personal use or mixing funds up and it hurts them in the long run. Sometimes it can void liability protection. I hope this plan works out for you.
zts1tk,,j1h10ul,Actually, it was a the Dept of Revenue that told me how to set it up. Kinda. Basically, because an  taxes pass through to me, and I pay them on my Individual form, it's my asset, which can be seized. Whereas an S/C Corps taxes are seperate from mine, it's more difficult, not impossible,to seize that structure, but they're Liable... It's better to have an  owned by a Corp than the other way around for two reasons. The  provides the liability extension, and the taxes pass through to something other than you. I'll have to research again which Corp is best for this, but that's the gyst.  Also, my Corp will be designated as a Holdings Company. It makes the simplest legal sense for owning another company, and if i need to dissolve the , I'll always have the Corp to start up a new one. That's the No.1 greatest aspect of the Corp.
zts1tk,,j1kr6w8,That makes sense. I‚Äôm not sure if they actually see it as an asset legally if you‚Äôre conducting business separately. But I also understand better safe than sorry. I recently read that business accounts and business assets can be seized under the guise of civil forfeiture. Even if it‚Äôs unjust you‚Äôd still have a bunch of legal trouble, so I don‚Äôt blame you for preparing for it.
zts1tk,,j1kuuj3,Right, the goal is to seperate Myself from company taxes and liability as possible while still owning the parent company and not accepting a salary from it, in exchange for a company home and veg, etc., while earning a legal income from the opposite end to pay my responsibilities and bills.
zts1tk,,j1kza2f,You're right about the C Corp.   Which inspired an alternate plan.   An Owner/Shareholder of a C Corp is only taxed on Dividends received.  If you create 3 seperate (X, Y, and Z) Holdings which create one XYZ Holding, Inc, which creates a StandAlone (apt) Management, , which hires you as the On Site Property Manager, and pays you reduced salary+commission for providing you with an apt; you should be able to live there for free, and not pay taxes on the dividends, if the 3 C Corps you own do not receive dividends from XYZ Holding, Inc, and the legal rental cost is deducted from your salary.  Then, StandAlone Mgt, , could notify the state of my employment there, the state could garnish my income as the Manager for CS payments, my rent is already payed, I'm technically not receiving dividends from the companies i own, which are not receiving dividends, other than what is necessary by law, from the company they own. All business taxes and liability stop at the C Corp which owns the . Even if the IRS doesn't like that, I'm not receiving dividends from the Companies I own, and the fair market value of the property and associated taxes are already being paid via a reduced salary.  I could offer a commission package of $1k bonus for ea new resident, plus $100.00 of ea on time rental payment.  If the paid reduced salary plus deductions is $20k mo, and there's 8 units, that's still $2800mo in taxable income. Or, you could take 10% of ea on time rental payment, and with how rent is going these days, you might earn more via that, than any other way. And that brings up other tax issues I'm not versed on yet.  I think we figured this out.  Thanks for the feedback on this topic!
zts1tk,j1hjsfs,,I‚Äôm not homeless anymore, but was for a period of time in 2016/2017. I grew up in foster care and had abusive foster parents. I moved out at 17 with a boyfriend. When we broke up I was still in college without enough money to for my own housing and no family to help me out.
zts1tk,j1i96g6,,I was homeless for a short period of time in 2013. I sold a business that would provide me $4k a month (owner financed; from the buyer) so I could return to graduate school and become a single mom by choice at age 41. Gave birth to a special needs child. Economy crashed and new buyer defaulted on payments.  No one would watch my screaming infant so I had to stay home with him. House was underwater on mortgage. It was crazy and happened fast. I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly I lost everything. Filed for bankruptcy protection and lived out of my car, tent camped, spent nights at friends and family until I got into a $600 a month studio apt. Then bought a duplex out of foreclosure in a bad neighborhood and got on food stamps, etc. Slowly rebuilt. Humbling experience for sure!
zts1tk,j1ieqbg,,My income is 840 a month, and I'm not allowed to save more than $2,000.
zts1tk,j1g3umn,,My time being homeless was mainly  do to lack of money and just bad luck.
zts1tk,,j1ggg1q,Howd you get out of it?
zts1tk,,j1hd4v1,A friend got me a job. It didn‚Äôt pay very well,but it was enough  over time to get a place to rent. My friend let me sleep in his mother‚Äôs garden shed some. I slept in my car mostly. One week I slept in the woods when my car was broke down at a store. I had a tent with holes in it. I tried using black electric tape to patch it. When my car was broke down I saw a cousin and his friend. They looked at my car and couldn‚Äôt fix it but my cousins friend gave me $60. I was able to buy The part I needed with his money and the little bit I had. I remembered his name and I finally tracked him down last year. I mailed him a letter and I repaid the money plus some extra.
zts1tk,,j1imh4b,I don't feel like i have anyone in this area who could or would help me.
zts1tk,,j1jzuj4,Don‚Äôt  give up. You never know what can happen.
zts1tk,,j1k1v5f,I wish I could give up. I can't. Even when i scream at God that i don't want to do this anymore. Something inside me will never let me give up.
zts1tk,,j1k2dam,Are they any services in your state that could help you?
zts1tk,,j1k2q4s,There are. Not the greatest. AZ is a sink or swim state. I e reached out to the VA, and also to the services they referred me too. It's the holidays though. No one's working. I'm not sure if want to be around others right now anyways. I just want to sleep in a regular bed a few nights a week. Not worry about a cop tapping on my window.
zts1tk,,j1k5zru,I started a reddit called HomelessHomebound. I figure if all the homeless people who are tryna get into a home have a place where we can share, it'll help all of us. This reddit is good, but for some, it's hit an miss, especially with so many who choose to be homeless on this one telling everyone to just accept it and get over it.  I understand that i must accept my current situation, but i don't have to accept this an enduring situation.
zts1tk,,j1k7pig,Can you move to a state with better services or a city ?
zts1tk,,j1k9mw6,I have two storage lockers i need to empty before i do that. I also have a stepson who i made promises to, one of which was i would stay in this area until he turned 18 (hes 14), in case living with his dad doesn't work out. After that, i might move to an area an hr east of san diego. Or, if my ex can immigrate to western Canada, I'll move to Alaska, they pay residents 2k annually to live there yr round, and they have entire communities inside highrises connected by tunnels so you never have to go out in the winter.  And my business plans don't conflict w either plan. The alternate is move to Mexico, but i definitely need to be self supporting and financially secure to do that. That would include real estate investment and management.
zts1tk,j1fuumq,,Well, I only had a couple of homeless hours in the UK once, as I agreed to rent a small flat and, as I was rolling my bags to the place the owner was getting out and informed me he gave it to another. Good luck he said. I did end up finding a replacement in the next 6 hours, but it was some Polish woman's closet, I kid you not!  A few solar cycles later, I found myself in socially conscious north Europe, where during my hostel stay I met a local who gave me a good monthly price for his place, little did I know it was for his coke bill. Anyway, we lived happily ever after for a total of 2 weeks, but as I was completing my paperwork, applying for jobs and such, he calls me completely enraged and said "I told you not to register, you're fucking my life, you leave tomorrow". I had not idea my paperwork would trigger this abominable "registration" that all informal and illegal landlords are scared off. Before I even had the time to work on that, I got in a road accident, was hospitalised for a week, and upon exit... had no ability to work and nowhere to go.
zts1tk,j1g5pbn,,couldnt afford rent, didnt want to keep working my ass off in shitty jobs for little in return, and have trouble staying in one place for long anyway.

zts1tk,j1ivjb0,,Okay for me it went just like this. I had a job, I was let go, had a lead to another job and was told to wait. Waited and waited. Someone backed out on their word, I thought I could save money in the interim by sleeping in my car.Job never came through. Applied to other jobs..now here I am
zts1tk,j1k66pr,,My wife left me, and I lost the will to live. Without her, there is no beauty in the world. Food has no taste and music is just noise. My live truly has no meaning or purpose. I am broken beyond what words can describe.  The day she had the divorce papers served, I was working from home. It was a Friday. I finished up my call, closed my laptop, and never signed in again. My whole world collapsed.  I was an IT consultant. I made over $100k per year. I‚Äôm not bragging, I‚Äôm just giving the facts. I traveled Monday through Thursday to various parts of the US every week for work. And I gave it all up without a second thought.  I lived in my car for a while. Drove around the country. For some people, that would have been exciting, but for me, I was just driving. I hardly remember any of it. I was just driving each day, and sleeping in the trunk of my car each night, hoping for a miracle. But that miracle never came.  I lived in my car for awhile. Then, after a month of freezing my ass of in Minnesota, I stayed in hotel rooms for a couple of months (using the ‚Äúhotel points‚Äù that I had accumulated working as a traveling consultant). Eventually, I got an apartment and spent a year sleeping on a yoga mat and living life through my phone. And when my money began to run out, I became homeless.  I‚Äôm currently living in a small bivvy tent just outside Tulsa, Oklahoma. I have enough money to eat, but that won‚Äôt last forever.  I have nowhere to turn for help. My family is extremely toxic and devoid of love. My friends are either screwed up in their own ways, or they have this own lives. I‚Äôm sure I could go to them if I had a plan, but I don‚Äôt. I just want to do nothing, forever.  I am exhausted beyond words. I just lay in my tent all day. Sometimes I walk to the nearest convenience store to get some food. Sometimes I‚Äôm too exhausted to even look at my phone. I just want to sleep forever. I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore.  I‚Äôm a good person. I don‚Äôt do drugs or drink. I don‚Äôt even drink caffeine (because it triggers my anxiety). I don‚Äôt steal. I‚Äôm not violent. I try to be kind to everyone I meet, even when I‚Äôm hurting inside. I made mistakes in the past, but years of introspection have helped me to understand the root cause of those bad behaviors so that I never repeat them again. I just want to be loved. I just want to be with my wife again.  Before you judge me to harshly, please consider this: We all experience the emotion of love in different ways, and we all experience loss in different ways. Some people will be sad for just a day or two, some will be broken for a few months and then slowly recover, and some - like me - will be utterly and completely broken.

zts1tk,j1s4yaa,,I was in the hospital for a while due to an accident and no insurance money and lost everything.
zts1tk,j1gvaao,,It‚Äôs not really just one thing, it was a combination of things. Being born into a poor family didn‚Äôt help, dishonest landlords don‚Äôt help, housing otherwise being insane doesn‚Äôt help. There‚Äôs no limit to what a landlord can ask up front in my state so they usually double the security deposit (which they just keep anyways) and then change the price of monthly rent last minute by marking it way up. Literally just crossing prices off and re-writing higher prices on the lease right in front of me. I just got sick of dealing with it and gave up on even trying to find decent people to rent from. If I finally got in somewhere I‚Äôd live there for a year then have issues with the owner/management trying to get extra money out of me again. I‚Äôd rather just not deal with it. If I bother trying again it still happens to this day so I just tell them I don‚Äôt agree to their terms and stop talking to them.   Instead I got a traveling job that paid per diem. Instead of paying for a hotel I‚Äôd usually stay in a conversion van or at a campground if the weather is right. I just save and invest all of the travel pay or use it to tackle debt. I‚Äôm not homeless now but I still do this if I‚Äôm on a job far from home. Over the years I‚Äôve met people in my travels so I can usually stay with co-workers or people I used to work with if I end up back in the same areas. It‚Äôs an easy way to live cheap and invest a good portion of your check, since per diem roughly doubles the checks. I‚Äôm fortunate that it‚Äôs just circumstances that made me homeless and not disease or other health issues.

ztrhs4,j1ftdc7,,I assure you much worse has happened at shelters! And frankly, some of the worse emanates from guests not taking their meds, some don't take their diabetes meds because of childish tantrums, others legitimately "need" heavier stuff, meaning so they won't harm self or others, and don't take them precisely of the side effects which, let's face it, is always a personal thing, but how much can you trust self-reporting from people that need heavy stuff in the first place? As I wrote elsewhere, my own friend messed himself pretty bad taking vodka on top of his meds because he felt he need to treat his side effects.   Now, of course there can be rotten apples in the shelter, cruel staff I mean, and once in a while you get the whole place being an abomination in the eyes of the Lord LOL. If you suspect they've gone rogue and heartless, do everybody a favour and write a complaint somewhere, not on Reddit. But if you think it was simply a matter of degree, as in they should have left you off the hook once, well, do forgive them because the psychological dimension of their work is a pure impossibility. Each and every troubled guest may need a team of 10 to properly attend them, while the reality is the opposite, they might have a team of 10 for 1000 needy guests.
ztrhs4,j1hwj9c,,I mean, forgive me but, it sounds like rules were laid out and you didn‚Äôt follow them.   Is the issue at hand here how they handled letting you know they were aware that you didn‚Äôt attend the therapy appointment?
ztrhs4,j1eww1k,,What's the medication?  You can take it a few hours before appointments so they think you're compliant.  But otherwise there's no reason to take it if it isn't helping.

ztrhs4,,j1f0ky5,No, first I was on haldol. Then I switched to raylar, and then it was seroquel
ztrhs4,,j1f17nv,Okay, that makes sense.   It would be a massive red flag for them to start with Seroquel, as you usually have to try at least 2 other drugs first.   Having said that, if you don't feel better on the drugs they gave you then definitely don't ever go back to that doctor.   Unfortunately psychiatry is very underserved and there are as many bad psychiatrists as good ones.
ztrhs4,,j1f4ie2,Seroquel is a heavy ass med. Shit made my body forget how to swallow. Dr at the time denied this and said that only happens on another med. Now I'm on different ones, but I can't fathom taking that shit if I didn't have symptoms for the need of it, or if I didn't want to take medication, especially if the only reason it was wanted for me was because I was homeless. That was a shitty shelter, I'm sorry you went through that

ztrhs4,j1f8djf,,I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. Double standards. If any person who wasn‚Äôt experiencing homelessness cancelled an appointment, nobody would care. They feel like they can control you because they feel you need them and they have the upper hand. Unfortunately they don‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre an adult who can make decisions about your own mental health and your own life.
ztrhs4,j1ew686,,That was pretty rude and patronizing. I understand they want you to go to the appointmenty because they see to many people give up so easily. But it's alright to not go for one time when your are not feeling well and that should be your own decision.  By the way, how are you right now? Did things get better and did the therapy help in the end?
ztrhs4,,j1ey8wy,It was pretty bad. I left the shelter shortly after that though to live with a relative. Anything is better than that, I'm glad I'm not there anymore. Thank you for what you said
ztrhs4,,j1fs51u,Glad you were able to move on from that place‚Ä¶really unhelpful of them to have treated you that way.  No doubt, this still continues and even in different ways.   Thank you for sharing. Hopefully someone in a similar situation comes across your posting and realizes they aren‚Äôt alone in being treated unjustly.
ztrhs4,j1gwv58,,I'm sorry you got humiliated.  That's one of the worst emotions of all time.  But to be fair, you didn't totally uphold their policy. I get that it was not a nice experience, and it made you feel like shit on a ricecake,  but if going to appointments is one of the requirements for being there and you just "got tired of going" then it was perhaps to be expected? Every home, shelter, charity, hotel, army, rental unit,  job, box store, movie theatre, Reddit forum, loan program, tribe, astronaut camp, major league ball team, and even private household usually has some kind of rules or policies that must be followed, however intrusive or dumb. That's the price of admission. I'm not saying they're always nice rules, kind rules, or even common sense rules, but in this life, if you don't respect rules you usually get punished in some way...

See how I‚Äôm keeping it simple for you? üòÇ   Lastly, your last statement wasn‚Äôt long, it was shorter than this response so your inference that you were being more concise the first time is complete foolishness, as was the idea anything you sad in either statement qualifies as concise  Doesn‚Äôt matter how basic or advanced the term you‚Äôll find a way to use it incorrectly with blind confidence.

zt7gd4,j1cexr7,,Meat. Once you are out in the cold for a while, it stops being uncomfortable. Your body is used to being somewhere warm, so the car feels colder than it is. Inorder to stay warm once you are acclimated, you have to eat a lot, and it's hard to find enough protein in the winter. Hot meals are terribly underrated.
zt7gd4,j1cdird,,Not exactly what you are talking a about, but I've always found people very grateful for clean or new warm socks.  Foot hygiene is really tough. Socks end up being disposables a lot. Can also work as mittens in a pinch.  Used to get bulk packs and put 2 pair in a zip lock bag. People would turn down food, but always took socks.
zt7gd4,j1clnto,,I do outreach here, and I usually keep handwarmers, ponchos, and emergency blankets in stock. Occasionally I get random donations or do a big buy of other stuff like beanies and gloves, socks, compact rolls of toilet paper, I tend to keep hygiene supplies too.  As far as food goes, I tend to get stuff from the dollar tree, like small packs of jerky, slim Jim's, bottles of water, instant coffee, protein bars and granola

zt7gd4,j1dxwzu,,I live in Winnipeg so to me I‚Äôd be sleeping in shorts and a t shirt with a 5$ fleece blanket for 8-10/12 months a year if I was in Texas  We get to -20 for over a months worth of days every year. Last winter we had over half a month of days below -30   Wool Socks. Balaclava as it covers the one part exposed that usually isn‚Äôt: the face Thermal underwear  Mitts if things Gets below 0 to -5   Depending on weather and their situation  Emergency blanket, another blanket or even a sleeping bag. Any are good  I‚Äôm summer we have to deal with keeping Hydrated to stay safe   In the winter it‚Äôs the opposite You don‚Äôt want to be dehydrated but you don‚Äôt sweat much/anything out and the more water in your system the more energy your body will use to keep your pee warm, because water inside your body that isn‚Äôt heated would freeze people to death or give hypothermia pretty quickly in freezing temps. Inside or on the skin surface.   Again depending  On situation, a heated blanket or a heater and extension cord if they have shore power.    Hot meals like Soup or something warm especially when warm liquid really feels nice on the insides.
zt7gd4,j1f90uk,,My homeless friend had shoes taped together with duct tape last time I saw him, I took him and his gf to get new pairs and some warm socks. They say it‚Äôs what they go through the most with all the walking. They also said Sweaters, windbreaking jackets and other wearables that can be layered for Christmas would be nice. Things that are easy to carry and light, and that they can easily throw in their backpack or cart.
zt5lml,j1c3kck,,In the United States the resources available to homeless people vary a *lot* from state to state, even from county to county, or city to city. Some resources are provided by the government, sometimes resources are available through non profit organizations. The eligibility for different resources varies too; sometimes you need to be referred in order to access certain resources.   The only thing that seems mostly universal that is available to *most* people in *most* states is EBT or food stamps. The amount you can get and how long you can get them varies a lot though. The fact that there isn‚Äôt a simple, universal set of benefits that all homeless people can receive is one of the reasons it can be so hard trying to get help.   I have no idea how it compares to aid for immigrants, I‚Äôm not at all familiar with that.
zt5lml,,j1dq0qv,Thank you for the information
zt5lml,,j1jsanw,Texas here: unless you are working 20hrs/wk or can prove you have a disability, you only get 3mos of SNAP/foodstamps every THREE YEARS. Many homeless adults have psych or substance issues and they can't navigate the paperwork. To make it worse, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services is running MONTHS behind. Those who should qualify for emergency benefits (within 24hrs) are left in the cracks. There is weird legislation with the pandemic but many programs are AVAILABLE but not funded. So, I've seen a domestic violence shelter turning away families when they had space available. The Texas Attorney General messed up and put a garnishment on my disability benefits (not uncommon) for child support when my children have separate benefits through the federal government and it's been preventing me from qualifying for "public housing" because my monthly income is more than $0 but less than the SSI amount for indigent disabled. This is happening to veterans, too. Working means losing medical benefits (Medicaid pays my Medicare co-pays and deductible and premiums) and my 20% would have been more than I can feasibly earn.   My suicide attempt would have been ~$80K for my portion. I wanted to die but I'm too valuable as a conduit of federal dollars to for-profit healthcare. They went to extremes to bring me back to life, court order me to inpatient treatment and then release me to a homeless shelter. I wish I were kidding.
zt5lml,j1e0dti,,As someone that just started working in housing it is extremely confusing (for no good reason). I'll try to break this down without jargon: every region/city/state is responsible for setting up a non-profit that annually submits a single grant application on behalf of all homeless service providers in the area. This organization is also responsible for collecting data about individuals and families experiencing homelessness within their area, which is submitted with that application to justify the funding requests. There are a lot of ways this approach fails the same people it is supposed to serve:  - Most of the providers are non profits, not government agencies. This means that there's pretty low compliance with all parts of the process, from collecting accurate data - through to actually delivering the services promised. And no one to really hold them accountable because...  - The lead agency is also a non profit, not a government agency. Most are chronically ill equipped to enforce the stipulations of the grant funding.  - There's no formal way to create more providers in an area if they are deemed necessary. This means lots of places have patchy services, often run by religious groups that use discriminatory practices.  To me (who's only been working for a lead agency for about 4 months) this feels super hands-off and ineffective for such a serious problem. On that note, the federal government does provide a LOT of funding opportunities if the lead agency can get their shit together and keep providers in compliance. Most don't discriminate between citizens, refugees, or immigrants (legal or otherwise) when they offer services... but there are some specialized providers, especially if there is a high need in the area.   Most places will have...  - domestic violence shelters for women and children (hopefully men too but it's less common) - veterans services (us armed forces only) - overnight emergency shelters for various populations - permanent supportive housing projects for individuals with disabilities - rapid rehousing projects to help place recently evicted folks into empty housing units - temporary housing projects with various types of social services built into the program to help folks achieve stability - outreach programs that run various kinds of drop in centers or travel around to do street outreach. - some places also have refugee resettlement agencies (mine has these, including agencies that help folks who've been trafficked.)  If you want to learn more about these, check out the HUD Exhange: https://www.hudexchange.info/. You're free to DM me too if you have more questions, and I'll do my best to answer them.
zt5lml,,j1e957e,If you can find a single domestic abuse shelter for men I'd love to see it üòî
zt5lml,,j1e16hz,Thank you, I will reread this.  I have been reading about so many homeless that have died over the past year, (I think it‚Äôs an annual memorial-on the first day of winter) and it seems that there is not enough government funding for housing.  It‚Äôs kinda sad.
zt5lml,j1e3804,,In what country? Crossing what border? Here in Sweden you have to be drug free to get any help more or less, but once you are you can get both shelter and apply for your own apartment eventually
zt5lml,,j1e9unt,I'm assuming the USA
zt5lml,j1etemq,,I've been thinking of a homeless app on and off for years now. I may combine it with a fun charitable app I had in mind, but will need more resources
zt5lml,j1g5uk3,,There‚Äôs also a huge gap between what is or might be available and what folks are actually able to access. I consider myself a lot more aware than many of what resources exist (I‚Äôve been disabled and impoverished for many years, homeless the last 7 months.) and I‚Äôve repeatedly been in situations where the social worker or case manager whose job it is to help me isn‚Äôt even aware of the programs I‚Äôm informing them exist.   It‚Äôs actually accessing those resources that‚Äôs the problem. I‚Äôve had so dang many issues with all manner of problems and incompetence with the Department of Human Services. Like mistakes made on their end. At least with DHS you eventually get some level of response. I‚Äôve found many places that offer aid don‚Äôt even return calls or do the things they say they will.   I‚Äôm well aware of things that exist that could help me tremendously. I just can never seem to actually access them. And just about any time I‚Äôve ever managed to access any benefit- even including my social security disability- I figured it out entirely on my own and did it with no help. It‚Äôs wild how many times people whose job it is to help don‚Äôt manage to get me anywhere at all. And often, good luck even accessing the case manager or benefits coordinator or whatever in the first place.   That‚Äôs what I see as the biggest problem of all. I can‚Äôt know for sure what it‚Äôs like for immigrants or refugees and such but it seems like there‚Äôs always so many people willing to help those folks navigate their options. I‚Äôve seen a lot of local community and religious based organizations be allowed focused on immigrants while having no resources to help their own community members access similar services and help.
zt5lml,j1e0zi0,,People get better care from illegally crossing the border than vets and US citizens üôÑ
zt5lml,,j1e1xya,I agree, we need to take care of our homeless population. There‚Äôs so many homeless that die every year for lack of housing and food. There are thousands crossing the border every day, and they are taken care of. What is wrong with our society?
zt5lml,,j1fpi1l,Are they? Many go to family. We don't put them all up in their own apartments. Not to mention the vast majority start jobs asap.
zt5lml,,j1e398b,Law makers and people in power want to secure their votes if that passes
zt5lml,,j1hf7p8,You talk as if the people crossing the border aren't homeless, too.  And they are not 'taken care of', many migrants end up on the streets without support. They die just as well, right next to people who are homeless with a passport. The cold doesn't give a fuck. Give up your citizenship and see how easy it is to get help.
zt5lml,,j1he4pz,In what world? [Over here in the EU](https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/europes-black-sites/), there are torture chambers for migrants along the border. They will set your clothes on fire and push you back. Violently herd groups of people into shipping containers and let them bake in the sun. They'll break bones, and sometimes, will shoot migrants on sight. Even if you manage to get into Europe, if you're homeless and undocumented you get nothing. I somehow doubt the US is much better.  People are really deluded about what migration looks like.
zt5lml,,j1hp5jx,I live in the US and it's very real here
zt5lml,,j1hv315,Give up your citizenship, then.  Become a migrant, get better care. Easy peasy!  Just try to avoid the:  >child sexual assault, enforced hunger, threats of rape, and brutal detention conditions  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/21/us-border-agents-shocking-abuses-asylum-seekers
zt5lml,,j1hx0qo,Aye that's pretty bad, but that's dooming the entire apple tree for a few bad apples
zt5lml,,j1ia3lb,Yes, that's the thing, it's the whole system:  >A Honduran asylum seeker reported conditions in the McAllen facility in 2019: ‚ÄúI was there for 10 days sitting, I couldn‚Äôt move because it was 67 of us in that cell. We said we needed toilet paper and water and ‚Ä¶  we reported the animals, the scorpions in there. There were scorpions, ants, ticks, fleas and they would tell us that it was fine, it was because of our own stink of being there 45 days.‚Äù  At least in most homeless shelters in the US, you are not shoved in a cramped cell and forced to wallow in a layer of shit and insects.
zt5lml,,j1iif9y,You must not have been in any shelters , but! I digress it is a horrible situation no one on earth should have to endure.

zt5lml,,j1e9oaj,No, a lot get shelter, food, medical care, child care, dental and eye screenings.. more than I ever got
zt5lml,j1hcxu4,,Over here, it's much worse for homeless migrants. You can't get into shelters when undocumented (which just means 'no passport for the country you're in'). Also there are illegal torture chambers along the border.

zt2qhf,,j1be3r3,No problem! I'll copypasta this over there right now.
zt2qhf,,j1bev05, Thank you so much!   I'm currently homeless and tryna keep myself together. I have so many bills and so much debt and no savings, so one little mishap could send me down further, but I'm here tryna help others, because there's really no one to help us in our situations.   I can't just leave everything behind like some of the places around here expect of me! My ex took our kids back home and I'm tryna send all their things to them.   Anyway, I really appreciate it, and I'm sure it will make a huge impact on many other people!     Thank you!
zt2qhf,j1bxior,,Good life experience
zt2qhf,j1c62rm,,You have a way with words. You had me mesmerized. Have you written any books? Maybe you could write a book about your life and I know it would be a bestseller. My dad used to also have mania I think he was bi polar and my mom had depression. In his manic times he wanted to run for president. He always was changing his jobs once he left the police department. Have you gotten into housing yet? I hope so though I bet you met loads of amazing people. I would love to hear more from you some time. I hope you have a great night. üíú
zt2qhf,,j1c78o0,Thank you, I appreciate you taking the time to write something so kind. I'm actually waiting to pick up my book and work on the third draft so that I can see it with fresh eyes. I do have [a collection of my best writing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18J7ZBzKZBXviPmrshjwt-bUGQGBWcl65h8WfPMzDTNk/edit?usp=drivesdk)  that I want to turn into another book, but as it's mostly educational and inspirational (and funny, too), I'm currently using it as a tool to help people the most I can. That said, I am housed; have been for almost two years thanks to the bestest friend I could ask for. Thanks again for sharing, and I wish you the best! Much love!
zt2qhf,,j1d0c85,I will definitely take a look at your collection I bet is as amazing as how you write here. Maybe you should have been a teacher but even in your day to day life you can teach the people who want to helped and those who just want to learn from you. I am so happy you are finally housed and thank your friend who helped you. I hope you both have the happiest and merriest of holidays! Sending much love your way. üíúüíú
zt2qhf,,j1d12mp,Some of the stuff in there is different than this; basically I role play a crazy character to create absurdist humor in my educational material. Makes it more digestible to certain demographics, but it's not everyone's cup of tea. I'd like to create an educational nonprofit, and I'm taking steps to make that a reality. It's fun and rewarding. My life is really coming together, even if it's bumpy at times. Comments like your kind words help remind me that I'm accomplishing my dreams slowly but surely. So, I thank you for sending your wonderful vibes my way, and I send you much love and light as well, friend. üíöüôåüíö
zt2qhf,,j1d2cyw,Well I guess we need a good sense of humor to read it then. My dad wrote a lot and some of his writing is as a character with his memories but the voice of this guy named Tony. He grew up poor in a family of 11 including his parents and joined the police department when he met my moms family who were all police. He did it for 20 years then went out on a mental disability. He started his own chimney sweeping business where he mostly did restaurants and some houses. He would wear a big black top hat like they did in the 1800-1900's. Sometimes would make me embarrassed. I would give anything now to see that ridiculous hat. There were so many people at his funeral and wake showed me how much of an impact he had. I am so happy your dream is coming true and I wish you all the good luck with it. If you write a book be sure to let me know. Sending all my love and good wishes your way. üíúüíú
zt2qhf,,j1fx1wc,I just wanted to let you know that is a good story about your father. He sounds like he was a good man. You're lucky for having known him as you did.

zt2qhf,,j1c8paf,Glad I could help. I wish you the best; may your journey not have too many bumps, but rather just enough that you can handle the path and come out the other side as the best version of yourself that is possible.
zt2qhf,j1do0pq,,This is amazing. You are a good writer, so please consider that as a form of expression.
zt2qhf,,j1dodv0,Thank you, you're very kind. Writing, juggling, and performance arts are all my forms of expression.
zt2qhf,,j1dosff,I‚Äôm a writer too, and I think that could be a way for me to make sense of this bizarre situation.
zt2qhf,,j1dpxiw,It did for me. I made it my mission to help people with my art, whether by teaching, inspiring, or entertaining them. Did wonders for me. I highly recommend getting in the groove of writing daily. Try this; if possible, as soon as you wake up, start writing a 1-2k word stream of consciousness. Don't try to make it anything fancy; whatever comes to mind, put down on paper. This not only will act as a form of reflective therapy for what's going on in your unconscious mind, but it will also help you develop your voice as a writer. It is a practice that promotes neurogenesis, as it forces your brain to form new connections as you connect different ideas in novel ways. I've been doing this for seven years. I owe my success as a writer to this practice. May it serve you now.
zt2qhf,j1cbc7n,,This is in a class all it's own. 11 points! Reading your post history now and loving it. xD
zt2qhf,,j1cbq5g,Thank you. I'm glad you like my wordsmithing; I've worked hard to reach this point where I have such an effect on people. I'll keep making my educational and inspirational content for you all! Teaching is my passion.
zszib3,j1bbfrv,,Lmao I know what happened. How did it end up happening when all the tents were inspected right before and then the lady fell 6 feet, turned around said she didn't need any help and walked away...because she was STEALING lmao
zszib3,,j1byzvn,But why bulldoze/loader peoples only place to live, right before a SERIOUS cold snap? Seem a tad inhumane no? Thats the real story here. But you also believe someone heartless enough to do this is also diligent at performing safety checks?

zsls8a,j1bbla2,,Santa Rosa?
zsls8a,,j1bbmz3,Yeah
zsahcx,j17fejc,,from what I understand reading posts here & elsewhere, the largest hurdle to overcome is other homeless people & their antisocial behavior (greed, thieves, intentional maliciousness, rampant drug abuse, mental illness, etc).   you'd have to police your own community to weed out the bad actors, and then find some way to keep them out/away.  seems unrealistic
zsahcx,,j17oimq,Agree.  Things would quickly get out of hand, if not a strong group of leaders and those willing and fit (not necessarily physically, but like those that actually are a good fit for the community) enough-all would need to believe in common core values and goals.   I absolutely love the idea of a community, but the execution of it would be tricky.  Example: I really love my dog, but someone else may have a fear of dogs. How do we mediate the issue?  Example 2: I am vehemently opposed to cigarette smoke anywhere within say 200ish feet of me. (Using my neighbors as a guide)  I‚Äôll be outside working and as soon as I smell it will snarl‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a knee jerk reaction an innate response. So for me, depending on how much I had to deal with just cigarrett smoke‚Ä¶as snobby as it may sound, that alone is a big enough deal for me to leave and move on elsewhere.   Other than that, it seems communities would require a strong network and communication, organization like you wouldn‚Äôt believe and a constant state of flux to adapt and achieve goals, as well as, have any kind of longevity.
zsahcx,,j1ak6ya,[deleted]
zsahcx,,j1auwj8,Admittedly, this was a bit crushing to read‚Ä¶because it‚Äôs certainly something I‚Äôm missing in daily life‚Ä¶a sense of community.   Sadly, just given what little experience I have helping family and friends‚Ä¶The act of reciprocity since I‚Äôve been down has been minimized to texting suggestions, which is at least somewhat helpful‚Ä¶but also not much by comparison.  I guess I mean to say, I see your points.  I know my experience is far from starting a community, but yeah, seems on par for people to ultimately be stubborn and selfish.  Still pretty badass that you started a community though!
zsahcx,j1bba2q,, Ive read all the comments this far, and the main point I see is that you can't start a community without people who want to be in a community helping each other, and sadly, it's seems, most are just 'fair weather friends' or perhaps, their situation is just as bad.     My vision is to have a property offset from a major town/city where people who want to get out of being homeless and want to get out of poverty can cime together to help each other do so.     My vision isn't for everyone who's homeless. Just those who want out of it. Those who like it either hide in the wilderness most of the time, or panhandle.    I hate my situation, and I'd jump at the opportunity for help if it didnt jeopardize my storage unit (which I'm trying to send to Mexico).   If i could right now help out someone like me, i would. I'd make space in my garage, if i had one, and help them clear that mess out of their life, and also help them learn a skill they can do from anywhere and earn a living wage.
zsahcx,,j1c6qk2,That‚Äôd be more of what I‚Äôd look for in a community location wise to start‚Ä¶away from a city. I‚Äôm stuck where I‚Äôm at and it‚Äôs not terribly large, over 200k, but big enough where there‚Äôs plenty of problems and no one cares.  I‚Äôve been helping someone for years, hoping that with each year that passed they‚Äôd be closer to getting a place to call their own, but it didn‚Äôt play out that way.  Housing costs kept going up and never stopped.  At least though, it was nice to know that my dogs had someone to feed them dinner when I could not.  So there were some positives.  For now, it seems I‚Äôve gone as far as I‚Äôm going to go unless I get something worked out.
zsahcx,,j1d4uum, The only way for many of us to overcome rising housing costs is to become small business owners. I have a sound idea on how to do that, given that the introduction is not a long term choice for most, but is a good 'foot in the door' and includes learning tax prep. Once a person has established a reliable source of income on their own terms, in a structure where they can transfer ownership of possessions/assets to their company to protect themselves from losing those in any sort of levy/law suit, THEN they can pursue those hobbies/interests they'd prefer as a future means of income, until those means replace the 'FitD' means.   It requires trust on both parts. It requires patience. It requires those providing help to others to establish their organization as a business which runs an At Profit side and a Non Profit side.   It requires a lot of work. And hopefully, those we help will turn around and help others in similar ways.    What has happened to our sense of community?
zs9gn7,j16xrd5,,Would this be a for-profit or non-profit? Two really big differences. Each one has complications and a complex structure and making it actually happen. Do a lot of research on what kind of permits you would need as a for-profit and a non-profit. Look at other organizations that does something similar, even if it's a non-profit. As a non-profit, you would be required to have a board of directors that is one of the requirements for an official non-profit organization. For a non-profit it would open you up to grants and sponsorships. But the same can be true for for profit. But a for profit business organization cannot apply to a non-profit grant. And vice versa for the non-profit. I like the concept but make sure to do your research.
zs9gn7,,j18x1sq,I'm researching now the best formation status. I'm ten years in the non profit sector and have done everything from street outreach and case management to grant writing and organizational development. I believe as a non profit I have enough pull to get major donations from the local hospital system and buy in from our homeless friendly,  servant leader mayor to start. I'm known for my strategies and ideas and make consultancy dollars reviewing programs/grant applications and creating partnerships (including for the above mentioned key players). Noone would be surprised to have me approach with a new model, at least a few might contribute just to see how far it could go.   I believe that lobbying would be an essential part of activities once membership is established, so traditional 501c3 wouldn't be a great fit. I'm less familiar with other 501 formats, but a fraternal organization may fit the bill. This also allows for member autonomy but would limit grant access and require members to do their own fundraising at times. Members wouldn't have to utilize services and could pay what they can,  so the Mayor for example could contribute $500 per month and never use the shower or kitchen, while Joe Schmoe could pay $1 per month and come three times a week.   I'm inspired in part by the work of Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin. They produced the Catholic Worker newspaper which helped to support activities in Houses of Hospitality, share needs,  and promote intellectual discussion on poverty in general.  I've got strong writing skills and friends of the same, including a friend who would benefit greatly from a place such as this.
zs9gn7,j17ghl2,,the overhead cost on something like that would be huge.  like, rehab clinic level expensive.  sounds kind of like a retirement community almost.  who funds that?  don't say the taxpayers, that'd be political suicide for anyone who suggested it.    so who funds it?
zs9gn7,,j18yho9,Rehabs also provide medical and mental health services. This would simply be a place of being, with no overnight accommodations to start (my state has a hospitality room loop hole in their emergency shelter laws but it seems like it is rarely utilized).  For clothing,  I have existing relationships with churches and thrift stores who would donate.    For food, I have connections with two food banks that don't require end user data and two groups that recieve overstock food and goods at no cost from major retailers.   The cost of membership would need to cover the utilities, two staff persons at 12 hours per day and janitorial services.    The building I have in mind has two rental units on the second floor which are both currently rented below market value and that would almost entirely cover the mortgage and taxes for the facility.    Ultimately,  I'd like to see those made available for short term leasing, but I'm not interested in evicting the current tenants or upping the rent.

You can also get stuff from goodwill, just don't buy clothes from there and if you do keep them in a plastic bag and wash them before using.  If you live in a city with a Target their flatware sets and plates etc are decently cheap and hold up extremely well.  Others have mentioned facebook etc. If you get a bed make sure it has feet and place traps under the feet and get mattress and box spring covers too. Do NOT trust building management about anything bedbug wise, especially in the USA. also do not buy or trust anything off of Craigslist, facebook or any of the other sites without inspecting it completely for signs of infestation.

zs6ld1,,j1bcc6f,I'll have to get that checked next weekend. My plans to buy a new battery got sidetracked.
zs6ld1,,j1g8682,I ended up having to replace both once upon a time.  That‚Äôs when I learned that a bad battery can bring down an alternator and also that testers which part stores may have are not all equal.  The DC output on the old alternator was not quite high enough, but if the battery was fully charged‚Ä¶could easily go a few days.  Anyhow, thankfully that particular alternator job was cake‚Ä¶unlike an ‚Äò88 accord I once had.

It's so disconcerting and depressing to see how many people can't get into the main shelter and wind up at the WS.

I slept in my coat for the week. The heater I have didn't work all that well. It felt more like a hearing blanket heater.  Air was pouring down from out of the faulty windows. I said to myself having the flue and the shivers, God will see me through this. One day their will be an end to this misery. I still pray every day to get housing. It seems like a dream almost and something out of reach. Obviously after an accumulated 40 years of homelessness, I just said pray. Just put news paper over the drafty windows, and keep on praying. This is all one can basically do when stranded.

Plus probably keeping propane and a buddy heater in your tent at all times in case it got bad, and you could get trapped there in a storm. It's minus 33 real feel where I'm at rn and I'll be shocked if nobody freezes through this storm, I doubt I could make it a mile on foot in this with my reasonably prepared boots and coat and balaclava without frostbite lol, even fully geared snowboarders ain't going out today. I bet you'd need 1-2k worth of clothes alone to make it though the day outside. I don't like camping under 40 degrees Fahrenheit, I mean do you guy but if it was me, and I am not a fan of shelters either, I would travel somewhere warm where I can camp for winter.
zrz1n5,j16dd21,,Go to aa meetings like a noon meeting daily, but don‚Äôt go to a camp. Drugs will be everywhere honestly and the weather is a death sentence. Maybe see if you can get on disability there? Sign up for it at least. See if they can fast track you into housing? This week stay in at least it‚Äôs gonna be bad.
zrz1n5,,j1g9ehl,I have no plans to stop drinking. The drugs I would like to stop tho. No, not a homeless camp. I would be off by myself, away from everyone. Got a nice little wooded area picked out, where nobody else it.  Yep, working on my disability application. I was told it's about a 6 month wait for housing, so not long.
zrz1n5,j16x5wy,,Super tough situation you're in. I can definitely relate to the shelter situation. I can definitely tell you that it's no different in metropolitan cities. That's definitely something that you're just going to have to decide on your own. Completely understand your reasons. But it is freaking cold out there. Do you have a counselor or a support group that you can go to everyday or at least a couple times a week?
zrz1n5,,j1g84xm,Yeah, I have tons of support for addictions and mental health. Got an advocate for housing too. Apparently the wait for housing is really short here because of the turnover. If what they said is true, I'll be housed in about 6 months.
zrz1n5,j17zt7r,,Think you know you. Like everything got to weigh out the pros and cons. Forty below is friggin scary. Made it through 1 bad winter(in midwest ) but was in an abandoned commercial building and lucky to be in a town that would pile you up w blankets free, no questions asked.  Have a backup plan though. Good luck and wishes to you.
zrz1n5,,j1g8ync,I can always return to the shelter I suppose. My biggest fear is that someone will steal my gear. If I return, I won't have any space in my locker for my tent, stove and sleeping bags. So I'd have to give them up... I have a bit of attachment to my sleeping bag system.
zrz1n5,j19ke6h,,The issues you‚Äôre dealing with are exactly why a lot of us steer clear of shelters. Winter camping is certainly do-able as long as you have decent gear. One of the most important things that is often overlooked is to put some insulation or padding underneath you. The ground is the biggest thief of warmth. I always scrounged pieces of carpet from the dumpster of a flooring store and placed it under my tent as well as on the floor of the tent. On top of that put a mattress or sleeping pad. I always got nice mattresses from the curb in nice areas, they‚Äôre a pain to haul but you only have to do it once.
zrz1n5,,j1g8ind,My sleeping bag system was rated for -40'C when new. It's probably down to -30'C now. Was planning on buying a cheap cot to sleep on so I'm off the ground.   I haven't made a decision yet.

zrx2gu,j153qo4,,I know your local shelter will have information on fostering while you stay at a shelter (I haven't been to many that allow animals). Fostering is just a temporary measure, someone looks after your pets until you are able to secure housing. As for that, look into your local resources through findhelp.org and calling 211. Not going to lie, san Diego,  much like most of CA,  is running low on resources so be sure to call up your local churches as well.  Good luck!
zrx2gu,j1ebprb,,There are many SRO‚Äôs that you could afford as well as Independent Living Facilities. Contact PATH People Assisting The Homeless and get a caseworker. The number is online. There is a shelter downtown run by Alpha Project. It‚Äôs called a bridge shelter. Call them and see if they have beds. San Diego is also opening a hotel downtown and turning the rooms into a shelter for seniors. I believe it‚Äôs opening right after the new year. There is also a shelter on the grounds of the County Psychiatric Facility in the Midway District. There is a shelter in East County called East County Transitional Living. All of these accept pets. But you have to register your dog as an emotional support animal. If you call the shelter they will tell you what websites you can use. You are basically buying a fake certification but I think it‚Äôs for the shelters liability. Good luck. You can message me if you have any questions. Oh and of course apply for Cal Fresh and Medi Care by calling 211. They can get you approved on the spot.

zrx2gu,j16suts,,My friends good friend house went on fire. The Red Cross was supposed to help her with her Cat that she raised as a kitten and was rescued. They hadn't helped her or her tenant.  I went to the blessing of the animals in 2017 around the same time this happened. I meet a, woman in a Shelter with two dogs. She said they live there with her in the Shelter. I looked for resources for shelters prior to meeting this woman. I could not find any shelter that allowed animals except Domestic Violence Victims.  If you get Service Animal Certified for your Dog, and Emotional Support Animal for Your Cat, by Law the Shelter cannot discrimate.. However in California, I am told that there is a waiting list to get into a Shelter. Your best bet is to take out a, loan and buy a easy towable tiny house. They are as low as $35,000 for an off grid and fully equipped with water caught system. They can be towed with most any car. Very low weight bearing. You can then buy a job. They have places that will take the first weeks pay as satisfaction for finding you a job. You can also do canning. Collecting cans and bottles and cashing them in. Set up you stand to sell interesting items you find, of course after cleaning them up.  Remember without housing you really can't be effective. You can't work contribute to society, or even help yourself. Incredible Tiny Homes have a product called an In-Cred-I Box. For sixteen feet, you get a complete home. They even have financial information to help you buy the house.  Being homeless and a senor citizen is a bitter life. It means a very shorten life span. Aggravation, and humiliation. Getting out of that situation means getting up and going ready for action before it is too late.

I would work the most hours eligible while still managing school. It'll probably be exhausting, from someone who was working 70+ hours a week and juggling school, but if you can get through it you'll be in a better position.   Everything sounds very bleak right now, and it definitely is, but this isn't the end of the line. Try to keep your head up and remember you're working towards something better. ‚úå‚òÆ

zru3ur,,j16p4y5,I'm sorry, I didn't see anything indicating that in the orginal post!! In that case I'd reccomend going around to different community resources and seeing what you can get from each of them. There are normally a LOT of things you can get for free or greatly reduced, but its hard to sniff out where you have to go to get them. A local shelter or community outreach center probably has a great masterlist of resources in your area :)  There's no shame in explaining your situation or using community resources, they're literally there for YOU :)

This will help a lot with saving money that could go towards finding a place/bills.   - Search up Restaurants, maybe you could find a job being a dishwasher. They are always looking from what my friends say.   - Try to see if you can apply to Uber or Door-Dash on a bicycle if you can.   - Try maybe a Skateshop maybe someone wil take you in.   - I don‚Äôt know how recycling cans works in your country but you could recycle cans from hotspots around town or city with a full covered mask on to cover your identity.

Also stop acting out. Don't make a bad situation worse. I was homeless as a child. I told my friends. They couldn't help me. When you are young there is hope However, when you get in your middle years, and older and become homeless it is a disaster. You can't recoup as well. Youth is on your side and hope. Older folks don't have that much hope after being homeless for decades. Getting housed is left to some, who will work day in and out, even a few hours a day to find resources. Go Fund Me is the last resort when all else fails.

It was supposed to come to fruition in march so I was just going to hang around until then or the couple months after when I could get the procedure done and end this already. But canadas priced their own citizens out of being able to pay bills/any chance at quality of life or in many cases like Toronto. People who make up the working class of Toronto can‚Äôt afford to live in Toronto‚Ä¶  They fucked us so bad that non suicidal people all flocked to it going ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôd like to do‚Äù One story went viral of a 60 year old guy who got failed by the system and then got approved for maid because he was going to be homeless and quickly said ‚Äúwell being dead is better then being homeless, especially here(Canada)‚Äù and it went viral and people raised over 60 thousand dollars for him so he up akd Changed his mind: that and a doctor or two were suggesting it to old people instead of offering fixes and reliefs to their ailments. That all caused large large issues because they realized they have made life So unliveable people were just signing up to die due to poverty. So now those of us hoping to get booked for an appointment in march for the coming months are stuck well they delayed the date and released no info about when the new date is. Just that ‚Äúwe‚Äôll talk about it in the new year‚Äù   Feels Like last winter when they had just strung us along ‚Äú2 more weeks‚Äù for about 45-60 weeks well They continued to take our rights. Hell they froze peoples bank accounts for supporting the trucker convoy(most famously the federal government literally froze a single mothers bank accounts and assets because she donated money so the trucker protestors could get gas and heat themselves since she supported what they were fighting for). So yeah be careful what you wish for, Canada is a socialist authoritarian hellhole that actually deals with tough weather unlike The states so the lack of freedom means a fuck ton of misery and potentially your life. A homeless lady 5 minute walk from me froze to death just 10 days ago before winter even started.   Last winter they blocked people for months and unvaxxed for over a year, from going To restaurants, arenas, post secondary schools literally everywhere except the grocery store and libraries I believe were also open:   The only places we were allowed was to buy food at grocery stores, they even blocked off the rest of Walmart aisles as if keeping everyone on the same path over and over was a solution üòÇ  They even tried to ban unvaxxed people from getting food and warned of legal troubles if you bought food for someone unvaxxed but the few provinces that tried that instantly had people strike   So again be careful what you wish for. This is a country that will make an example of you and Lead you to your own death if you don‚Äôt follow their rules. Even if the rules they enforced or called for were later berated and heavily criticized by countless other leaders mostly from Europe.    Also on top of all that, the odds they will Even let us die is slim to none especially with this backlash. Odds are since it‚Äôs their societal failure and our mental ‚Äúillness‚Äù for seeing things for what they actually are they will give us the ‚Äúwell things could get better so your stuck here‚Äù based of the latest reading I‚Äôve done.  If you are perpetually in pain physically that‚Äôs cool you can die  If you are perpetually in pain mentally you can deal with your issues in case they get better one day  Is the takeaway we are getting from it. Sounds like very few people with mental issues are going to qualify but my story is fucked and makes everyone cry   And/ or impressed that I‚Äôm still around when I actually sit down and tell it so I‚Äôm still going To try and die
zre6eb,,j153an7,I relate, whenever I tell people my life story they seem to react like it's the worst thing that's ever hapoen3d and then they get pissed off that I'm homeless and not functional lol. I'm so sick of America rimanticizing every other country because it's supposedly better. When it's not
zre6eb,,j1582x0,I‚Äôm functional but also homeless. The periods where I do nothing between work are much easier and remove most of the toughest moments of being homeless in a frozen tundra   It‚Äôs crazy though because from a non us citizen we just hear Americans brag about how great it is and they will never call anyone better or like there‚Äôs a better option. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm aware some Americans are as educated as anyone. We just don‚Äôt deal with many of those types because we aren‚Äôt American ourselves and Americans tend to be aggressively patriotic and nationalist. Part of that is surely that a lot of the Americans I deal with im dealing with in sports discussions.
zre6eb,,j15dit4,Most of the people out here who are hardcor into sports are arrogant, anyone with money is arrogant, anyone who has any sort of privilege that's seen as normal is arrogant, it's full of nothing but idiotic ignorant fuck heads who all shit on eachother because every single one of us with steady income, home, love, anything are only holding on by a fucking thread because no one out here is actually happy, they all try to deny the fact that they are always on the bridge of poverty so they shit on those of us that are in it out of fear. It's all about money, we are dying or being permanently damaged because of money
zre6eb,,j15mdph,Unfortunately I think you are right but it‚Äôs not limited to sports it‚Äôs a nationwide issue that effects many interests and demographics. But yeah we are neighbours and some of that sounds similar to Canada. You avoid some of that right wing ignorant BS and it‚Äôs replaced with some non sensical Socialist views from a government who wants it run entirely through them to the point they gatekeeper peoples ideas so that it can‚Äôt pass and then they just do it themselves. Bureaucracy at its finest lol. It‚Äôs socialist but wants everything run through the government so it‚Äôs authoritarian.  That‚Äôs why so many Americans seem to like PP(Pierre polievre) the Conservative party leader  He‚Äôs not so ignorant right for the most part, but condemns a lot of the left wing actions like the ‚Äúwoke movement‚Äù the mismanaging of funds and overpayments to liberal tied organizations and friends   He‚Äôs still got a few real ignorant way right views but to compare to the ignorant right views in the states he‚Äôs not far right at all. I‚Äôm voting Con this time around because I hate Trudeau and he‚Äôs done a poor job and Pierre is left enough for a right winger that I agree with a lot of his views being that I‚Äôm fairly central on the spectrum.   But yes greed is the main issue people in our spot face right now. There‚Äôs enough for everyone but not when less than 10% own 90% of the wealth(please correct these to the exact numbers, I just picked numbers I knew were safe/correct
zre6eb,j13os79,,You look familiar
zre6eb,j14xmdj,,Check into a behavioral health hospital for the depression. There is a bed, hot water, food, snacks, a social worker to talk about a place to go after,,,,they place people in shelters. Or group homes when appropriate. They try not to discharge people to the street.
zre6eb,,j14yv7h,Yeah, none of those things help lol. They shove you full of meds and expect you to become better instantly
zre6eb,,j14zbho,They don't force the meds. The op maybe could benifit from some of she could say, if this is the case, that she'd rather not. Would prefer to be helped via therapy. The group therapy isn't the greatest but it's not nothing. I'd beat down the door to get in compared to freezing.
zre6eb,,j14zqyc,They do force meds unfortunately
zre6eb,,j1508we,They cannot unless a person is taken to court for a med order. If they decide to keep someone against their will they have to go to court for that and a med order is harder to get and requires proof that a person is dangerous
zre6eb,,j151uwi,You must be outside of USA, that's not how any of that worms. I'm glad that you are privileged enough to actually receive decent healthcare
zre6eb,,j151ykg,I am in tx, usa
zre6eb,,j152aa7,You have obviously never been I'm crisis and had to get treatment, and if you were than you got lucky
zre6eb,,j1504wg,this is a good idea. i hope you're feeling better op.
zre6eb,j147cf8,,I just want to send you love. I understand pain, being alone, and even rejection. I just want to say you are loved and human. Your not alone. This is the worst time of the year for depression. It gets better when the weather is better. Im sorry again. You are valued as a human here.
zre6eb,j13mg25,,Don't be afraid to hold your hand out, I figured that out after my mom died and it was really uplifting when someone responded.  A majority of people in society seem to think its honorable to ask if you are in need.
zre6eb,,j13o0ir,I don‚Äôt really have anyone to ask for anything. Im all alone out here. I just got out of an abusive relationship where I was told my death would be the best gift to be gave by me. If I had someone to ask I would, but it‚Äôs just me myself and I
zre6eb,,j1gm4gy,What country are you in? General location?
zre6eb,j16qrfk,,Don't give up and don't give in. Don't give people the chance to talk about you being a failure. Go to a Shelter, talk to a charity about what resources are available. As soon, as you find a, safe public shelter managed by the government, do volunteer work so that people get to know you better.  People will help you if they know you. This means getting a good job, finding roommate for an apartment ect. But get your foot in the door first
zre6eb,j13rj9c,,Look for local resources that might be able to help. ü´Ç
zre6eb,,j14ysay,Of there were any, they would have already used them, sorry
zrd50i,j12x7hz,,Probably because 6 hours is still a reasonable amount of time to be in an airport  Once you‚Äôve been there for like 36 Hours and haven‚Äôt been approached or anyone starting to look at you funny. That‚Äôs when I think I‚Äôd have the confidence you have now
zrd50i,,j1314ps,There's literally nobody working here. It's nuts
zrd50i,,j131bp1,I‚Äôm curious to ask which airport but I imagine you don‚Äôt want to tip it off unless you are in some giant international airport  Always thought it would be neat to find a small cities airport and hangout there and they may get to know you and leave you alone. But that said I always imagine it as like the boarding area, which I imagine airport dwellers don‚Äôt have access to, so I‚Äôm not really sure what hanging around the airport looks like otherwise
zrd50i,,j149jqx,Some airports have all the shops before tsa. I think one in ky was like that
zrd50i,,j163dbi,Alot of those airports close overnight also
zrd50i,,j16eeh4,The smaller more regional ones?
zrd50i,j142aiy,,I spent a few days in San Diego airport. Like others have said if it's big enough just move around every day and no one will be the wiser. Plenty of people get stuck on long layovers so as long as you look like you won't be causing a problem they'll probably just leave you alone.
zrd50i,j13d7ee,,I'm very interested to know how long they let you stay.
zrd50i,j13rf08,,Leave after a while and then go back. If you have different clothing, wear it. This way you might pass for a frequent traveler.. at least for a while
zrd50i,j14z701,,Start up that YouTube channel
zrd50i,,j1fyrfn,It would be boring as shit. The reason this has worked is because this airport is dead as dogshit

zrd50i,j1ogjeq,,A big airport is a good place to stay. With the cancelled flights and travellers sleeping everywhere no one is going to notice you.
zrbw7q,j12rd4s,,Sorry to say, but I think that you need to let your brother hit rock bottom. It sounds like you have helped him in every way that you could, unfortunately he can't have your help. I think that you all just need to let him know that you love him, but you're tapped out. He needs to prove that he's ready to be on his own, and it sounds like he's going to continue to have a rough road. He needs to want to change for himself, he can't do it for others.
zrbw7q,,j12rk2u,Yes that is what we recently did. We stopped paying for his phone bill which sucks but he can still text us with wife at McDonald‚Äôs or Dunkin or wherever. I was just wondering if there were any shelters that anyone knew of in the Chicago area that possibly have social services or something for him. But thank you!
zrbw7q,,j12su4a,I see. I feel for your brother and I really admire you for wanting to help him so much. I don't know if you believe in prayer, but I will pray and hope that he realizes what a wonderful family he has and starts straightening out his life. üçÄüçÄüçÄ
zrbw7q,,j13v3vo,Thank you I do appreciate it!
zrbw7q,,j1672nm,Depending on where he is there's PADS in the suburbs or possibly Pacific Garden Mission
zrbw7q,j1377od,,I feel bad for him but damn, he seems entitled if your family has done that much for his and he can‚Äôt even work part time or something‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sad that giving him money won‚Äôt even really fix anything as he‚Äôs on a destructive path‚Ä¶. You may have to show him some tough love but make sure he has a good jacket and socks‚Ä¶. Maybe a gun pass or regal movie theater unlimited pass so he has a place to keep warm‚Ä¶ you can watch movie after movie with the regal pass‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I‚Äôm currently letting my mother in law sleep in the car but unfortunately she isn‚Äôt greatful for the help and also won‚Äôt let me use my own car when I need it for work‚Ä¶very selfish but I am enabling her less and less‚Ä¶ use to bring her cooked meals and we sent her resume to jobs for her and si she is working now. She is a lousy worker but the cold nights in the car is helping motivate her to work and become self sufficient. Also I use to allow her to live with us til she messed up everything, stole and maxed out my husband‚Äôs credit cards, threatened us etc etc so she really is lucky we give her anything at this point.
zrbw7q,,j13vkdb,Yes that‚Äôs exactly how my brother is. We used to offer him money at one point and he started spending it on expensive hotel nights instead of food and necessities. He would tip people with this money knowing the people he‚Äôs tipping are working and they don‚Äôt need it as much as he does. We are unfortunately going to give him tough love and cut him off for now until he starts to realize. Thank you for the advice on the movie theater I have not thought of that one!
zrbw7q,j12pz64,,PS! He has no car, crashed all of the ones that my family has given to him or sold them for who knows what? We don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs using drugs or not. He has -$40 in his bank account and now probably more. We are not sending him anymore money.
zrbw7q,,j131hld,throw him a tent, some blanket and a bag of food and say " Im done"
zrbw7q,,j13raht,Second with what Tulpah is saying.
zrbw7q,,j13v8ay,See I was actually going to do that as well. But most likely he is going to sell it and still not use it because he doesn‚Äôt understand the situation he‚Äôs in. He tells us his life is going great.
zrbw7q,j145t7x,,He can‚Äôt get a job honestly with his mental illness. He should try for disability but it can take over a year for some to get. He won‚Äôt take medications obviously so your going to have to understand that to him everything he thinks is real.   I would honestly talk to him about what does he want. Does he want to be homeless because if he doesn‚Äôt then he has to do certain things. Explanation for his choices and consequences helps when it‚Äôs done kindly.   I‚Äòm sorry for your situation as it is painful when family you love has severe  mental illness.
zrbw7q,,j14dd3z,Yes exactly, we have tried getting him jobs and he would stay at them for less than a month and get fired or fake some minor injury and blame it on the company to get disability. I just don‚Äôt understand how at such a young age this is how you think. He‚Äôs had it great at one point and I guess the past substance and drug addiction really just made him how he is now. I was just wondering if anyone new of any homeless shelters in the Chicago area with good social workers possibly to help him. But thank you I appreciate the help!
zrbw7q,,j16cvpe,Unless he wants to do what they say their isn‚Äôt much help for him anywhere. Maybe coming up in NY where they are going to force help on those with mental hea problems. Drugs are the ass kicker for people like this as they cause psychosis but take all the pain away. I‚Äôm so sorry again. Perhaps you could get him committed for the rest of the week saying he is suicidal as this weather is coming. He is suicidal to be out there in it.
zrbw7q,j153upk,,Comment will prob get deleted but my job is at Open Arms Ministry  we provide clothing and hot meals and a warm place to stay   unless he is a problem he wont get kicked out   google for address
zrbw7q,,j15d6zr,Thank you for the help! I will ask him if he would go there. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt know if he will be a problem but thank you so much!

zrbw7q,j14xx5k,,He went to a psychiatric hospital? Why be upset over the cost if they could help him?
zrbw7q,,j15d16a,Because he can‚Äôt afford that and we won‚Äôt pay for it. That‚Äôs why. Why spend thousands of dollars on help when he won‚Äôt accept it?
zrbw7q,,j15d81a,Do you have to pay for it? Why would you?
zrbw7q,,j15dgoy,No I don‚Äôt have to pay for it but he can‚Äôt afford it. They‚Äôre going to want money from him. Why send him somewhere he can‚Äôt afford?
zrbw7q,,j15dzpi,? I didn't say to send him anywhere. You said he went to the hospital. I was wondering if it's a psychiatric hospital he went to. There are county hospitals that do not require payment to go in. They bill the individual but ours does not send to collections. One can apply for their program to substantially lower the bills. Even the portion not paid by insurance
zrbw7q,,j15jq56,No he just went to a regular hospital. But it wasn‚Äôt for anything he just used it to sleep there. But actually admitted himself in and told them he was sick when nothing was wrong with him. And now the bill is gonna come to us all because he doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to go
zrbw7q,,j15jvmk,You aren't responsible for the bill. It will go to collections and affect his credit only.
zrbw7q,,j15ds92,Do you understand that everything costs money? They‚Äôre going to bill him or my family for the payments if we send him to any type of mental facility. He won‚Äôt afford it and won‚Äôt pay for it and neither will we. So yeah i will be upset about it because it costs money.
zrbw7q,j15dnqm,,I would not worry if someone refuses to get snap or Medicaid. Unless he's incapable of doing it he'll get snap if he wants to eat and Medicaid if he wants that. Snap leads to a free phone!
zrbw7q,j13r7d3,,Give him resources for mental health counseling and case management. You and your family have done everything you can to help him. But like others have said you cannot help someone who does not want help and will not help themselves. His story is one that has been repeated in multiple cities and is continuously debated on how to help these people or how to get these people to accept help to get them off the street.   One question. Is it possible to try to force him into conservatorship under your family so that you can have him put into a temporary mental health facility in hopes that he will learn that he must help himself?   As someone else suggested. Give him a tent, blankets & also resources and let him hit rock bottom. Unfortunately do not allow him to stay with your family. He needs to go to a mental health facility and want help.
zrbw7q,,j13w08z,We unfortunately cannot send him there because the reason he went to prison was for attempted murder on me and my family. My family is not willing to spend anymore money on any type of rehab or facility for him. He can only do that stuff by himself from now on and he also abuses the mental health facilities and somehow always gets thrown out for who knows what. I can try to send him a tent or blanket but he‚Äôs either going to throw it out or sell it somewhere. Thank you for the advice. We were hoping someone would just know of some homeless shelters we can send him in. But thank you!
zrbw7q,,j14bpby,Thresholds will give it all to him but I agree that he has to want the help as alcoholism and/or drug addiction may be involved
zrbw7q,j14n37o,,He should be eligible for Medicaid and SNAP.  I think you can use SNAP for take out food in Cook County.  He or someone can help him enroll online with no ID. Do you live in he Chicago area?
zrbw7q,,j14pfqu,Yes we live in the Chicago area and so does he. Closer to Cicero, south Austin area. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs eligible for lots of things but getting him to do it is the hard part. Thank you though I will let him know about these.

He needs to be Seen by a doctor and have a full physical and mental health evaluation.  If he isn't on Social Security Disability you should consider that. But most of all, if he is an adult there is very little you can do. You can bring a horse to water but that doesn't mean he will drink it.  In all, as a good person, you should just get him a cheap travel trailer, camper van and let him know if he smashes it up, he, will have no place to live.  You will find out how disciplined he will become. Even with his thoughts and behavior. Holding on to someone and controlling them can make you sick and him sicker. At some point, he will have to be the person who realizes he needs, help and make, his, own discussion to help himself. Not owing anyone money, looking out for himself and living his own life ends up being way better than folks hanging on to him. Also let him know, that if he goes to jail or prison, no one will be there for him. You leave him alone, and he will leave you alone and live his life

zr9djh,j12engl,,DIY "nomad" community. I'm sure other people have had a better experience. My experience was  most of the people were grifters or thieves.
zr9djh,j2xzygn,,>What if you have no car, money or your own tent/camper?. How can you survive and fit in?  Surviving and fitting in are two separate things.  One does not depend on the other.  As generic as that sounds, I'm being specific in reference to Slab City.  If you have no car, you may be hoofing it the 4 miles down to Niland, to get food at the store or the gas station.  Or maybe you hit up friends, or eat at one of the camps that offers free food.  There's almost a free meal every day, somewhere in the slabs (something advertised, or just from someone you know).  You might pay for a Slab Cab ride to town, or you might \*trade\* for a Slab Cab ride to town.  People performing a Slab Cab service, are just other slabbers who have a car... so if you have something they want or need, they'll drive you where you want to go and back.  Plenty of people will pay for their Slab Cab ride by purchasing food on their SNAP card for the cabbie.  There's Randy Randy.  He has no camp of his own.  He sleeps under bushes, raids other people's camps, gets free meth from "friends", and otherwise regularly gets the shit kicked out of him for his efforts.  He's been doing that for years.  If you could have a coherent conversation with Styx, you could ask him how he survives without money, or a camp of his own.  Since his habits revolve around the drugs he can score, he survives mainly by crashing where he is when he is tired (at one of the camps that feeds his habits, or next to the road... whichever).  Actually.... for what it is worth, the meth users seem to take care of each other, in regards to food, water, and meth.  For a while at any rate, until the meth interferes with their ability to interact with other humans properly.  Some people have dug holes in the ground, and covered them with whatever garbage/junk they could score around the Slabs.  Some have built shelters out of pallets.  Tents tend not to last a season out here.... but then again, the sun here is brutal enough to eat tires, so people with vehicles have to cover their tires if they are going to be sitting in one place for a while.  However... on the OTHER side of this coin, many of the farms that grow hay and alfalfa will replace the huge thick tarps the cover the drying bales with... and they literally leave the old tarps on the side of the road for people to take.  Same with the shade cloth the citrus farms use around here.  So... there generally isn't a lack of materials that can be taken from Imperial County, to be used in the construction of a shelter.  Just because you don't have a car or any money, doesn't mean you can't end up with a 30'x30' section of very durable tarping in trade or for free.  Some don't survive.  First.... only about 150 of us stay here full time.  During the season... from November to March, our numbers swell... and then people flee between March and April while the temperatures approach 100F.  Every summer we have between 3 and 6 PREVENTABLE heat related deaths.  IE, again... some people don't survive.  I'm not counting the overdose deaths, nor the "questionable" deaths.  We've got more than our share of unsolved murders, as well as solved ones.  How does one survive here?  By doing what is necessary to get what is needed to stay alive.  Theft is so rampant here, that although there is still public outrage, the general sentiment is that you weren't watching your stuff carefully enough if it got stolen.  A huge portion of the population here believes that if THEY feel their need is great enough, it justifies stealing something "unused" or unappreciated from a neighbor.  The word "Borrow" has a local meaning that differs from it's actual definition.  When someone asks to "borrow" something, it means they intend to keep it.  Getting back what is "borrowed" is next to impossible.  Some will even borrow, and then loan out to others, absolving themselves of any responsibility.  This one guy, Light, borrowed a bunch of power tools from Mojo, when he was staying at her camp.  He then loaned them out to others, and they ALL then "vanished".  He maintains to this day that the tools were not his responsibility from the moment he loaned them out to other people.  He refuses to accept the fact that they were never his to loan out in the first place.  How does one fit in?  **Fuck fitting in**.  Most people here don't feel the way I do (although there are a few who do).  The majority fit in by doing the drugs, drinking the alcohol, and otherwise living the way that most here live.  This place is kind of the "Big Rock Candy Mountain" for meth, and to a lesser degree, getting fucked up all the time.  However... there are still circles, or cliques.  Flamingo camp is almost all strictly LBGQT+ (did I get that right?  I dunno).  Pirate camp is drunk.  When The Handlebar was at Skate Park, it was all about boofing.  If you weren't OK with someone taking their alcohol anally... you didn't hang out or live there.  There's a  depressing music scene here, for anyone who experiences it long term.  During the season, there are multiple places that encourage live music during the week.  Saturday at the Range, Monday and/or Tuesday at Mojo's, Wednesday at Oasis, Thursday at Ponderosa, Friday at Marty's (that's Karaoke though).  What is depressing... is that the same people play the same songs every time... for YEARS!  You'll see/hear them play that song every night they play during the week, every week.  And during the summer, when the events are limited to basically Saturday and Wednesday.. and there are only a few people... the songs STILL don't change.  The music scene here isn't about the music... it is about getting attention, even if for a short time.  Seeing a show at The Range (or rather, watching ***The Range Show***) twice in a row kind of proves this out.  Seeing two shows at The Range, months apart, proves it even better.     This is only one aspect of the attention-seeking behavior exhibited by many of the residents and visitors.  Apparently, fitting in here, means coming up with ways of being the center of attention.   Slab City is unique, in that it is an organic experiment.  There has never been, nor does it appear that there ever will be, any person or organization in charge of the place.  It is a ship that not only doesn't have anyone at the helm... there's no friggin bridge from which to steer.  There isn't a rudder.  Hell, it's not a ship, it's a raft.  There's been people here doing something since the early 1960's.  We have minimal police supervision, and we are **not** self-supporting.  Water has to be brought in from outside the Slabs... we couldn't use well water, even if we could drill a well.  The military tried that in the 1940's... the ground water is hot, and laced with lithium and other materials.  They capped their attempt at a well... and that cap failed... and the resulting pool of water next to the well is now our hot springs.  The canal to our north is water from the Colorado River that is destined for the La Quinta agricultural reservoir (Lake Cahuilla in La Quinta, CA) and it is illegal for people to take water out of it.  The canal to our south, is the "contaminated" runoff canal system for the farm community that makes up the majority of Imperial County.  It is full of the fertilizers and pesticides that different farms use.  [This interactive Irrigation System map](https://mygis.iid.com/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a33cfeb3714f4eb8a1c85320613a2d1b) is kind of cool, actually.  We don't grow our own food... because this community is not made up of people responsible and considerate enough to do this for each other... and farming in the desert gets kind of expensive in regards to water.  That, and where we are, on the slope leading to the foothills of the Chocolate Mountains, we don't have the soil for farming.  We have clay.  Thus, supplies and resources have to be brought in from outside the Slabs.  In the 1980's, the community here was made up of Snowbirds.  It peaked in 1988, when there were some 3000 or so during the season, and virtually no one living here full time.  Now, only a handful of diehard Snowbirds return.
zr9djh,j16i23g,,I grew up nearby both a Rez & an Amish community - most of the rez kids gtfo of there as soon as was humanly possible, there's no jobs, just rampant alcoholism (and now meth addiction, from what I've heard recently). one became a relatively famous musician, but most faded into obscurity.  conversely, the amish kids seemed to enjoy their village - lots of jobs (they mostly built log cabins for sale outside).  as far as I know, most of them stayed in the community, but this was back before the internet was really a thing in everyone's lives so maybe they all left eventually.  no idea.
zr9djh,j1b84eo,,One of our mods u/bongart lives in Slab City. He has talked about it a bit on the sub, you may want to check out some of his posts. I find it very interesting hearing about these communities.

zr5t7q,,j11uz2t,Wow sure is!
zr5t7q,,j11v5fy,I know my bags.  That was one of my first bags.  I still use Teton.  Can't stop. Won't stop.
zr5t7q,,j11vr8j,Impressive. I'd been using a basic Walmart one ($20) because couldn't afford anything else that was only rated to 50 degrees till this past week lol. Huge difference.

zr5t7q,j11wiup,,Wow looks EXACTLY like the park shelter i was staying at for a couple months last spring. trees and everything
zr5t7q,,j11ywek,What city? Originally from Oregon, but convince people I'm back home since Illinois is so similar.
zr5t7q,,j11zuwz,Definitely not in either of those places, at the time i was in Independence, Missouri right outside of Kansas city. definitely gave me some feels looking at this picture though, lots of really bad and also really good nights happened at that shelter i was at. started out sleeping in my car in the parking lot, eventually wrecked that car on the road literally right in front of the shelter. ended up sleeping in the shelter bathroom just to keep somewhat warm.   i met alot of people at that park. one day a random older lady pulled up in a big red truck and just started unloading tons of food and clothes. she said she had noticed i was there everyday and God told her to help me. and she really did help alot.   also one day the shelter was rented out by a HUGE hispanic family for a birthday party. they invited me to eat and party with them! what a fun day
zr5t7q,,j121779,Awesome! Can relate to all that. Been to KC few times last year.
zr5t7q,,j137dxh,Jacomo?

zr5t7q,j127ac6,,Do you have anything to insulate the bag from the ground?

zr5t7q,j11u6lm,,You could get a jackery 240 and an electric throw blanket and put that inside your sleeping bag to keep you warm as well. Then just charge it up at the library each day.
zr5t7q,,j11wr2h,electric blanket and stuffing my clothes with hothands was my savior last winter
zr5t7q,,j11ushk,For sure üëç Stay tuned.
zr5t7q,,j126qjw,Probably no need for something that big - maybe just one of those rechargeable hand warmers for those really brutal nights. Just having a good sleeping back for low temps is good enough.
zr5t7q,,j12bdte,Those are over $200 though lol
zr5t7q,,j12bgat,Got mine on sale for just over $100
zr5t7q,,j12j9s4,How long does it power a throw?
zr5t7q,,j12jgvq,I only put it on the first setting (low) and it usually lasts for a few hours.... I don't turn it on until I'm about to actually fall asleep, but I have woken up a few hours later and it was still on and still warm. So I'm going to take a wild guess and say five. That is when it's 100% charged and by the next morning, it's definitely at zero.  I sleep for approximately 8 hours.
zr5t7q,,j11uxya,Don't start with the electronic sleeping bag nonsense again.

zr5t7q,j16fwe6,,Get something to place under you to insulate yourself from the ground that will help the sleeping bag work even better.

zr5t7q,j1ea4wt,,Nice. Is this in the burbs?
zr5t7q,,j1rdvcb,Yup. Pleasantly surprised how much nature is around.
zr5t7q,j12npxr,,I hope you're not sleeping directly on the concrete. Nit only is it not exactly comfortable but it leaches heat and energy from your body. The thin layer of a sleeping bag won't help much. I bet you back is icy. The tables would be a bit better. Don't roll over in you sleep though. Personally the woods in the background look more appealing to me. Use a tarp (quite cheap at walmart) for a roof, leaves or better yet pine needles if available for ground cover. Quite cozy.and more private.
zr5t7q,,j12rke7,Appreciate the input. Aware of all that. Whatever I post I'm comfortable with at the moment and it's only a tiny snapshot of whatever scenario I'm involved in. Moreso makes sense in larger context of overall journey.
zr5t7q,j12uvld,,ever tried a hammock?  they are so small and light, you could probably get one in your mummy bags stuff sack with the sleeping bag
zr5t7q,,j12vdf3,I haven't, but thought of it. Truthfully my sleeping style is more so firm surface. But sure it wouldn't hurt to have that option available.

zr5du3,j11xj19,,Sorry but 80 k with 4 kids isn't middle class. They had one bedroom for 4 kids before this, they were in the margin for a long time. Still fucked up! Ijs why sensationalize it. I guess the voucher system is broken if your ll can move you out for no reason but I can't help but wonder...a housing voucher is welfare, why why have a fourth child when you're already reliant upon welfare with three? Now she can't work anymore it says because....she has 4 kids that need her attention. I do hope they get another apt based on his income asap.
zr5du3,,j121d5i,I was thinking the same thing. I know $80,000 is considered a middle-income salary, but can you be "middle income" when you're depending on government help to afford a place to live?

zqx7wi,j12mbp3,,It's only obvious you're there to other homeless people and those who work with the community.   Your average housed person is going to assume that car is empty.
zqx7wi,,j12mhnw,Interesting.  That is always a possibility. Whenever I see a car or van, where there is fabric hung up directly behind the driver's seat, I always assume it's someone sleeping in their vehicle.
zqx7wi,j135gzs,,I never thought much about cars with fabric hung behind drivers seat. Never realized it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs home . I am sure lot of people don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt care what the situation is of the person in the adjacent parking lot
zqx7wi,j1280r2,,No idea‚Ä¶I‚Äôve wondered the same thing while both being the one shopping while parking in the far back amongst all the empty spaces and also sleeping‚Ä¶never fails‚Ä¶someone will pull right up next or right behind.  I‚Äôve always had the habit of parking in the back like this. It‚Äôs always easier for me to load up my vehicle without worry of being blocked in on either side.
zqx7wi,j113w7x,,If could be an employee who has to park in the back of the lot. If it's a shopper, it's probably someone who doesn't want their car to get nicked or dinged by other cars or shoppers, who is trying to get more walking into their day, or who wants to make a fast exit from the parking lot. They may park close to you because people are less likely to break into a car parked near another car.
zqu3z5,j10emx6,,Pick a city and stick to it.  That's my advice.
zqu3z5,j0zvkiz,,It's really an individual thing. What's right for one person is not right for another. The best cities that are supposedly good at hoping the homeless are Austin and Houston.
zqu3z5,j11vp6k,,I have been homeless in Sacramento, San Francisco, and Oakland. All fairly big cities. SF and Oakland had good resources but it‚Äôs not super safe on the streets at night. California EBT is pretty generous though

zqu3z5,j0zx0ba,,You can ask questions about food stamps in the sub for food stamps! Luckily there are people who work in that department on reddit. Some states require residency. To use tx as an example, Google will say you have to be here for a year to be a resident, but in the food stamps sub I was told that if a person arrives today with the intent to stay here, that is sufficient for their purpose, but warned me it might be better to get food stamps where you are and then transfer them. Because of differing rules from state to state. Tx doesn't let non disabled people have them for more than three months unless you work at least 20 hours or engage in workforce activity for 20 hours, and we're not the only state with such rules. Something to keep in mind.
zqu3z5,j108qsg,,I appreciate it. First job I ever had in the states was packaging walnuts and cherries on farms in San Jose. No more farms in San Jose now. But the weather was good.

zqu3z5,,j11a13n,Not anymore but 2 years ago i was. When i was homeless lmao. I had a greaat experience tbh  Edit: i wouldve said cali as a whole but OP asked for a city so. Its just one of the only places ive been to where people actually treated the homeless kindly, people came by giving us resources, we had our own little community, the grocery store near by obviously knew I mostly came in to just use the bathroom and they didnt mind. Police only bothered me once, the only thing i wouldnt know ab is showers bc i got damn lucky and worked for a kids soccer league and they gave me a free membership, so I always had a free shower. Theres lots of public parks and trails too for free which were totally awesome to go visit when i wanted to see some beautiful nature, it was great :). I did spend one night like downtown tho n that wasnt so great. I was pretty scared people just kept eyeballin me i thought they was gon try n fuck w me, but other than that.
zqu3z5,,j11cupw,Oh ok, that makes sense. I got off the streets about 2 years ago as well but my apartment is in SJ so I‚Äôm still around. I have a lot of friends who are still on the street. Even just in those 2 years things have gotten a lot worse. There‚Äôs so many of us now and the normies are out of patience and sympathy. I feel like the non profits that are supposed to help us aren‚Äôt managing their resources very well. Plus the high cost of living here makes it almost impossible to get off the streets without government aid or subsidized housing. It‚Äôs not the worst place you could be, but it‚Äôs far from easy mode.   Glad to hear you are off the street and in a better place!
zqu3z5,,j11dq83,Yeah i just made all my money there because everything is way more expensive their so minimum wage at the time was 15 and id been working before but highest i made ever at the time was $11 so i made all my money there and dipped back to texas with a waayyy lower cost of living :) sucks tho that its getting worse now :(
zqu3z5,j12lbs6,,The Best Place to go to if you are homeless is New York City. Their is a limited supply of Middle Class people. The fight to keep people poor and on Welfare is a big Deal that no one talks about. Just find an intake Shelter and then after two weeks your are assigned a Shelter which has Case Managers.  New York does not supply much housing. They mostly have shelters. They call these shelters housing. Most folks don't take New York seriously for permanent housing. They boost about home ownership and reaching homeownership goals. Don't bet on it.  Consider it a temporary place until you get a foothold into a state that provides real housing opportunities. Beware of cliches about housing opportunities. It's all just talk.
zqu3z5,j12mbwp,,California EBT is easy to obtain. Stay out of Los Angeles though‚Ä¶ good weather, and the beach is a nice place to rest your head and there‚Äôs the ocean to keep you feeling relatively clean. Orange County has some safe spots like Irvine, San Clemente‚Ä¶ ofcourse there‚Äôs also Goleta in Santa Barbara where u can get anywhere by bus but Goleta attracts a lot of homeless people and some of them are sketchy‚Ä¶

zqtadx,j11h2en,,Dropping to negative temps here in Kansas and I can't convince my friend to stay on my couch for a few nights. Says he has firewood. Sometimes that ain't enough.
zqtadx,,j12lui0,I didn't even bother to get firewood. The reason being, to make use of a fire, I'd have to make it outside my shelter. Tarps melt after all. Because of this, I'd be giving an option for a little warmth but at the exchange of a -10 windchill. And that's for me. If it's negative Temps for you, than the windchill is likely far worse then it is for me. I kinda feel like having a fire for warmth is a double edged sword.
zqtadx,,j13gw1q,He's using an old stone foundation as a backstop and put up a wind block opposite of the foundation. Fire goes in between the backstop and windbreak, he sleeps between fire and backstop. Fire heats up the stone wall and radiates it back to him. He has a few tarps above backstop for rain shelter but it doesn't go far enough out from backstop to be over the fire. His site is in the woods along the river just outside of town and it's a short walk into the downtown area. Benefit of being around a small town, but the big downside is complete lack of social services.  I've tried to help him get his shit together but he gets a place for awhile then fucks it up over stupid and petty shit and ends up back in the woods. I tried explaining he can have an apartment *and* still go camping if that's where he really wants to be most of the time. What worries me the most is he's *not* an outdoorsman, hardly knows anything about bushcraft and refuses to read up on it or even watch YouTube videos to learn. His campsite was set up by another friend who was worried he'd freeze to death a few years ago and that site just sits there unused until he needs it again. If for whatever reason he was run off from that spot he wouldn't be able to build anything similar. I don't want to give up on him even if he seems to have given up on himself. Just can't get through to him and I'm just waiting for the local convenience store manager to text me she hasn't seen him in a few days as an indication something is seriously wrong.
zqtadx,,j14ku9m,While I wouldn't call myself an expert, I do have a decent amount of bushcraft knowledge and for the most part can survive solely off the land, assuming th3 location is abundant qith wild game and edible plants. Shelters are the first thing you need to learn. From your description, his shelter sounds like it may very well do just fine, assuming he has plenty of warm bedding. No amount of fire is going to help without that. But as long as he is out of the wind, and jas warm bedding, he's got a pretty good shot. Any heat from the fire will leave immediately with that setup, but as long as he can keep the fire going, then he can get warmth from it just fine. Truthfully speaking, you don't really need to know hunting, trapping, and foraging to be able to survive outdoors, if you are also going into towns to get supplies as needed. As long as you have a good sleep system, and a proper shelter, you can make it just fine. I think your best best is to offer him one more time the couch, and if he denies, then tell him that if he gets too cold he's welcome to come by anyway, no matter how late it is. That said, I think he's got a pretty good shot. If his sleep system is good he might even be better off than I am, an I'm pretty sure ill make it okay.

zqqxih,j0zz1bx,,Plans? To be alive Saturday hopefully. I've done everything I can to prepare with a 15f sleeping bag that's stuffed with a fleece blanket, a thick comforter and me, with a tarp shelter to block wind. It's all I can do really. But I have faith God will see me through it.
zqqxih,,j11qdjl,Are shelters not a good idea temporarily? My heart breaks at the thought of anyone bracing the outdoors in that cold weather üò¢
zqqxih,,j12lhdl,Sounds good in theory, but if you've ever been in one you'd understand why some people would rather brave the cold. For one thing, it stinks. Anyone can find a river and wash thier ass but some people don't bother. Second, you might be robbed in you sleep. On that note, many probably have alot they have gathered over time to make survival easier, like a propane stove for example. You'd have to leave all your stuff at your camp to go to one of these places, and if someone happens across it, you might just lose everything. An especially hard loss for me, since I have a solar panel, solar generator, bike, and a number of other things. More than 1000 dollars worth of stuff. No chance I'm leaving it unprotected. Another reason against the shelter is not all of them treat you well. I've heard of some that take your phone, they want to register your information like you're entering jail, food isn't honestly good at all, I can get much better food by holding a sign by the road, and lastly, even if I was willing to consider a shelter, there isn't one nearby. I travel alot, and usually just find a spot to hide out for winter. My current spot this winter is a small town, without even a hotel. Certainly no shelter. So I'd not o ly have to leave behind all my things and risk it being found and stolen, but I'd also have to ride my bike in this cold at least 40 miles to the nearest larger town, and since I have never been there, I don't even know if there's a shelter there. Probably not. Shelters aren't really common in small rural towns, and I'd honestly rather risk freezing that go to a city. Cities suck. Harder to survive, few woods to camp in, less giving people, more homeless competition. It's all around bad. Small towns are the way to go.
zqqxih,,j12yg1d,Thanks for taking the time to explain it to me. I feel like I had a fuzzy idea, but you spelling it helps a lot. I guess I wondered how important is stuff when your life is in peril, but I suppose your stuff sounds quite useful and expensive. Your body and health is worth infinitely more than 1000 dollars, but I guess what will you do after surviving. And I hate how everything nowadays wants your information, didn‚Äôt realize shelters did the same. I‚Äôve volunteered for a pretty decent shelter so I may have a romanticized idea of all shelters when it‚Äôs probably not the same everywhere. It‚Äôs sort of a dream of mine to help people get back on their feet, but I think it‚Äôs *my* own myopic idea of what it is to be on one‚Äôs feet, and not what everybody wants. Anyway, I wish you the very best.
zqqxih,,j14p1q2,I get where you're coming from, and it does seem sort of like I am placing a higher value on property than my own life. However, let me put this another way you can better understand. Suppose you need to enter a shelter to stay warm this weekend. Qhen you come back, your house, car, and everything you own is gone. Now you are homeless. And don't even have a blanket to cover up with. You also jave no money, so you can't buy anything. Now, because you wanted to have a single weekend of warmer conditions, you have avoided being outside in the single digits Temps, but instead are now stuck outside in the 20s-40s without even a blanket. You are in a far worse condition than you were. Now it may seem like I'm blowing it a bit out of proportion, but it's the same for me, I just upscale it for you. Me losing my tent and everything inside it is equivalent to you losing your house and everything inside, including the bed and blankets. Losing your car is the same as me losing my bike. Without the bike an trailer I can't get around anymore, and won't be able to travel to find odd jobs or panhandle for food money. And without a proper sleep system. My life would be in far more danger than if I just take the risk of this weekend. I don't know if you are aware, but it doesn't have to be as cold as this weekend to kill you. 32F. That will kill you without proper supplies. It's nit impossible for higher Temps to be lethal if conditions are right. So basically, I'm not putting property at a higher value than life. I'm considering that without the property life would be much harder, if not impossible. It takes years for someone in my situation to build up the supplies I have. And it allows me to live a relatively comfy life, even though I live outdoors.  If another homeless happens across my camp when I'm not around, all my stuff is gone. That's my house. My transportation. It's less expensive than your accommodations I'm sure, but infinitely more valuable to me because I can't easily replace it and would almost certainly die without it. And all this isn't even taking into account the possibility of finding a bad shelter. I'll agreaa that not all shelters are bad. But if you are under the impression that all are like the one you volunteered at, you are severely mistaken. It's the exception, not the rule.
zqqxih,,j14w22g,I completely understand your position. It‚Äôs too bad you can‚Äôt quickly liquidate your goods temporarily for cash and keep the money in the bank. What if you were able to sell one item, then rent a storage unit to protect your stuff while you take shelter? Just throwing out half baked ideas. Life is expensive to keep together. I feel like one has to work very hard just to live. Are you happy with your situation and the freedom that you have or are you looking for full time work and four walls but you‚Äôre just stuck in your situation?
zqqxih,,j150aps,I appreciate the thought, but the only things I have of any value is a solar panel, a solar generator battery, and a Nintendo switch. Yes I know, the switch is probably unexpected. The first two might be possible to pawn, but I wold be much worse off without them later. Presently, I am able to type this out while laying in my warm bedding. Without the ability to charge my phone, I'd have to travel to town and hope I can find a outlet. And not get chased off for using it. So I'd be out out in the cold to be able to charge instead of being able to charge where it's warm. That said, they wouldn't be worth much anyway. The switch could be pawned or sold. And is the only thing I uave that is worth anything. But if I did, I'd have to sell, because I'd never be able to get it back anyway. All that said, I'm actually pretty confident I can make it through just fine. It's not my first time outdoors in the cold. I've been a vagabond for years. Usually I head south for colder weather. Last year I went to Florida. This year I ended up more towards the middle of the south, but it's still better than up north. I know quite well how to survive in icy or desert conditions and have survived both. The fact that the temp suddenly drops nearly 50 degrees at once is a bit concerning, as it doesn't allow time for the body to adjust, but I still believe I will be alright. As for weather or not I'm content. I am. I live my way mostly by choice really. It's quite nice to be able to live without the constraints of society. No bills, no job, no dealing with people who look down on me. I can do whatever I want. Go where I want. The freedom is quite nice. If I need money, I usually just look on Craigslist. There's lots of easy jobs that anyone can do. I can also find a good spot and hold a sign. "Need food" usually gets great results. In Pennsylvania I once was at a truck stop and was making 80-130 bucks a day, just by this sign and sitting there 8 hours. I miss that spot lol, but it was about to start snowing so I had to head south. I don't drink, and the only drugs I use are caffeine and nicotine. So I don't have anything that would prevent me from actually getting a full time job. I just don't need it. I get to live a life that most people don't. I get to travel the country, see the sights, learn new things, and like this weekend, endure challenges. I remember once in the mountains in Tennessee I was camping and got surrounded by a pack of Coyotes. Normally they are not agressive towards humans so I don't know why they started stalking me. That was a bit scary. I kept a machete and can of bear spray handy and they eventually left without coming in sight of the fire I had. Anyway, enough rambling. My point is I really appreciate the thought, but I'm quite sure I can survive just fine. I've done much to prepare for the coming cold, and I believe I will make it just fine. And if for some reason I were to actually die, I'm fine with that as well. I certainly don't want to, but if God decided it is my time, who am I to argue. What will be is what will be. By doing wverything I can to stay warm I've done my part of the deal. The other half is in his hands.  Btw, on a seperate note, I did mention in in a very small rural town. I just got on Google maps and searched for a shelter. And as I predicted, the nearest city that has a shelter is nearly 100 miles away. It would take over a week to even get there. The cold would already be passed. And I probably would actually die on the side of the road from being unprepared. No, my best option right now is to stay where I am, where I already have a good shelter to block wind, and a warm bed. I do have one other option, and that is to completly block off my shelters openings and light my propane stove I cook with. I'm not thrilled about wasting the propane, since it's a 16 mile trip to the nearest Walmart to buy more, but I'll do it if I feel I might die otherwise. I'd have to let it burn constantly, because the heat would dissipate in minutes if I turn it off, but it would offer a good backup plan.
zqqxih,,j156jpn,Aww thanks for spending your battery life on responding! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre happily choosing the vagabond life. Not chained to a mortgage or a job. I have a cat who wants to be an outdoor cat badly and I have guilt from keeping him indoors. He is safer this way, but I wonder if I‚Äôm depriving him of a happier life. His brother LOVES being indoors and is too shy to venture out too far. I built them a small catio with their own entrance from inside the house, but I wonder if that‚Äôs enough. The outdoor wannabe cat is actually super smart. He knows how to open our doors and childproof cabinet locks. So perhaps you are like my adventurous cat and I‚Äôm more like my shy cat. They are both good cats! üò∫üò∏I hope you survive the cold and continue in your many adventures safely. Thanks for sharing your stories üôÇ
zqqxih,,j1f859r,If you're curious im still alive lol. I don't know what the weather is like where you are, but for me the weather is on an upturn from here. Mostly just up. Last night was the worst of it, and by next Wednesday it'll be 60 degrees, and the reasy of the week remaining upper 60s day an night. It's a nice reward from God for being able to tough out the cold. Hopefully the weather is going to improve for your area as well.
zqqxih,,j1fc4v6,That‚Äôs such good news to hear! Thank you for updating! We have dropped 30 degrees since this morning and it will stay this cold all weekend. My adventure cat doesn‚Äôt understand why the catio door is closed üòø But he probably can tell there‚Äôs radio silence from wildlife outdoors. He usually zooms around the house meowing whenever there are outdoor kitties and squirrels nearby. He‚Äôs just curled up and quiet today like his brother. I hope you continue to stay safe and I will pray that God blesses you tremendously. I always ask God to bless me, and he does. It‚Äôs not always what I think I want, but usually it‚Äôs so much better. Thank you for letting me know you‚Äôre okay.
zqqxih,,j13lgcb,Valid points and things I‚Äôd never realized. But doesn‚Äôt being inside for one night when the wind chill is historically low outweigh the negatives? You could legit die in some of the predicted temps ü´§
zqqxih,,j1f9l2p,You're not exactly wrong, but you also have to think further out. Like I said above, if I had chosen to enter a shelter, and my stuff was stolen, even if there's no guarantee it would be stolen at all, there's always a chance, and if it was, now instead of risking death by making it through the cold, now I'm almost guaranteeing death because I'd no longer have any means to stay warm at all. Of course, there's always the chance I'd come back to find my stuff right where I left it. In such case, nothing would change. But if it was gone, I'd either have no choice bur to permanently enter a shelter, or I really would die. You can survive just fine in extreme weather conditions if you're prepared. But you can die if it's only 40 degrees if you're not. By that logic, the risks outweigh the benefits to me. And I was right, I made it through the night not only fine, but often had to remove my hood beacsue I was sweating. If I'm being honest, I dont think ive ever been outside when it's that cold. I normally travel well south so to avoid the worst of it. But I do have experience in living outdoors, so I was confident I could make it just fine. I even had two backup plans to help increase my chances but didn't need either. Simply remaining out of the wind and in my beefed up sleeping bag was all it took.
zqqxih,,j1g1hjn,I get it. No way you can afford to lose your stuff but man I worry about all you guys and girls out there. I‚Äôm a housed person (and I visit this sub because I like to read about personal finance at all levels and maybe to offer some words of support) and I went to throw the garbage out earlier tonight and was bitter cold.  Hang in there man.
zqqxih,,j1g3qxi,I appreciate the concern it's surprising how many people seem to not have any interest in the well being of thier fellow man these days. It's like anyone who looks to be a lower status, especially someone homeless, isn't even worth putting in thier eyes. The weather won't be an issue for me for the time being. By next Wed it'll be back up to 60, Thursday it'll be nearly 70, and will remain about 70 day and night through the weekend. Of course, there's no such thing as a free ride, and all that warm weather culminates into rain beginning Friday, non stop to midday Sunday. But then again, that's a week away. Weather forecasts are honestly reliable for tomorrow lol, must less a week. Hopefully at least people in other locations will be getting a bit warmer too. Cold sucks, regardless how prepared you are.

zqek2b,j0y2q8h,,Did he not have insurance? Have you spoken to legal aid to sue him? Might be a dead end but might also lead to a little bit of money
zqek2b,,j0za8wu,Agree‚Ä¶something would be better than nothing.   Hopefully, you will not continually be fucked because it‚Äôs insurance and they‚Äôre going figure out what the situation is and they often underpay and take too long to pay out now.
zqek2b,,j0zpgc2,the cops came back to my car while i was waiting for a tow and i asked them again if they had found out whether or not he had insurance and they said they were still trying to figure that out. it didn‚Äôt seem like he did. he was also on probation. so i doubt it
zqek2b,,j11gmum,In most states your own insurance covers the damage if the other driver had inadequate or no insurance (its called underinsured and noninsured coverage). Your insurance company will then sue the other driver. It is called subrogation...you are giving your right to sue him to your insurance company. When you call your insurance company, give them his complete name and address, any other information they need. Do not contact the guy. Do not go to see him, even if he invited you. You have insurance agents that represent you and that is their job. You do nothing except report the incident to your insurer, and take your car to the shop. Ask your insurance company if they will cover a rental vehicle for you. Mine did when my car was in the shop.  Edit: And I'm sorry this happened and you're not having good luck. Maybe it means things can only get better in the new year.
zqek2b,,j0zuekp,If they couldn't figure it out immediately then you're probably right. But in the tiniest of chances I would still pursue it just in case
zqek2b,,j101eig,I wonder if he even had a valid license? People without a valid license or insurance should not be in possession of their vehicle. So many do this shit and they get away with it. The loser could care less if he goes to jail.
zqek2b,j0y0g03,,At least 95% of people would be broken after everything that has happened to you, you are a very strong person for even staying sane..  I know im just a stranger on the internet but I am proud of you and I bealive in you.

zqek2b,,j0zpl91,i dont think he had insurance. still working with mine
zqek2b,,j106lvn,I hope you had comprehensive or more than just liability? Good vibes you have coverage for this. This is why liability ony is not worth it most of the time
zqek2b,j0ybf7k,,People say too save money, do they realize how cold it is outside? My entire paycheck goes too hotel rooms, but it‚Äôs better than freezing to death!

zqek2b,j101708,,This is why the homeless life sucks, and so many homeless are a total burden on society. Its always the shitty ones that ruin it for the good ones. Dont bother with motels they are too expensive and will drain you and take your money, Find a room to rent and a bike for now but this is why full coverage on vehicles is necessary because so many dipshits have no insurance at all. I am guessing he was not insured?    Beg friends and family if you can stay with them for a month or 2 to work and save money....hotels are not sustainable.
zqek2b,j10s8yb,,A roommate borrowed my car once while I was sleeping and got into a wreck. She wasn't charged with the accident. I got a settlement and she got one too because she was injured. Contact your insurance company.

Hmmm, at least you have funds for a hotel room. I know you were planning on saving and saving.. But you're at this job, ask around for rooms to rent on the cheap end, close to work. If anything, pay a coworker weekly to come and pick you up and drop you off.  If you go after this guy, which you can't now cause he is locked up..Your anger will weaken and weaken from day to day. You're WORKING!! Pay is decent, get a month or two under ya belt and continue to ask around for cheap rooms off the books. Hit up laundromats and supermarkets bulletin boards. Hey a couple of blank 8x10 pieces not paper and hand write  what you are looking for and post around. Something will come up. Plenty of people who can use the extra cash for a border for a couple of months.  Keep your head on tight, swivel. Don't do anything that's going to get you or make you stop moving forward. It's hard, I know..believe me I know. Been there and done that on a level that's 10 steps below where you are at now. But one thing you will learn out if all that you're going thru... Forgiveness. Starts with you first.

zq9fr6,,j12tmem,I am right there also. Same situation.  But my starter is acting up.  Need a motor mount , and trans is slipping at times.  Lol . I laugh and then i start to tear up.  I suffer alot. This life has treated me very poorly.  I have shiit for luck . Shiit for eduaction. High school only abd what i have learned in the real world. The Hard Knock life they say.  When most people were headed to college i was Headed to prison for something i got cought up in 25 years ago. Still my background kept me from jobs housing and all kinds of oportunities  So i was deprived of NORMAL . Still am.  I was just 21 at the time. Now at 46 im still being Looked at as a convicted fellon.  What bullshit.  Alot of these laws are crazy . Keeping records for that long . Life ruined early. Anyways,  I pray alot. I try and Hold my head up high.  I do realize others are missing legs and arms.  Some are in wheel chairs and excetera.  But we all have our own pain and suffering.  I feel mines just as much as a wounded soldier.   My Father was a Joke. Never around  Never teach me anything.  Fathered about 7 kids  And didnt take care of not 1.  Yet he came around so often to ask we "Kiss His Hand"  "Besa me la mano"   latin saying when a father denands respect and attantion.  Sick fcxk.  I grew up so fucking confused. Struggleling with my owb identity around so many mentally abusive mother fucking family members.  Mom was knocking on doors as a jehovahs witness and didnt care to be a mother to me.  She was gone 40 hours a week preaching and and handing out watchtower and awake magazines , then bible studies. It was over kill. I either see her comming or going. Its almost like that religion is ab overkill of worship. And if you not baptized no one wants nothing to do with you. EXTREMISTS . worried about everyone else besides her own son. She is a Religious Narsissist . And a Horrible  Human being. Hiding behind her cult.  My Sister is a TOXIC person. Always looking to argue . Always looking to instigate. You can see the hatread in her eyes.   I dont have anyone. Those people i mentioned are the types to make you feel worst in your hardest times. No support No sympathy , no love, . Staying away from toxic drama and BS while being down in life like i am is the best thing for sanity.    I dont have any kids or a spouse.   When the money is gone is when you find out who is on your side. I have no one now.  She seen me at my worst and said Good bye.   Just glad i bought these SKI Pants that are keeping me warmer . Oh and i have NEVER received any gifts from my family.   Plus never any hollidays celebrations.  So i have NEVER received any help , gifts , money , nothing. No one ever thinks of me.  I am DEAD to everyone and the world.  Jehovahs witness NEVER celebrate hollidays.  My life has never been the normal or traditional.  Its always ME bymyself Suffering or with a woman whom i know is on her way out.  (Just a matter of time. My past experiences have tought me that no woman will stay for ever,  I have never married.    My reddit pals on here , you know who you are.  I thank you for being the brothers i never had.  The family i never knew i loved.  You guys have been my Solid ones.  PS. ITS COLD AND WILL GET COLDER.  IF I DIE IN THIS VEHICLE WHILE I SLEEP OR FREEZE TO DEATH IM OK WITH THAT.  IM TIRED.  IM REALY REALLY TIRED OF IT ALL..   But with my luck i will wake up starved.  Hungry and wanting to eat. I got half a pack of cigaretts and  quarter tank of gas. $4.00 bucks And new ski pants on.

zq7980,j0x0c5u,,look into the tenant and squatters rights in your area, you may be surprised at the amount of time you can stay. try to get everything in order before you give up the property. I don't know much about Europe or what it's like to be homeless there. It sounded like you haven't lost your job yet, is there time to line up something new? even just temporary work?
zq7980,,j0xivvw,Someone dm'd me with some resources and a post from Reddit where one squatter who lived in Spain was surprised by how many empty houses there are here, specially near the coastline area, apparently in Spain there are like 1.500.000 empty houses, it's sad there are so many empty houses yet so many homeless people. And yeah I'm trying to find something but I live in a relatively small city so there aren't many opportunities maybe I should try my luck with Burger King or McDonald's but I don't think they're hiring anymore. The thing is there are very few jobs and most of them require a qualification I don't actually have like technician, programmers, developers... So the more "normal" jobs that I can actually do have a shit ton of candidates for a single place. There was this job opportunity in a clothing store where there were like 2 places left and 1500 people showed up
zq7980,,j1jmi2o,well if you‚Äôre losing your job & housing anyway & you have a bit of money saved, why not just leave your area? either go way rural to find a job that provides housing or go to a more urban area to find a better paying job. you still have your current address to use on applications & such. i‚Äôve escaped homelessness multiple times by being not afraid to move, even if it‚Äôs out of state.

zq1tv4,j0z8o7f,,It would be nice if the state recognized home ownership, with small businesses. The state does not recognize businesses that are not linked into some kind of government program. It is a handicap for Proprietors because the state feels as if it has to have a hand and everything they are doing. The state demands that you give them an explanation for your small business, even if it does not have to be registered with the state. And this is truly over regulation, with consequences. While big and time Real Estate Investors can top of your business damage it, and walk away Scott free. They want the state to put small businesses owned by single people out of business and put them on welfare on the streets. Then they talk about home ownership, small minority businesses, and what they are doing. It seems so hypocritical. It seems as if they wanted a dual Society, and which only certain groups could enjoy the freedom of doing business without regulations or unorthodox regulations, While others have to be pinned to all kinds of regulations including ones made up in the mind of a psychopath. The contribution to a slow growth economy, and all other deficits comes from this nasty attitude, that everyone will pay the same taxes, but only certain groups will have all of the freedoms, and the Restless live under socialism or some sort of dictatorship. This is not what we voted for.
zq1tv4,j0woykd,,Doesn't ny take in millions of refugees from the south? RIP NY. How does it help their own homeless. The system is set up to make it even harder for the homeless to exist. Seems like it.
zq1tv4,,j0z7mtb,They really have no choice where to stay. There are States that do not tolerate immigrants even Asylum Seekers. Under federalism, and the right of each state to police itself, each state can make its own laws with regards to tolerance for illegal immigrants and Asylum Seekers. If an asylum Seeker is not granted immunity, being returned to their country, they can still find a way to live in a state that does not Deport them back to their country. Life is not always Fair, the course may not Grant some people immunity from deportation under the same circumstances. By going to a state that does not Deport them, they are guaranteed the ability to stay someplace safe.
zq1tv4,,j114j2c,Refugees didn't choose to come to NYC. They were bussed here by southern states. Southern states used it as a "gotchya" moment because NYC is so liberal - we are a sanctuary city and one of the few cities/states with a right to housing.
zq1tv4,,j0ws4vd,It's like that everywhere, including here, and I'm in a cold state also.  Why would immigrants wants to come to the North doesn't make sense to me
zq1tv4,,j0wv7yq,[deleted]
zq1tv4,,j0ziq5n,The rest of the state subsidizes NYC? Are you joking? NYC makes so much money that most of it gets sent to failed Southern Republican welfare states. This is a fact, not an opinion.  They choose not to spend that money on immigrants or the homeless. You‚Äôre being told immigrants are the problem but the rich and powerful determine where that money goes, not desperate immigrants.
zq15rr,j0vu2cq,,Most of the these you don‚Äôt need to test for unless you‚Äôre having active symptoms like a fever or sore throat. To be proactive, you could ask to check on your vaccinations. Shots for flu, hep, Covid, plus all the other usual ones (measles, etc.) could protect you in the future and maybe help you feel less worried about catching anything.  If you‚Äôre older or have particular concerns though, talk to your doctor about what they recommend. For people in their 40s or older, chronic diseases (like heart health, diabetes, etc.) are more likely to be a concern vs. infectious disease. Checking your blood pressure, doing a glucose challenge test, a CBC (complete blood count), and a cholesterol test would all be normal things to ask about if you‚Äôre above around 40 or have other risk factors.  I‚Äôd recommend though, talking to your doctor about your living situation and ask what they‚Äôd recommend for tests or other advice.  They probably know what‚Äôs potentially circulating in your local area. Hang in there!

If you go to a food bank maybe grab a little bit extra for someone else. If you're going to do laundry and you have room, ask if you can wash a blanket or some clothes of theirs. If you see any free blankets being given away take them or take a couple. Blankets can be used to keep the cold out as well as keeping someone warm.

zpk655,,j0wab3y,Socks. I've read that socks are good. This is from an "I used to be a homeless person" post that's going to be almost impossible to find.  Also, underwear. And undershirts. They help wick away sweat and keep people from freezing, because if your only layer gets soaked you're in trouble.   If you can't afford any of that, maybe just bring a hot drink or soup. Hard to warm things up when you're homeless. Some people are suspicious of food, though. You can ask if they want anything warmed up, if you're able to do that.

zpevs3,j0sjo7n,,My life improved when I stopped going to therapy altogether. I was diagnosed PTSD and just about everything else. Therapy was always traumatizing to me. After my last bad experience I gave up altogether and started focusing on my self care. It seems I lose all my power and give it to the therapist. Therapy is too expensive and they don't guarantee anything. I would focus on building your coping skills. Therapists never taught me that. Instead it was them wanting me to talk about the same trauma over and over.
zpevs3,j0sp281,,I feel ya.  I was homeless for years and when I git a place I didn't know what to do. It took me almost 2 years to adjust. I have a similar situation with the past trauma and trying to rebuild from nothing.  I moved in with a backpack of clothes and had to figure it out.  It's a struggle, there will be setbacks. Just remind yourself that you have a place now and it may take awhile but you can rebuild. As far as my past I've spent tons of time just thinking on everything.  Eventually I seen where the mistakes I made were, realized that there's nothing I can do about what others have done to me, so needed to find new ways of handling stuff.  Hope things work out
zpevs3,j0t7k16,,You know I‚Äôm kinda feeling ya here‚Ä¶only been in therapies and counseling.  I got to say, that I enjoy going and having a one on one, but for the time, money, energy, and effort‚Ä¶little return.  I‚Äôve also done the group DBT, which was enjoyable to a point, but again lots of drawbacks and even though the zoom was supposed to be secure‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not certain it really was all that secure.  In any case, you can practically do DBT coursework yourself anytime‚Ä¶beats waiting around.  Just pull out, sort through what‚Äôs helpful and throw out what isn‚Äôt.  Keep things simple for sure, I really like the Diet, exercise, sleep and all suggestion. Excellent place to start. Get those worked out and you‚Äôll have the energy to start tackling other things.
zpevs3,,j0vuw6k,DBT saved my life, but I agree about the group aspect. I never enjoyed it. Too many different personalities and levels of motivation. Some people really aren‚Äôt ready to face their issues head on, especially with DBT which is focused on the actions you take and not just thought patterns, etc.  I also lucked out and found a DBT place that accepts Medicaid which is mostly impossible in the US.
zpevs3,j0tkyd7,,Your starting a new journey of your life. Living on the streets unfortunately isn't rainbows and puppies and most of us end up with scars on our bodies, hearts and souls. Your just scared,and that's PERFECTLY normal. I know one of my biggest fears is ending up back on the streets and a lot of us are one bad day away from it. Just give yourself time. Now that you finally found a safe space of your own,just take time to adjust and than if you feel ready,start slowly working on rebuilding your life and yourself. Some homeless people that spend too much time on the streets essentially can become "institutionlised" like those that spend too much time in prison) and it takes a while to readjust. If your feeling guilty,that's essentially "survivors guilt"(why couldn't my friends who died make it? Why are my other friends still suffering?,etc) There's also nothing wrong with, but you DONT have to feel guilty because you got a chance. You did that,it was meant for you,and perhaps one day you can rebuild yourself to be in a position to help someone in the same position. Just take your time,validate your feelings but try to figure out exactly WHY your feeling them(our feelings are always valid,just need to learn which ones do us good or do us harm.)  Like any recovery it's a day by day,step by step process and life has this funny thing it likes to do(at least w myself and others I know) is EVERY time we try to get our lives together and strive to get better it usually starts off with 2 steps forward,5 steps back...just keep putting one foot in front of another. You'll create that hilltop one day.  One of the easiest ways I found to get out of negative thinking patterns is Start small again. At least once a day find something your thankful for(being warm and safe,having food/clean water,watching a beautiful sunrise,having a day without pain,etc) Say it outloud. Keep a journal,and watch your journey If u do that everyday,it becomes easier and easier and 'essentially starts to rewire the brain(repetitive actions). Maybe try and set up a new routine. Wake up have a hot shower, have a cup of something warm and yummy,read a book,go find a thrift store and get some silly things to personalize your space. Just breathe, keep your chin up,and just keep taking one step after another,day by day, and some people are saying therapy didn't work for them. Having a counsellor get me through my roughest,darkest patch was honestly one of the few things that kept me going. Just having a stranger thats trained for this to unload on,sometimes is all that's needed(the only time they Can break client/practioner confidentiality is if you admit to a crime or say u want to hurt yourself) if u find one that you don't like there's Many online for free or close to free. Good luck and also remember..it's okay to make mistakes,and it's okay to feel scared/worried  Good luck!

zpevs3,j0sji5p,,Take better care of yourself. Real whole foods, make sure you're exercising, physical health is very related to mental health etc. You either break or get tough through trauma, that's up to you. Get right with God, pray, keeping divine justice and salvation in mind are key to coping through the darkest times.   Get healthy hobbies, don't just consume TikTok all day. I like playing guitar and singing and playing chess or hunting and fishing, but my wife likes baking, whatever allows you creative expression and that focus that brings you to the moment, or stuff that brings you outside in the sunshine.
zpevs3,,j0t7r13,Mostly yeah.
zpevs3,j0tis6p,, Are ANY shelters a good place?? I've spent over a decade homeless & never stayed a single night in one, for good reason.
zpevs3,j0tnwgw,,Benzos
zpevs3,j0vy51i,,Honestly, try DBT. I‚Äôve been doing it for a while now and we hardly ever talk about details of trauma or the past. That‚Äôs just not the focus.  Instead we talk about strategies, coping skills, it‚Äôs focused on taking action. Definitely not talk therapy, which is what it sounds like you have done.   Also, remember that there are tons of different modalities of psychotherapy. Do research if you want; it‚Äôs actually really interesting on a purely intellectual level.   I don‚Äôt know anyone who manages a chronic mental illness without therapy. Of course it‚Äôs possible, but like with most alternatives to mainstream treatment, you have to be super intentional about it.   On a different note:  I‚Äôve been hospitalized twice in the past 3-4 years and you‚Äôre right, it is kind of like being in jail.   I am facing homelessness and also have realized that my life never rebalanced after my last breakdown, quitting my job, financial dependence on family, etc. In a lot of ways, this is my rock bottom.   Trauma is very real too. I regularly dream about, and think about the people I used to work with and what happened. Panic when I think I‚Äôve seen someone in public. Even when I see someone who just looks like them, I get freaked out. I even avoid the town I used to work in as many of my former coworkers lived there. It‚Äôs textbook. So, I get it‚Ä¶  Best of luck to you.
zpevs3,j0y5csl,,I relate! This year has been the worst year of my life‚Ä¶ every time I thought things can‚Äôt get worst, they did! I am suffering from PTSD and lost my job, then someone I trusted saved me from a suicide attempt only to tell me that he took my clothes off when I was sleeping and I have no memory of that but I had his text message admitting that so I called the police who made me feel it was my fault for inviting him, and me explaining I invited him because I needed someone to talk to as I was in the middle of self harm‚Ä¶. The police made me feel worst, then tried to arrest me, then eventually get told that my rape kit results were inconclusive despite still having that text that the guy sent me that he took advantage of me when I was sleeping‚Ä¶. Wtf ü§¨‚Ä¶ I still will never know what really happened as obviously I haven‚Äôt talked to that guy since but I became homeless and with my mental health/ depression‚Ä¶ no one would help me‚Ä¶.  I was homeless for awhile before my ex was kind enough to let me stay with him and I should feel lucky and happy but instead I feel like a burden, depressed, I feel like the world just exploited me and that I was dehumanized‚Ä¶ I have panic attacks‚Ä¶. I was excited about getting a new job but on the first day having a panic attack and rushing out‚Ä¶. Then sending an email asking for another chance‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs such a shitty feeling‚Ä¶ um üòê well I guess what I‚Äôm trying to tell myself is that it‚Äôs December 2022 of the worst year of my life and I‚Äôm trying hard to tell myself that this is the end of the chapter and just telling myself that words are powerful so I need to take control and that I‚Äôm entering a new chapter and things are finally getting better ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π  I think this will be the hard part but we both should be trying to get as much therapy as we can get and also some guided meditation that is positive because right now I bet being alone in your thoughts is a dark place‚Ä¶. I know mine is‚Ä¶. Living in the past is dark and scary‚Ä¶. Thinking of the future may also be scary and bringing us anxiety so try not to think of that either‚Ä¶. Instead, we both should just appreciate that the hardest days are over right now we have a roof over our head and we have enough‚Ä¶. If you catch your thoughts going to a scary place take back control. We both will need to do a hard reset‚Ä¶. And if we think of the past, we must tell ourselves we are triumphant, tenacious, or victorious for surviving it. Positive things are more likely to happen to positive people so it‚Äôs sink or swim my friend. Let‚Äôs choose to swim.

zpdkur,,j0vb63k,We had our first trial. My slumlord and I had an agreement via text before that if I was out by December 1st he wouldn't take me to court. I held up my end... The judge didn't appreciate him not holding up his end. I managed to disprove that the damages were my fault. The judge "to be fair" dropped his claims of late fees and damages but still awarded him back rent but specifically told me (and gave me the look telling me I should) if I'd like to appeal I have 10 days to do so. I'm thinking I should since I'd at the time forgotten I had made a partial payment for one month plus the security deposit which would cover the other month.
zpdkur,,j0vf365,so is this small claims or no? Normally in small claims there is no appeal. You can try legal aide but there resources are extremely limited. Unless you have money for an attorney I doubt this will go anywhere.

zp6hl7,j0r7k4t,,>	and I‚Äôm saving up to buy land   Excellent foresight. Most people believe you have to buy an expensive house in the city somewhere and set their goal on a property that will cost them a million dollars over their lifetime.   Purchasing a couple acres of rural land and improving it can be a much better option over the long run, especially if you can improve it with multiple dwellings in mind.   There‚Äôs nothing like turning a couple acres into a long term camping area with $300/mth parking for a dozen ‚Äúcampers‚Äù.
zp6hl7,,j0rc7a9,It's either buy some land or buy a foreclosed property at auction for a few thousand dollars. It can't be worse than living in a car.
zp6hl7,,j0rm9js,If you're a Veteran, you can apply to the USDA for assistance and they can help you use a VA Home Loan to purchase land, and the only requirement to avoid the down payment is to add an inhabitable structure w/in a year.
zp6hl7,,j0romrn,Better to get a loan for the land and the building then refinance it with the home loan guarantee.
zp6hl7,,j0rp8ie,If you qualify for a traditional loan. I can't w/out the VA HL. All i have to do is put a stand alone mobile home on the property, mark off some camping spots and rent those out, and after a yr, i can remortgage/refinance and improve the home and/or property.
zp6hl7,,j0v3kxa,Yeah, it's tricky to use the VA HL these days though. You have no buying power. I have been trying since 19. The buyers will say they want to sell to a veteran then sell to the highest bidder. Also, the restrictions for the VA HL exclude mobile homes. It has to be a fixed structure and at a minimum size. That puts most houses on the market either do not qualifying for the VA HL or are priced too high. The sad reality is that even with a rating of 100%, I have yet to find anything I can afford to live in that is little better than the set up I have now.
zp6hl7,,j0ti0hq,They won't help you buy land. I looked into this years ago.
zp6hl7,,j16lf2u,So did i. If you start w the USDA and get approved, they can help get w getting the VA HL on board, but like i was told, you have to have a mobile home, or better, on the property w/in the year, and live out of that for 1yr.

zp4cic,j0qtkqx,,A five dollar bill. I know I've said it before on this sub, but the thing that gives me the most comfort is having a bit of cash on me to buy what I need when I need it. If you break your shoelace, if you need to buy advil for a throbbing tooth, if you need to buy bandages for a popped blister, to be able to buy food on a dollar menu during a downpour or an especially cold night gets you out of the weather for a short bit, the list goes on. Having a five dollar bill on you is a get-out-of-trouble card.   It weighs nothing but it can mean the difference between life and death. I highly recommend.

So you can cut them into individual packets or leave them as a pack of two. They can be used in pockets & under blankets for 8 to 12 hours. They can also be wrapped in Saran wrap and they will reheat again a second time. Not as hard as the first time and not as long. But it does work a second time if you take out all the oxygen and let it sit for a few hours.  Gift certificates for places like McDonald's or Wendy's or any other place just to keep warm and have a hot meal or a hot drink.   $5 prepaid gas cards.

zp3dlz,j0ryxt0,,I was homeless for \~5 years, might well be homeless again in the future, and I definitely have mental health issues.  Complex PTSD, ADHD, a learning disability, PMDD, depression and anxiety.  Plus the total lack of supportive family/friends when shit got real.  I also think the experience of homeless itself, whether it was the endless series of friends I had to sit through coming up with BS reasons to eject me from their lives, needing to constantly be on guard to protect yourself, how people treat you and think of you, was traumatizing on its own.  I'm a different person after the experience, and even less functional than I was before it happened.  America's homelessness crisis is as much about a system that deliberately crushes and punishes those who can't be hyper-productive capitalistic tools (i.e. those of us with mental and/or physical disabilities) as it is about soaring housing prices.
zp3dlz,j0s6y5k,,Yeah. I got some pretty heavy diagnosis, especially recently. They're the reason I can't really work a normal job, and why I've been homeless for so long now (7 years and counting.) I'm trying to fix my shit up but right now I'm in a shelter and trying to fix my shit so when I do find a place I can keep it.   It makes it hard to live, hard to stay sober.
zp3dlz,j0t1rgr,,I suffer with mental illness I wish people were nicer they‚Äôre so cruel I really wish there‚Äôs a God so he can punish these assholes who are so mean to me üò≠
zp3dlz,j0rkqzt,,I'm diagnosed bipolar but I'm convinced I have BPD. Being homeless is incredibly difficult with mental health issues. I felt bullied in high-school and a bit after too. I think I'm an easy target for abusive people, so I just attract that kind of attention. It's definitely hard for me to stay alive too. I think of suicide every day. My parents won't take me in and are emotionally abusive. I don't think they would care all that much or at all if I killed myself. They are narcissists and might pretend to care in order to get sympathy and to seem like decent people. I'm pretty sure it's all an act with them though. On top of having a difficult time being homeless with mental illness, I'm pretty sure I have long covid and my physical and mental health are worse because of it. I actually feel like I have brain damage. I can't read as much as I used to be able to, and I can't focus on what I'm reading for as long. It's also making it more difficult communicating with people when I need to buy food or talk to staff at a shelter. Life is hard. I don't see any way out of this for myself. I might eventually buy a tent when I just can't deal with people anymore. I don't think I could actually kill myself.
zp3dlz,,j0rvx2y,Have you considered going to an emergency room? You shouldn't have to live with suicidal thoughts every day. I did for a while, and it sucked. The ER can help you get seen for your long COVID symptoms, too.
zp3dlz,j0stzj7,,Yes I do. It‚Äôs hard so I see you
zp3dlz,j0t8ytd,,Well‚Ä¶mine wasn‚Äôt school per say, but worked in a warehouse for well over 10 years that was a highly toxic work environment and still is.   I‚Äôm just out due to health reasons for now and still have issues.   Honestly, it‚Äôd be worse than the military if they had showers.  I struggle a lot, but I‚Äôve made it pretty far to be honest‚Ä¶probably due to a poor memory, still, somethings stick with you.

If you have a facebook there are groups you can join in your city or town that can help get your apartment furnished. One is called buy nothing with your city another might be everything is free. Look up your citys groups. We got our whole apartment furnished from our group and had everything we needed donated and it was a lot. The only new things were our beds and kitchen set. Our apartment is amazing and its so awesome for my kids and I to be alone. I am so happy for you. Enjoy your new place. ü•∞
zosx9l,j0q8q7d,,"Enjoy your workout?" What the hell? You work at Planet Fitness, you're also one car accident away from being homeless. Cheap gyms have been THE way the homeless get clean. We don't use up your equipment, we don't sit there recording ourselves,  we don't have loud as conversations on speakerphone. We use your shower and we get out. We're your best client.
zosx9l,,j0qzzcj,I work at planet fitness. Corporate tells us to say this to everyone, even if they aren't working out
zosx9l,,j0rwh9l,I really appreciate that information. I had no idea and I clearly projected my less-than-great experience onto OP. Thank you for that. It really put things into perspective for me. That doesn't negate the looks OP was talking about, but if you're already in a defensive mind set, you might mishear a neutral comment as something negative.
zosx9l,,j0s4064,Takes a special kind of person to have this kind of humility you do. You're a good person
zosx9l,,j0uirmz,Well, thank you, but no. If you hadn't been kind enough to tell me this, I might have made a real ass of myself the next time someone innocently made this comment. You made me a better person, I'm still working on good.
zosx9l,,j0ulcmz,I personally don't say it to everyone that comes in unless corporate is there. They look like normal people. But they often aren't wearing workout clothing and aren't in the pf uniform. We get graded on our performance and that is technically part of it
zosx9l,,j0qcgye,OP wasn't a paying customer.
zosx9l,,j0qe1h9,Everyone is entitled to the free day pass and still is using less services this way. Might end up buying a membership, which is the point of the free day pass. The guy would prefer he'd stayed longer? Just being rude
zosx9l,,j0qv54c,Entitled.    It's fine to be annoyed by other people's behavior. It's fine to express it (like what OP was doing with his post; same thing).
zosx9l,,j0qs15a,Because he was on a pass? If you turn in your punch card for your free coffee, are they allowed to spit in it?  I am a paying customer and I've gotten some serious attitude by staff. Yeah, I'm here for a hot shower, that's one of the products you offer. That's what I'm paying for. I don't come in with bags full of stuff. My clothes are fairly clean, but they're not workout clothes, which is the dead giveaway. Fine. But to have some kid give me crap about trying to stay clean and healthy when I AM PAYING FOR THE PRIVILEGE,  why, what the hell do you get out of that power trip? I'm already as low as I can get. Yeah, this post obviously struck a nerve.   I hope you get the love and respect you deserve OP. We are all deserving of a little respect and dignity. We don't need to be shamed for trying to get by any way we can.

zosur7,,j0qw5qd,thanks, i definitely will do this!
zosur7,j0skt5x,,One suggestion that I'm not sure if it would be good or bad, but I'm going to throw it out there. What about leaving a note on a car that is parked in the same place for multiple days such as Walmart and letting them know that you have some warm items that you would like to give out and if they would like one, you'll be there.... The next day at 4:00 p.m. And will be parked in / near X, if anyone wants one.
zosur7,,j0trxsa,Sounds like a good idea!
zosur7,j0p9llv,,It‚Äôs kinda up to you, either way they will likely end up in the hands of people who need them. Some people might be looking to help a specific group, such as mothers with children or veterans, for example. In that case it makes sense to donate to an organization that serves that group. Some people like to pass out their donations personally and see exactly who is benefitting from their gift. Giving directly to individuals is often more rewarding but can also be time consuming.   Where I live I know of at least one organization that goes out and distributes donations to people on the street and in encampments and they allow donors to go out with them to hand out items. Something like that is kind of the best of both worlds. In the end, there is no right or wrong here. There is plenty of need everywhere so your items will likely be put to good use.
zosur7,,j0qw4fh,thank you for the answer. i think the reason homeless are difficult to find (most of the time) here is because this place really isn‚Äôt all that hospitable and a more transient city. a report i read said there were under 200 documented in the whole city. if i end up unable to come across anyone i think i‚Äôll look for warming shelters like other comments suggested. i‚Äôll also research if there‚Äôs any organizations like you mentioned here
zosur7,j0p2gky,,Not seeing them is common, I'm in a large city with a large homeless population but you'll rarely see them sleeping on sidewalks or under bridges unless you know where to look.  If you can get it directly to the people in need that's the best, but not always possible.  I was never on the street, I always found a place to go wether it was halfway house, a long term shelter, a rehab or at the end which was a year and a half ago until  3 weeks from yesterday, transitional housing.  If you're going to donate to a place I'd avoid the larger institutions and give to the church based and smaller places as in my experience they are better at getting things to those that need them.  The transitional housing I'm in is run through the YMCA and they're assholes, there are rooms filled with donations that they are hoarding rather than giving them to the people coming in that have nothing other than the clothes on their back. They stick you in a room that has a stove, but you're lucky if there was a single pan left in the cupboard, you get a blanket thats supposed to be decorative (the light weight type with all the holes woven into it people normally throw on the back of a chair) 1 plate, 1 bowl a fork and a spoon and that's it.  I've been in a room that was full of like new pots and pans that were donated that they saving for god knows what, the Y has money but this place is in the worst repair of any of the places I've stayed, nothing works and no one cares...  Sorry about the rant, just pointing out that you have to check out where you donate to.
zosur7,,j0pxpwr,Rant yes, but with helpful info for sure. Thanks!  Never heard this particular side of the Y before. I‚Äôve volunteered before with events and such and there are a few in my area‚Ä¶surprisingly, the one downtown is much nicer than I had ever expected.  During my volunteering time I had noticed some of what you‚Äôre describing‚Ä¶there was certainly a bit of stinginess here and there, but nothing from my perspective (I was assigned to specific areas) so I didn‚Äôt see much.  I can say that facilities involving paid memberships were kept up nicely at this location.  It was the management that really creeped me out‚Ä¶they were just‚Ä¶cultish and a bit too judgmental at times.  Yes, always check out where you donate too!  Thanks for sharing.
zosur7,,j0qvjzg,yeah, thank you for sharing! i wouldn‚Äôt have considered that some orgs are incredibly stingy with donations. that‚Äôs really messed up how everything is in disrepair.      i think i‚Äôll try to spot anyone on a drive but if i don‚Äôt, i‚Äôll look for warming shelters and churches that posted info. i‚Äôll also ask the big mission we have in town if they need supplies. the city government has only officially announced that this one shelter and the salvation army will be open for help, but i‚Äôm sure there are more out there.
zorqpk,j0ozygi,,Sorry to suggest this, but would it be easier to support just you and your sis on your own?

It may not seem feasible now; however, there‚Äôs just so much more that is likely available to you‚Ä¶being young helps in a lot of ways.  Now is the time to look into this if you want to get out of the cycle.  Please look further into it‚Ä¶take the Intel lesson as a guide.  Edit: Took me forever to find it, but here‚Äôs essentially the specific Intel lesson I was referring to.  Direct quote from then CEO Andy Grove, ‚ÄúPeople who have no emotional stake in a decision can see what needs to be done sooner.‚Äù  This is back when he was able, with help, to convince the executives at Intel that it was time to move on from memories and into microprocessing.  Quote from this online article,   https://fs.blog/andy-grove-value-facing-reality/   ‚Ä¶‚ÄùGrove mentions regarding Intel, you must train yourself to see your situation from the perspective of an outsider.‚Äù  I know it‚Äôs business, but feel it‚Äôs also helpful when confronting life‚Äôs problems.  Lots of excellent advice. I.E Solve problems when they‚Äôre small etc.

zorqpk,j0sc2jz,,Call 2-1-1 and find a shelter. They should have workers to help guide you in your town.
zorqpk,j0otbcx,,Findhelp.org is not a bad place to start for resources in your area. Maybe transportation to work. Maybe a shelter near your job. I'd say to get on food stamps and the free phone via lifeline and if you also apply for the affordable connectivity program you'll get unlimited data on the phones.

zolyz3,j0nslji,,For me it wasn't by choice, I was living with my mom, brother, and sister after we had finally gotten an apartment in Atlanta. Soon after though, my brother was gone, then my sister, leaving me and mom to afford the place, it didn't take long for me to end up on the street.  After a while I got used to the lifestyle and was introduced to backpacking. I worked my job and collected enough overtime until I got fired, bought as much camping gear as I'd need, and now I'm in the process of walking from Atlanta to Vermont. It's not easy, it's not fun, but it's all worth it, trading security for freedom.

Closest I came was about a 136ish mile bicycle ride into another state when I was younger‚Ä¶it was an adventure for sure and I  never regretted it. Loads of planning and training required though, decisions‚Ä¶packing and repacking.  I bet you‚Äôve had lots of people try and talk you out of it too eh? Lol.  Stay safe and definitely do it while you can.
zolyz3,,j0tzxbu,Yeah, tons of family say it's a bad idea or that I should put more thought into it. But I'm fully intent on going through with it, and I've prepared for almost every situation besides a hurricane.  Vermont holds a special place in my heart, it's a place where I had visited often growing up and have some family there which I hold closely. Plus, my grandmother is buried there. I hope to be able to see her once more, but I doubt I'd be able to living any other lifestyle.
zolyz3,,j0voy8h,There‚Äôs definitely a learning curve to doing these kinds of things and it helps to do plenty of research and planning.   Even then, one can only plan so much. There‚Äôs definitely a time, place and how to get started‚Ä¶sounds like you‚Äôve already been conditioning yourself-done any hikes with more experienced hiker?.  That should help as well.  Nice to hear the sweet reasons behind wanting to head to Vermont.
zolyz3,,j0o61dc,Have you thought of backpacking the Pacific Crest Trail (Canada to Mexico thru WA, OR and CA) next Spring?  You have about a five month window weather wise to complete the trail.  It would be an awesome experience and you would be around people who share your love of freedom.
zolyz3,,j0ohity,I plan on doing the PCT. Going to stay in Washington after I'm done too
zolyz3,,j0u01qb,I hadn't considered many major trails, I figure now it may be a good idea to find similarly minded people in this though.
zolyz3,,j0oao0x,Why Vermont? I grew up in New Hampshire and Vermont is an amazing place if you can live in mountains off grid
zolyz3,,j0u04xv,I have many personal bonds with the area, including an appreciation for the wildlife and nature of the mountains.
zolyz3,,j0oi8s2,I spend about %25 to of my homeless time traveling; walking, hitchiking, and camping, through all sorts of places, and sometimes with very suspicious people. My record or most extreme is walking over 200 miles and hitchhiking 600 miles with the many usual unusuals who would only ever pick up a traveler, all in 4 days in one single speed travel, all with no money and just a few bottle of waters. Came close to dying many times. But haven't done anything that extreme in years. But on a smaller scale that's what I do when im homeless. I love being free, out there, taking chances, meeting people and all the unusual things, with all the dangers and struggles not mentioned, it makes me happy and experience a different world from the dreadful 9 to 5 life many have come to accept.  I am working on being able to travel more efficiently in a comfortable and awesome bus that I will live out of, convert it to run on electric, and do many more awesome things.
zolyz3,j0nv9xi,,It's been a slow downward spiral for me. I don't plan on staying homeless for long.
zolyz3,j0nyvya,,I live out of my car by choice. Nobody cared about me when I lived by myself in an apartment. Nobody visited me but the second I told my family I decided to live out of my car then all at once they cared about my safety. My rent went up $70 more per month. I was like why am I doing this? I was never hardly home anyway. I don't believe someone should stress over money. I'm not going to live and die that way. I thought too about not working a fixed schedule but for now I've worked the same place for over 5 years. It doesn't pay much but I do get about 4 weeks of vacation every year. During the holidays I travel because I don't like being forced to be around my family. It's not that I hate them but I'm a free spirit too and a deep thinker of life. My lifestyle works for me. Sometimes it really makes me happy and other times I wonder why meüòÇ but then I remember being broke all of the time. I guess you can say I'm on the path less driven. Survivor for sure.
zolyz3,,j0on4ib,You sound happy with where you are at for now living out of a car saving money from rent and all that, and that's great. I myself am working on living in a nice big travel bus probably with a pool on it and other ridiculous stuff. But i want to also have properties I that I can go to and do other specialize work there as I am a workaholic. Getting there is fun, but being there will be even better. And then I will do something else like see if I can live on mars for a while or something.
zolyz3,j0ojabp,,1st time. Irresponsibility and instability caused by cocaine (haven't touched it in 4 years) . 2nd time. Piece of shit roommate who preyed on the homeless got everyone evicted by pocketing the rent money then went around blaming me cause he knew my reputation was fucked from the first time. 3rd time, my house burned down. 4th time, my roommate didn't believe me that I couldn't find my own apartment within my financial means, found another roommate before I found a place, etc. Ive had the same roommate at two different houses now, starting second year living together. Dudes cool. Hope this situation works out.
zolyz3,,j0oxpsg,Damn you had a house in between all of that. Anyways hope things stay good or get better.
zolyz3,,j0oyjvv,I was renting the house spot with 4 other dudes  I am incredibly grateful for my friends who let me couch surf and am fucking terrified of what could go wrong because i no longer live in my hometown  But like i just want other people here to know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel when this shit happens  Forgot the covid eviction (rushed into a slum apartment after the fire, landlord blamed property neglect on me and roommate, roommate wouldn't go to the eviction hearing cause fucking i do not know
zolyz3,j0s7qkq,,I moved out of my parents house because they‚Äôre abusive and narcissistic. Didn‚Äôt even have a place to rent, I just had a vehicle. I chose living in my vehicle over being in their house and subject to their abuse. I‚Äôd make the same choice again.
zolyz3,,j0thxq1,I support you %100 in that. Its better than staying with really bad parents. And if you had a comfortable car setup, it might have been kind of fun.
zolyz3,j0nwhk2,,I was homeless by choice for about half a year. I had become fed up of the pointless 9 to 5 grind and decided to throw it all away and hit the road. In a way it was the best and also worst decision of my life. I roamed around a few states and met a lot of interesting people, but most of my time was spent just trying to find a place to eat, sleep, and sh*t. Being homeless is liberating in many ways, but 4 walls of your own and a private bathroom really can't be beat in my opinion. Although I'm a man of relatively few needs, I do prefer to have some small creature comforts.   I also didn't want to live a life in a way that exploited others, aka working for corporations that exploit or the government, I still don't. However, as I was begging for a living or using public resources such as homeless shelters and food banks, I felt that I was still exploiting the kindness of others, and even worse I was potentially taking food and space from others who really needed it. I realized you gotta pick your battles in life and compromise on a lot, but inherently you are only as happy in life with your situation as you wanna be.  In the end I decided to live in the middle path, I will not pursue meaningless hollow wealth, but I will live moderately comfortably by putting in the work at a modest job. I'm not happy about the fact that working for corporate interests inevitably harms others, but I will try to offset that by helping those in need in my community in whatever small way I can. That is pretty much it. The only advice I can give anyone reading this is to stop chasing the unrealistic ideal and try to become content with what you have and what you can do, even if it isn't what you think you want. Stop trying so hard to exist, stop overthinking things, let go and just let yourself be.   "The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves." -Alan Watts
zolyz3,,j0oh8og,Alan Watts is the only philosopher I ever really got interested in. Good quote. My being homeless situation is pretty much the same as yours btw
zolyz3,j0ojzec,,Video games caused me to be homeless, it was an addiction. Calling off work to play more, micro transactions every time my paycheck hit. Virtual life was greater than irl and I don‚Äôt have my Xbox anymore and I‚Äôm left laughing at all the memories I had.
zolyz3,,j0ozaak,Good thing it was just game addiction versus something like drug addiction. (Clarifying the point that recovering from homelessness because of game addiction is a bit easier than from something like drug or gambling addition.)
zolyz3,,j0snyu2,Addiction is addiction is addiction. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you‚Äôre bound to, addiction always degrades your life.
zolyz3,,j0sx5zi,Its extremely hard to recover when you have an addiction like drugs or gambling. Game addiction is much easier to recover. Thats what the point of the post. Iv never met a homeless person whose problem was game addiction because they likely recover quickly.
zolyz3,,j0uro8w,If you could pull your head out of your own arrogance you‚Äôll realize my point. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your addicted to. The beast is still there. Even if you quit one thing, say excessive gaming, the void is still there and you‚Äôll be susceptible to pick up an alternative. Recovery isn‚Äôt abstinence either, it‚Äôs changing your thought process and your mindset. Have some compassion, would you?
zolyz3,,j0wf6os,You're trying to say '2 apples are apples' as if you are somehow right about being wrong that while they are both apples one is fresh and one is rotten. You are incapable of telling such difference. I wont be surprised at all if you can't tell the difference at all from poo and from beans. You're in the wrong and nothing else you say matters, including the twisted compassion statement you used - when it comes to what addiction is harder to get out of when you are homeless or what caused you to be homeless. Drug addiction is one of the hardest addiction there is, that's why the majority of long term homeless are on drugs or become homeless because of drugs. But im not hating like most do. Im just disappointed and sadden for you and others that are stuck on what you're stuck on... For your sake ill reiterate for clarity. I know that apples are apples, and I understand that they both have other similar qualities, but I can also see that each apple is different from one another; one is fresh and good for the body and one is rotten and only really good for the soil.
zolyz3,,j1wiv1v,Pretty sure being physically addicted to heroin is worse for you and much harder to get out of being psychologically addicted to a videogame
zolyz3,j0ntqip,,Peel back the onions
zolyz3,j0odnnk,,I got hit by a nasty combination of multiple intersecting disabilities, being stuck in a dead-end job before those disabilities hit, that job dragging its feet for months on a severance package, divorce, social isolation, the fallout from covid, living in a conservative rural area with no resources, being stuck for a while in a state without the Medicaid expansion, and a lot of bad luck trying to navigate the resources that exist while some of the aforementioned disabilities make that navigation even more difficult than it is for the average person.
zolyz3,,j0ow05u,Are you out of the homeless situation. Iv never had any real disability I guess so I can only imagine how much harder it makes things.
zolyz3,,j0p1xon,I'm experiencing a temporary reprieve from my homeless situation. I made a tiktok about my situation, and about the homeless situation in Denver in general, trying to raise awareness and spur people to action because things are getting really bad here, and they were getting particularly bad for me. The videos went viral, one of them getting over a million views. People found my PayPal and lit it up to the tune of about $7,000. I'm currently in a pay by the week hotel room, trying to figure out how to leverage that money into a more stable situation before it runs out repeatedly paying for the hotel room.
zolyz3,,j0st2br,Wow thats awesome. I hope you make the best of it. I wish you the best. Also politicians are always using federal money for the homeless for other things and it's always been that way. But that's another issue. Good luck. Oh do you have the link to the tiktok video by chance?
zolyz3,,j0tj7y7,Sure. I made several. The three main ones on the homeless situation and my story are [here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRq1YwdS/), [here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRq1hbS6/), and [here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRq1AKbo/).
zolyz3,,j0wcej5,Just followed you over on tik tok. I am so happy so many people are helping you and you in turn helping others. See what one person can do? You are amazing and so well spoken. I would want you on my side any day of the week. Your pup is so cute and I am so happy you both have a warm place to go. There is an organization in Nevada that helps homeless people and their pets all over U.S. and parts of Canada. If you go on their website and put in zip or city you can find places to get free pet food. There are also lots of resources on the site. You can also get a free crate and free vet care but for that you need to call. The phone number is 775-841-7463    https://www.petsofthehomeless.org/  Thank you for all you are doing for homeless people. üíú
zolyz3,,j0y9odj,Thank you! I will peruse the site.
zolyz3,,j0tmqio,Thank you. Ill let my slow internet load them. But a few days ago i saw a homeless died from cold in the morning. My intuition says that the police probably took away their tent and property, and then they froze to death very soon after. Its very likely as it is common for the police and such to take away homeless property. I wish i knew the true story but im likely right about it. They had a wheelchair and nothing else.
zolyz3,,j0r303j,Have you considered relocating to somewhere w more affordable housing compared to Denver?
zolyz3,,j0r51vq,I wouldn't know where that would be, where I could also get the other resources I need to survive. I've already relocated once to Denver. I'm also pretty pissed about what Denver is doing, and I kind of want to make a stand and fight of it, for the sake of the other homeless people out there.
zolyz3,,j0rc5w8,Compared to Denver a lot of the Midwest is pretty inexpensive. What is denver doing that you‚Äôre talking about?
zolyz3,,j0rfoi6,I came from the Midwest. Bare cost of living is not my only concern. Most of the country is losing its mind, and the Midwest is jumping off the deep end with reactionary bullshit. I'm lgbtq+, disabled, and not going to do well in a reactionary wasteland.  They're doing the ramped up sweeps. I couldn't even find a place to sleep several nights, and I was a mess from it.
zolyz3,,j0rwtel,That sounds really tough. Are the shelters here not an option for you?
zolyz3,,j0s0oho,Every one I've called has either been full, or they won't take my dog, or some other bullshit technicality. Also, I'm autistic and have sensory processing issues, and being packed into a crowded noisy shelter could result in a shutdown on meltdown.
zolyz3,,j0voovi,What solution would you like Denver to provide in your case?
zolyz3,j0pqsjm,,Mental illness, alcohol & drug abuse, untreated personality disorder(s), extreme stress, crappy childhood, crappy parents and a decent amount of bad luck.
zolyz3,j0r1ms8,,I was in a domestic abuse situation and needed the space to heal.
zolyz3,j0r1wtu,,Fraudulent eviction, family is abusive and I have no friends. I need to make 3x full time minimum wage just to get a place, on top of having good credit, a consistent job for at least a year or two, and consistent rental history and references. I have Autism that I can't pass interviews and several neurodivergences that I can't pass hiring questionaires. I have never been able to obtain full time work, just the lowest of the low jobs where the jobs were so shitty they hired anyone with hiring documents or I got to skip the interview due to some freak circumstances.  Even if I had a voucher, vouchers only cover what rent used to be almost a decade ago. I would need a full time job AND a voucher. Disability and Social Security aren't good enough or enough even with a voucher, and I have been discriminated against by landlords for being disabled and not having full time work like a fully abled person.  My ex has a voucher and he works full time at a UNIONIZED JOB. Landlords won't even take him BECAUSE he has a voucher. Which is crazy because it means he wouldn't be rent burdened and even if there was another economic downturn, they would still be getting their rent every month at least to the amount of the voucher. All these landlords who ended up selling their properties wouldn't have had to had they willingly accepted vouchers or actively rented to voucher holders. They would have been ok through the pandemic...
zolyz3,,j0t4ydz,I see you are somewhat stuck with partial disability where its just enough to help you get some support but also screws you over in many other things. That's a tough spot to get out of. But hopefully, with time good things will come around. I myself am getting into a better situation bit by bit. Im not homeless at the moment though so that helps.
zolyz3,,j0t7j0c,I don't know what you mean by "partial disability", I AM disabled and I can't get SSDI because I don't have enough work credits because you have to "become disabled" after being fully abled. I have 3 developmental disorders which are for life (Autism, ADHD, and childhood PTSD. I also have complex PTSD which also includes stuff from childhood.). I'm not even old enough to have enough work credits even if I was fully abled and managed to spend my entire adult life working full time continuously.  My most recent psych evaluation even downgraded me to high functioning Autism to "requires substantial support". Crazy enough I have been getting assistance with supportive services for independent living under the table by asking people for help because the pandemic has made it impossible for me to do basic things, but help hasn't been consistent.  I really need actual services but even the Autism place in my area turned me away. I am now trying to go through 4 different organizations in hope of getting supportive services. I have been asking for any kind of mental health assistance since 2019 when I finally aged off the insurance of my biological parents who were keeping my medical insurance card from me and were saying no to almost any kind of mental or physical medical care I asked for permission to use the insurance.
zolyz3,,j0t9hv0,What is your disability of you don't mind telling. I thought that maybe your autism was counted as a disability where you can get some social security support from. I know that autism makes it really hard for people to get by in life. But I guess your disability is something else. But no worries just curious.
zolyz3,,j0tcoh1,I don't get any help for Autism but I am trying to. I also have ADHD which is developmental and is for life but I keep getting refused an updated diagnosis by psychiatrists for being drug adverse. I also have childhood PTSD and complex PTSD, but good luck finding someone to evaluate for them. Even the place which gets federal funding FOR helping people with developmental disabilities refused to evaluate or help with childhood PTSD or ADHD, and they have NOTHING for Autistic adults.  I would have qualified for disability before I started working (Otherwise you need to become disabled after having 15 years of "work credits" where you worked enough hours to get credit. You don't become Autistic, you are born that way.), but my sister was being coached on how to have control over my money so she could use it for whatever I wanted. I was being abused all sorts of was by my biological family and treated like I was an object or a cat (Not allowed to have my documents, only allowed to go somewhere if approved and with an escort, everything needed permission, not allowed to even step outside for a walk.), so the only thing I could do was beg the evaluator to let me work and I had some hiring paperwork in my hands for sign spinning because they had be skip the interview expecting me to fail, but everything past the interview was task based and then they didn't want to get sued.  The fact that I worked at all disqualified me. Had I never worked a day in my life, I would be set once my biological father retires because I would qualify for the Adult Disabled Child Benefit which is based on what he paid into social security and he earned a quarter of a million a year as a fill in ER doctor. Autism and ADHD is genetic, so any disabled progeny and their progeny and so on would have been ok, but nope... My sister literally tried to take my rights away out of greed and she had already been mishandling the money she was given for me and refusing to take me to the supermarket more than 30 minutes once a month that I literally wound up bedridden because of her from severe undereating when I already have reactive hypoglycemia.  I do have other issues like being legally blind without glasses and not having glasses. I have reactive hypoglycemia which is killing me and probably behind my vision loss. I have chronic pain from my head to my knees which gets worse the more I walk and it hurts to sit with my knees bent at a 90 degree angle (such as sitting in a chair) or more than 30 minutes though I keep finding myself in pain way before that (I can't even finish self tying a futomomo without being in pain!), and even standing still without moving my legs is unbearably painful (Movement distracts from the pain, yet the more I move, the more pain I am in.  I wouldn't be surprised if I find myself using a wheelchair someday not because I can't walk, but to reduce the pain I will feel later or because of the pain I am in. But for now I have no choice but to walk through the pain, which is terrifying because my right hip and knee go crazy whenever I walk anywhere.). Back in 2014 I was told I had improper body mechanics, muscle weakness (Funny because I always crawled up stairwells until the bullying to so bad I had to stop. I still climb stairs toe to heel because it distracts from and lessens the pain to walk that way. I was told this is a muscle weakness and a muscle imbalance thing.), muscle tightness, and muscle imbalance. I also have 1 leg which is shorter than the other and the hop on that side is more forward. I do not have corrective shoes or insoles or anything. So I am just constantly walking unaligned. Basically, everything hurts.  I don't think any of my other issues could be considered to be disabling, just annoying and uncomfortable.  Oh, I have absence siezures, reactive hypoglycemia, and sometimes I suddenly get really dizzy or can't walk in a straight line! The dizziness and difficulty walking straight are triggered by my low blood sugar. Low blood sugar triggers low blood pressure which triggers siezures and also dizziness. Whereas other people have to worry about blood pressure, I find that eating salty or high electrolyte foods make me less dizzy and function better even though eating salt is horrible for you. I was reading an article the other day I wish I could find and share...
zolyz3,,j0tenyo,Thank you for sharing all of that. I think you posted another post about your sister causing physical damage to you through a fall but i wont detail it as i am sure it should be private. Well I have a bit of so called high functioning autism, ADHD, and PTSD myself so I understand you quite well in that regards. Including trying to get help for it and how it effects everything else in your life. But with all the other problems you have and with the family i really feel your situation. I have some minor chronic pain and issues but no where near like what you mentioned. I do wish things start to get better for you. Thank you for sharing.  And if you ever want to talk I am a good listener and learner and am patient so as long as you don't go ballistic bat shit crazy out of the blue lol, like most people do especially online, then i am here.
zolyz3,,j0uz8qa,Thanks. But I talk alot. I deleted another comment I made last night after posting it. I have a really hard time not going on a rant and repeating my life story. The pain isn't that bad, I guess I am used to it. It is just that it is always there in a way. There isn't a day where I don't feel some discomfort. I find being on my phone or doing something which takes all of my attention distracts from it, not being on the phone or working means I am more aware of it because my mind isn't elsewhere.
zolyz3,,j0wkjvn,No worries. I really am here though. And I really do care. It helps me and everyone else, when we learn from and help each other so I am all open. At the same time I don't want to cause you to talk about or dwell on any unnecessary negativity if its not going to be helpful. But I want you to know that if you got something to vent or express, im here.
zolyz3,j0wfuo5,,Domestic Violence made me and my kids and cat homeless. We left with nothing but a bag of clothes and a pillow we each grabbed while police were there. Had my cat at a friends till I figured out where we were going. We sat at the police station till they figured out what to do with us and then one of them drove us to the cheapest motel in my city. Was pretty gross but was still over 100 a night. We stayed 2 nights then took a taxi to what we thought was a shelter but instead were dropped off at a house. We were scared to death in a new city, in an apartment shared with another mom and her two kids. Each bedroom (2)  had 3 beds and we shared the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. We stayed there 4 years and went through 4 different families. We finally got on housing last year and now the kids and I are in a gorgeous 3 bedroom apartment in a 3 family home and we are back to our old city where all our friends are. First time the kids have had their own bedroom and my first time having my own in 35 years. I love sleeping alone with my cat in a huge bed. This was our first time being homeless and except for kids at the school kids went to we never knew anyone homeless but we have been helping people in boston for years on the street. When I asked my kids why they help they told me watching you when we were little. Made me so proud of them. I am also on disability from an old ex stabbing me when I dumped him so I guess you could say I became homeless over my bad choices in men. Its why I'm staying single the rest of my life,  already been 5 wonderful years.
zolyz3,,j11f3ei,Good to hear things are better for you and your kids and that they are good kids. My mom stuck with her kids after our dad left and she stayed single her whole life to take care of the kids (about 9 of us). Even after we grew up, she always kept to her kids - a bit toooooo much. Its kinda sad for her i assume, but at least she did what she thought/felt was right. Oh and i hope your ex is locked up for apparent attempted murder especially just for a breakup. But that's just me.
zolyz3,j0q00er,,Why dont you work for a non profit?? And do volunteer work? That way you can still earn a legit living. What happens when you can no longer work and you have paid no taxes? Do you think you are going to draw some diability or retirement? What then?
zolyz3,,j0qsn96,I've wondered about that, too. I don't know if those people think that far ahead. They don't realize that when they can't work or when they get hurt, they're going to be dependent on the very government they think is the root of all evil. And what REALLY pisses me off is that the money for their food stamps and healthcare will come from the formerly homeless--people who had hard times but worked their rears off to make their lives better.
zolyz3,,j0rv5x4,really good point...who do they think pays for thre food stamps and govt benefits so many think they are entitled too?
zolyz3,,j0sz4kt,Do either of you care that the majority of people who have food stamps and other support systems have homes. While most homeless people do not have any of it including food stamps because they cant even help themselves get or keep food stamps. Most homeless people get by without the support system you elude to.
zolyz3,j0p598n,,Saying you are homeless because you can‚Äôt function within the confines of normal society supports the homeless people are crazy idea btw.
zolyz3,j0okppt,,I'm going to try to make this as short as possible because the full detailed version would end up being way too long.       Lost my job May of 2021 after working there for  nearly a decade, Had recently moved back in with my mom who is disabled part of her disability being mental illness which was in decline. She's on SSDI and has a HCV/section 8. There's a discrepancy about a rental increase that Landlord requested starting June 1st. Which would increase the portion of rent that my mom was responsible for. This conflicts with  what my mom had previously been told by the housing authority. She attempts to confirm with her case worker at the housing authority and lets the landlord know that her **portion** of the rent would have to be confirmed before she could pay. The Landlord would and did receive the majority of the rent that was subsidized  on the 1st of every month.  My car gets repossessed in June, but I do manage to get another job. It's for less money but works for me and is easy to get to by bus. We don't hear anything from the case worker until early July. The call does not go well. Case worker is reported. There's a whole back and forth with the case worker regarding paperwork etc... case worker gets everything she needs in order to calculate the corrected rent amount by the end of July.  In the meantime my mom has been keeping the Landlord updated. But with her behavior becoming more erratic the conversations done always go well and she ends up pissing them off.  I'm trying to take over things now.  August comes and the case worker still hasn't given us the amount.  I reach out to her. In the meantime we receive notice of eviction for non payment of rent. A court date is scheduled. BUT, the federal eviction moratorium that was suppose to end on July 29th 2021 gets extended until October 3rd and prevents Landlords from evicting tenants for non payment of rent only.  So Landlord & Lawyer re file this time accusing my mom of "extreme uncleanliness" and being  a "nuisance" which is BS.  A new court date is set.  An eviction for someone on section 8 can automatically result in them losing their voucher, their subsidy.  I start researching and contacting the housing authority etc.. in the midst of all of it and dealing with my mom who cant handle any of this. I get the dates of the hearing mixed up and end up missing it.  Which is an automatic win for the Landlord and we then receive a 10 day notice to vacate.  I reach out to a local legal aid non profit that provides legal services to the poor/low income for help.  I finally receive a response from the case worker who is aware of the eviction and is happy to tell me that eviction results in voucher loss oh and that she has that corrected rent amount for us finally.  I submit some reasonable accommodation requests to try and save my mom's voucher.  I let the case worker know  I contacted legal aid that's when she sends me the info for the emergency rental assistance program.  I get in touch with Legal Aid and she explains our options and works to push through our rental assistance application.  The offer to the Landlord is that if she drops the eviction that she will receive the total past due rent amount and the next three months rent in advance.  Landlord agrees but wants to add that we will agree to move by April 1st, 2022 and also we have to personally pay the $500 legal fees.  We accept. She gets paid. Eviction gets dropped. Crises adverted...           We are paid up until January 1st 2022.  I start casually looking for apartments for rent in December. I reach out to the housing authority at the beginning of the year and ask if they offer any assistance for tenants searching for section 8 apartments. They send me a list that is  a half page long with listings from 2021 and 2020 that of course, are no longer available.    The state of Pennsylvania where we live has no source of income law. Source of income laws prevent Landlords from denying rentals to people who are on section 8.  So with the exception of Philadelphia and I believe Pittsburgh who enacted their own source of income laws locally. The rest of the counties in the state have not. Which means refusing to rent to people on section 8,  is a perfectly legal form of discrimination and people are happy to do so.  I started documenting my rental search in February which I did daily. Everything was paid, everyone was getting along so we ask the Landlord if she could  possibly reconsider the move  out date extending it.  She declined.  I reach out to the case worker ( New case worker) at the housing authority and submit  a reasonable accommodation request for an extended voucher extension.  You see when you have a housing voucher once you move out of a property you are given only a certain amount of time to find a new place to live. I think it's about 60 days normally, if you can't find somewhere to live within that time frame you lose your voucher. But you can automatically get a month extension, possible more if you're disabled though reasonable accommodation.  I also sent her a detailed email explaining the issues were having finding somewhere to live and pleading for help.  Only to get a one line response offering no help.  I was contacting rentals every day. I reached out to realtors who have worked with section 8 properties. Nothing.  April 1st comes and we don't know what to expect  we have no where to go.  We end up telling the Landlord and she agrees to another month.    But two weeks later we receive eviction notice,  My mom ends up falling and breaking bones having to go to the hospital. This happens of course the day we're suppose to be in court.  So we miss it, she gets her judgement.  I email the lawyer from legal aid who helped us before asking her what to do. She tells me that I can file an appeal but that she technically can't help because our case had been closed out and we would have to re apply to open it again.  I didn't have time for that so with just a couple days before the Landlord can legally file the 10 day order to vacate. I have to get to the county court house and file an appeal. I manage to do it in time and get a hearing date for January 2023 and as long as I keep paying rent to the court we can stay in the apartment. So more time right....     No. So despite me making multiple trips to the court house throughout the month of May to make payments. The clerk that filed my paperwork did not explain something about certian sums of money having to be paid by specific dates correctly and me, someone with no legal experience at all thinking I'm within the dates required to make payments I end up missing a deadline which left me open to the Landlord being able to file to vacate my supersedeas which is what was allowing us to remain on the property until the appeal date. I didn't realize it but the landlord's lawyer sure did and they went right in and filed to vacate it, once it was we received a ten day order to vacate and on June 9th 2022. The police and landlord came to our apartment where my mother lived for 13 years and gave us 20 minutes to grab whatever we could carry and leave the premises. So me, my mother who is completely out of her mind at this point and our 14 year old elderly Dog got evicted and were left sitting out front locked out  of our apartment.  As of that day we were homeless.   It continues to get worse and this lasted until October.  But this is already way too long so I'll end it here.
zolyz3,,j0oqphy,Thank you for posting that. Sounds like you got out of that whole situation around Oct. Its always tougher when you are homeless not by choice. Your situation is that saying, 'most people are one paycheck away from being homeless', excluding your moms separate situation. Hope things are better now.
zolyz3,j0o797q,,Someone didn't like I made noise in the apartment that I paid for and threatened to off me in my sleep. He gave me night terrors where I would scream bloody murder I'm assuming he talked to me through the wall and said worse.
zolyz3,,j0oonq6,Well hopefully you are just temporarily homeless or you already got off the streets and got into a better situation now. Homeless can be tough or horrible for most people. But for me, I've always chosen to be homeless, on and off. Also I live homeless different from most other people. I usually move around a lot or travel far distances, I usually have money, a bike (bike never goes flat), etc. Its an adventure for me. I am usually clean so most time I don't look homeless. So being homeless is not as bad for me. My only complaint is not having a restroom available 24/7.
zolyz3,,j0pyh2m,I have a job and roof for now but I was in and out of hotels and charities for a while. I'm done staying in one place for less than a month tbh.
zolyz3,j0qyd4u,,I used to believe you could make money and maintain good morals. I used to believe that you didn't need money to live. I used to believe women made life better. I used to believe that life gets better. Unhealthy expectations lead to an unhealthy life.
zolyz3,,j0szrki,You have the wrong idea about those things. All of that is true if you do it right in your life. There will be ups and downs and you will have to be able to adapt to them to stay on top of them. Life does get better, but life also gets worst sometimes. Adapting to it as it moves, rather than expecting it to stay the same, is how you stay on top of it and not drown in it.
zolyz3,,j0xyjor,You can't make anyone love you.
zolyz3,j0sqi8p,,Just found out today that childhood trauma causes permanent changes in the brain... I have been abandoned and neglected my entire life because I have mom-induced ptsd, that everyone was going to make sure I dealt with alone, or chose to believe I was a liar.
zolyz3,,j0tktw3,Anything that affects you can cause permanent change. But especially at a young age, the brain is super sensitive and adaptable and will rewire itself however so needed for survival against trauma, etc. But adults on the other hand, are more dead, so nothing can really change their mind or beliefs, so they are safer in that sense from being traumatized. I assume you have mommy issues? Which I am not making fun of but curious as you said mom induced ptsd.  I forgot to add. No matter how bad your ptsd is, it can always be fixed. Its like associating a name with being bad, like the name Brad, because there was once a very horrible person name Brad. So everytime you come across a person name Brad it triggers all sorts of horrible thoughts. But with time, you can fix that problem and see that not all Brads are bad. That's a simple way of putting it. But most ptsd can be fixed.
zolyz3,j0t27k8,,I‚Äôm mentally ill I‚Äôm not normal maybe I can work few hours here and there but can‚Äôt for extended period because I have mental and physical disability üò≠
zolyz3,,j0t8jjb,Similar here, mostly in the 'mentally ill' / disabled sense. My max work time was 1 year i think. I was ready to jump off a truck after doing the same thing over and over, so I quit. But at least i never got fired in any of my jobs ever. I always quit with people begging me to stay. I am somewhat surprise that with my nearly empty work history and all my quit status on all my jobs, I don't have as hard a time getting a job as many people claim to be have. But yeah I cant work a 9 to 5 due to many reasons. Just a rant i guess...
zolyz3,j1ns5yk,,My wife of 14 years left me suddenly and i kinda snapped and i just never really recovered. I try to keep an outward appearance of a functioning member of society hell its been almost 2 years and some of my people still dont really know that i just basically gave up. But to be honest ive wanted to drop out of society for awhile now. Im totally where i am by choice at this point.
zokzx0,j0oud0v,,5 pm to 5 am, those are amateur drinking hours...  I get it, but seriously why do people think no one is drunk during the day.  I'm a recovering alcoholic and I was plastered in the middle of the day plenty.  I don't drink anymore, but I work nights and the non alcoholic people that drink are drinking after work at 6 am, that's their equivalent of 6pm.
zokzx0,,j0xui0b,You raise some very good points!
zokzx0,j0xocbr,,Thank you
zokzx0,,j0xucwi,You are welcome and I am glad it worked! I
zok8ls,j0ninjv,,Glad you‚Äôre doing much better now OP!  My family has been an odd one for sure.  Loads of mental health issues. My mother and father both had Ed.   As a child I‚Äôd catch my dad purposely gagging himself‚Ä¶not all the time, never recall asking him why nor ever speaking with him about it.  My mother and her side of the family openly shamed anyone not skinny, yet when it came to her children (three boys) I do not recall any direct shaming. Though I am leaving some details out for brevity.  My question is this: Do you have any other siblings and or family members and if so how might you compare/contrast how your parents treated them differently?  PS‚Ä¶the dentist bit hit a bit close to home with me. I wasn‚Äôt left on purpose or anything, but my narcissistic mother could not let go of constantly reminding me of a single medical bill she was paying on my behalf that occurred before I turned 18 due to playing ball with friends after work.  At that time, I had not had any insurance for over three years and the bill originally was about $3500.
zok8ls,,j0s8wtu,Yes I have two sisters. I am a middle child and the younger sibling is my half sister. I am the only sibling that was homeless, and the only one that hustles and wants/believes in creating a career for herself. I was sort of the forgotten sibling though which made me more prone to escaping in my addiction. My younger sis is the baby and def isn‚Äôt as criticized and therefor she‚Äôs kinda lazy. I‚Äôm very go go go and make money.
zok8ls,,j0scolc,Thank you for the reply OP‚Ä¶admittedly, family dynamics is a one of my go to areas.  I suppose because it just stacks up so differently at times when comparing, but also shares commonalities here and there.  I‚Äôm the youngest and was the go getter of my family (not so much due to health issues now).   My oldest brother was treated much differently, golden child out of the three of us.  It stinks being the forgotten one, yet certainly makes one realize that you‚Äôve only got yourself to rely on.  Unfortunately, I never quite got out and away from my dysfunctional family.  Wish I had‚Ä¶a thousand times over‚Ä¶it‚Äôs costs me time and time again dearly in all ways.  Thanks again OP for sharing.
zok8ls,j0nuhjo,,I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing better! Life *is* worth living, no matter how hard things get, and you *are* important and worth taking care of. Be good to yourself. I was 6‚Äô2 and 132lbs at my worst. I moved out of my shitty home environment and holy shit did I flourish and turn right around.   My questions are: What was shelter living like? What did you do during the day? What was your worst experience being homeless? What was your best?
zok8ls,,j18yzgs,Hi! Sorry for the delayed response. The first shelter in Manhattan felt like a college dorm, the floors were separated by gender, there was a designated breakfast and dinner room. I had much shame living there. They had a metal detector to enter it, an area to claim donated clothes, paths to finish high school (since it was a youth shelter), my sheets were tattered and ripped I remember, each room had two bunk beds so four girls to a room. The second two shelters were in the Bronx and were much smaller, about 20 girls in each. It was more of a house and I had one roommate in each. There was a curfew, it was a little cleaner, but one had mice that ran across my bed at night. They sometimes had people come and talk to us about STD eduction or their experience getting out of homelessness. The other girls were a mix of pot heads, super depressed, couple thieves, somewhat motivated, and then somewhat normal. They all had a curfew too which was like 9 on weekdays and 11 on weekends I believe. Every other week you met with an assigned counselor who you‚Äôd connect and update with on your work situation and future plans.
zok8ls,j0o992c,,I have never seen an AMA here.
zok8ls,j0nsghz,,Did your views on the homeless and lower class change after becoming homeless?   I ask because mine did. I was taught to avoid homeless people on the street when walking by them, that they were dirty and dangerous. I also didn‚Äôt realize how easy it was to become homeless and how close so many people are, that ANYONE could be on the street
zok8ls,,j18zpok,Absolutely. At that time I had never experienced having no one or nowhere to go. I felt like a piece of trash, completely worthless and less than the rest of humanity. But I know what it takes to get out of that mindset and move on as well. It‚Äôs not impossible and everyone‚Äôs situation is different, but a lot of people tend to get comfortable living in shelters and just never bother trying to become financially stable. It‚Äôs a mixture of mental illness and not having family that plagues most homeless people. So while I feel for them when I see them on the street sometimes still, I know there‚Äôs really nothing I can do to change their situation the majority of the time. It‚Äôs a form of escapism in my opinion also, and it took trauma for them to get there and it‚Äôll take a lot to make them leave that life behind. That‚Äôs what it was for me, escapism as a last resort from my terrible home and personal lives.
zok8ls,j0pczpv,,how'd you get over the bulimia?
zok8ls,j0o2axj,,I am glad you are better.  Please seek out social supports you are eligible for such as medicaid, snap benefits and possibly housing.  Take care.
zok8ls,j0nl3yh,,How did you get access to shelters if you‚Äôre from North Jersey?
zok8ls,,j1904u6,I took the bus to Secaucus train station then to port authority. My mom had dropped me off at the dentist to pay a bill, had turned off and taken away my phone, and when I walked back out she had driven away. I already had a backpack of essentials on me but thought she was going to drop me off at my grandparents, but later I learned she‚Äôd expected me to walk the five miles or so home (it was winter and 30 degrees out) instead. So I saw my chance and hopped like two different busses to the train station then from there went to port authority in Manhattan.
zok8ls,j0nkhsf,,Did you eat off the land?
zok8ls,,j0psi8o,Why the down votes-seems reasonable given the nature of the situation and this is an AMA is it not?  Surely eating off the land is a fair topic for discussion to me.
zok8ls,,j0vi9io,Could be because the OP mentions an eating disorder. If she hasn't fully recovered, talking about food might be a trigger. (Yes, I know she said AMA.)
zok8ls,,j0vromm,I could see this and perhaps a couple of knee jerk responses lead to downvotes.   Ty for sharing this perspective.  I deal with being food poor (from childhood) and though it‚Äôs been years still struggle.  My knee jerk reaction while in a convenience store observing an employee just tossing the older hotdogs in the trash‚Ä¶was me nearly scolding this person for just following guidelines of their job while digging the hotdogs out of the trash.  Bit of a whoa moment for me.   By comparison, if I had followed through with what flashed through my mind in an instant during that moment, a couple of downvotes would be a small hiccup in the face of another‚Ä¶to what would‚Äôve been a direct Vomiting in the face.  I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôve made some progress since then.
zok8ls,j0q0zw5,,I live in the suburbs of northern NJ. What can people like me (who don't know any homeless people personally) do to help people like you? Are there any good local organizations you'd recommend donating to? Is there anything else we can do?
zok8ls,j0qkv4h,,I have never been so insulted in my life until this group attacked me asking a simple question.
zok8ls,j0whaxr,,So sorry for all you have been through. Its horrible what your mom did to you and I'm so sorry about your dad. I too had/have an eating disorder but mine started at 20 when an ex told me I could lose a few pounds I weighed 130 and starved myself to 110 in 2 weeks. Have still never gotten it out of my system and I have ibs so eating to me causes pain. I could go 18 hours forgetting to eat. I am so happy you are doing better and hope your in your own place now. I am so proud of you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Lots of homeless people I‚Äôve talked to were from all different parts of the US and wound up in NYC.
zojsnf,,j0whpu5,Isnt Long Island in NY? Why wouldnt you be able to go to a NY shelter? Your from NY. I had people from Haiti, Florida and Georgia who all came to my state to get in a shelter. None of them were from my state so I don't see a problem. Good luck.

Also, plenty of free food at food banks and soup kitchens. I shower at the soup kitchen. Try to migrate to a place that has this holy trinity of life savers if possible.
zocf8h,,j0m6z6n,I was thinking just that. The next city is 2 hours walk so I'm pretty much gonna hit the road tomorrow and see my options. I also wanted to go to library but couldn't find one. I've had help at the food bank, salvation army gave me some nice green curry, but as a chef I could tell they made the most from what little they had and my heart breaks that there's so many of us struggling. I've met a Brazilian guy as well and it was nice to feel human.  Even for that 5 Minutes
zocf8h,j0mg0u7,,To the best of my knowledge, from what I've learned through this sub... in the UK, you need the approval of the Local Council Authority, to stay in a shelter, hostel, or get housing assistance.  Thus the "not a walk-in center" response.  They only house who the council tells them to house.  So... what has the council for the town you are in told you about your situation?  What about places not like Starbucks, but instead like independent coffee shops?  You could offer to sweep and take out their trash, in exchange for sitting quietly and charging your phone.  See a small cafe that looks mostly empty?  Ask there.  See if you can trade immediate work for the warmth and space.  Chances are you'll get sympathy, and a free hot drink, and you'll get told to sit and not worry about the sweeping.  You offer to work FIRST, and you ask for almost nothing.  If it goes to plan... you got what you originally intended.  If it doesn't, you try the place next door or across the street.
zocf8h,,j0mhude,Thank you! I absolutely resonate with what you suggested! It never occurred to me, but I'll definitely try! Thank you!   I've applied for Universal Credit, once I'm eligible I think I'll be able to. Get help but I have 2 years worth  gap in my last 5 yesrs staying in the UK so they were unable to help. Tomorrow I'll see someone from a charity who is kind enough to give me sleeping bag , clothes and warm meal.  I hopefully make it through! There's another place St. Mungo's, they told me to call them and they will probably pick me up if I tell them where I'm sleeping. People have been very helpful and I really appreciate it so much. All the help and kindness.
zocf8h,,j0mpnua,Small goals.  The trade of quick work for almost nothing... if done consistently, proves to a shop manager or owner that you are dependable, which is half-way to getting a job.  Maybe it isn't sweeping and trash... maybe it is dishes.  Maybe it is breaking down a mountain of cardboard boxes.  First goal... find a place that lets you make this kind of trade.  Second goal.. find a place that lets you do it again on another day.  At that point, you are practically a "regular".  Again... if nothing else, you've got a "dependable" place to get warm.... and a purpose, which would be being on time to make the right impression.
zocf8h,,j0nfu6u,Thank you! This is the kind of advice that reminds me of who I am. I used to be very helpful actually, but I resent the person I've become because of the shit I had to endure. I will see what I can do and what tomorrow brings. Thank you for your insights. I truly appreciate it
zocf8h,j0ndiek,,Don't know how it is over there but over here Starbucks can no longer say anything to anyone that just wants to come in use the bathroom and sit down without buying anything. I would give that a try, what about bus stations or airports?

Write down the things that need to be done and go about doing them without getting emotionally involved. Sock away whatever you can and get a side job so supplement your income.  Don‚Äôt overdo with work. No good to be exhausted physically and mentally which leads you down the road of where you don‚Äôt want to end up. You can‚Äôt control everything that happens to you, but you can lessen the punch.
zobgqu,j0mu8ff,,For the first year I was here in my apt it was very hard to accept that it was going to be my permanent home. I was very anxious and even after a year I was convinced that unless things were PERFECT when they came to inspect the place that likely they would take it away from me and I would end up back in the shelter.   I never missed a rent payment. I was pretty much a model tenant but I was still worried I'd be rejected for another Affordable Housing voucher and a new lease. I scrubbed this place for DAYS before the inspection. Nobody does that here. The caseworkers were like "Calm down. It will be fine!" but that's how scared I was about renewal and keeping this place.   What you're feeling is natural under the circumstances. It's valid but you have to take a deep breath and risk it anyway. Being in a home again it will be worth all the anxiety, I promise, and when you can finally close the door and lock it and lay in your bed in your very own space again you will grin at your own fears.   You can make it. Just take it slow and keep at it. It is possible if you do your best and that's all anyone can reasonably ask of you.   ü§óü§óü§ó

Expensive car payments...credit card spending. doing stupid things like taking out high interest title loans...dont do it. Live within your means and you will be alright.   Get renters insurance. It is cheap and worth it. If you have a puppy get pet insurance. Its cheap and vet bills can get expensive. Stay out of trouble....mind your p's and q's (My Dad sais that alot) and you will  be fine.   Lots of luck to you!

zobgqu,j0m66az,,Slow down  >My next biggest fear? Losing the house after we get it. Getting behind on bills. Getting evicted. The house has a 6mo lease.... So if I lose my job or get hurt or whatever, my understanding is that I have to pay the rent no matter what even if I move.  Your problems are one of money management.  I'm not saying that your problems WERE always money management.  I'm saying that what you are staring at now... is money management.  Assuming you had the house inspected by an independent home inspector, and you have a REAL idea of what issues you'll have to face going forward... regarding expected repairs and maintenance... keeping the house is largely a matter of restructuring how you live to a much more frugal model, to be able to build a cushion with the money instead for any emergencies that may arise.  For example... ANYWHERE that I live in the future, I will have solar panels set up.  I don't give a fuck if I have to put panels on an apartment building roof, and misuse a 10GA extension cord for the wiring down to a window (to avoid power loss really.. anything smaller would certainly heat up) so I can have batteries and a controller in my living room... I'm getting most of my power from solar.  Make the investment when you have the money, and the lack of an electric bill (or a credit from the electric company when you produce more than you use) will make a difference in the long run.  Just think about not having an electric bill for a moment.  I learned this by being homeless, in the desert for far too long now, using solar for power.  Sure, I'm looking at replacing $700 worth of batteries... that I've been abusing for 3 years.  Desert temps over 120F for over a month do a number on lead acid batteries.  How is solar a cushion?  No monthly electric bill.  Spend more time looking into multiple income streams.  Yes... that could mean multiple jobs outside the home.  It could also mean looking into products you can sell on Amazon, by finding drop shippers for that product.  You make the listing, the order goes to the drop shipper, you get your middle-man percentage.  It could mean you learn how to weave baskets, and then make unique creations by weaving in wire and other materials into the baskets as you go... maybe even limit yourself to using found materials... and then you sell them via Etsy and Pinterest.    Learn to knit with a loom... quicker, one needle, easier.  You can do it surfing the net or watching TV.  Sell scarves.... you can get yarn cheap at thrift stores.  Use a small loom, knit with paracord or nylon twine, and make tubes people can use to store plastic bags in.  You know... you stuff them in the top, and pull them out one at a time from the bottom.  Or... if you use a larger circular loom and paracord or nylon twine, you could make reusable sacks for groceries and such.  Go manly, and use a camouflage colored paracord.  Easier than learning how to use a shuttle to make a net, and you can get a pack of three different sized looms at any Michael's craft store for $10.  Make and sell those on Etsy/Pinterest.  The point isn't go become Captain Crafty.  The point is... you buy the home, and while you have the energy and drive, you work your ass off in as many different ways to get money coming in.  Even multiple trickles are better than depending on that one big stream.  If the house is a house, and has a yard, turn it into a garden and grow your own food.  Seriously.  I learned THAT growing up.  Dad and the neighbor went halves on a roto-tiller.  We had a separate two car garage, and some land, and he chewed out a plot about four times the size of that garage.  Half went to corn, and half went to... tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cukes, zucchini, carrots, radishes, pumpkins, watermelons, squash... tried romaine one year I think.  My mom added some spearmint one year to a back corner, and that stuff took OVER.  We couldn't get rid of it.  4 boys, mom and dad, for perspective.  We always had too much corn.  I remember trying to sell it by the road.  Didn't have the traffic for it.  It was my equivalent to the lemonade stand.  This was in the village of Hope, Rhode Island, in the 1970's and 80's.  Dad worked a full-time job in industrial insulation as well during all of this.  Most of it.  There was a transition period of a few years, when he left one large company to work for another, made up of other people who left the same company.  Something like this isn't creating an income stream... unless you too decide to sell veggies locally, but it would significantly improve your diet, and reduce your outflow of cash on food.  Having a house, specifically the land to do it on, makes it possible.  Your need to change your relationship with money makes it an imperative.  Are there local ordinances against collecting rainwater... to use for watering a garden, as an example.  Don't be surprised... many cities and towns do indeed have ordnances/regulations regarding the collection of rainwater.  In some areas, it can be a breeding hazard for mosquitoes.  As in, they don't want to increase the places where they breed.  But if you \*can\* collect rainwater, then water bills can be reduced as well, especially in the case of building a garden.  Comfortable ***again***?  You can't afford to get comfortable for a ways to go.  You aren't at any kind of pinnacle or peak.  The cliff you feel like you just finished climbing back up to?  That's just a big ledge.  You've got conversations with financial specialists in your future, about things like ***portfolios***.  You've got applications to fill out, looking for part-time dishwasher or cashier work.   You've got internet searches for products, and brainstorming sessions ahead.  While you still can, life has to be about function... not form.  I know... in a perfect world, a balance would be best.  But you are making up for lost time and lost ground.  You are your girlfriend have to either commit and get married, so you can use that status to your financial gain, or some to some kind of binding arrangement so you can both work your asses off trying to find big and small ways of either changing how and where money goes out, or changing how and where it comes from going in.  Then.  MAYBE once you can cover emergencies... MAYBE you can coast a little.  But don't get comfortable until AFTER you've got the safety net in place.  Don't settle for the illusion of comfort just because you got here.  That's what will ruin it all when the unexpected occurs.  And you already know what it is like to have the unexpected catch you when you weren't ready for it.  I still say this is the wrong sub for this conversation.
zobgqu,,j0mhicd,Pretty sure OP is just renting
zobgqu,,j0mqodr,OK?  Does that mean it is better to rant, than to potentially learn how to do things so one doesn't feel the need to rant in the future?  The OP needs to focus on other things.... things OTHER than what are obviously on their mind right now.  Those things that the OP needs to focus on instead, are what are going to alleviate the fears they have right now.
zobgqu,,j0mqylc,Just saying, a lot of the stuff you suggested focusing on doesn't apply to renters.  Edit: and also, yeah, sometimes people just need to vent/rant.
zobgqu,,j0n7mbq,Odd.  You "defending" someone for having a right to speak as they say fit... and you give me shit for doing the same.  Interestingly hypocritical.  Especially since I didn't say ANYTHING to shut them down.  I only described the path ahead of them, so they could focus on what they have to do, and not what \*might\* happen based on bad past events.  >a lot of the stuff you suggested focusing on doesn't apply to renters  The OP is BUYING a house and was paranoid about losing it.  Why the fuck would I say stuff that applied to RENTERS?  Look.  You want to post on reddit and pander to the audience, you go ahead and be you.  I post TO the original poster, because I'm speaking TO the original poster, about what THEY put in their post.  Not what you, or anyone else reading these posts wants to read.

zobgqu,,j0nf68q,At time of reading-It appears OP is Renting and based on past experiences has A Lot of anxiety about this going South as the others did.  Understandable.  Taking things slow, deep breaths, and getting plenty of rest will all help OP once it‚Äôs time to look over the rental contract.  The counseling suggestion for OP makes sense as well considering the anxiety in the post, but I understand needing to prioritize first and get ahead on safety nets as much as possible.

zoauma,j0lxtpf,,>Now is the winter of our discontent  Shakespeare (actually, Richard the Third's opening line)  >Why is the rum always gone?  Johnny Depp (actually, Captain Jack Sparrow, multiple times)  ...  When the temperatures hit the 90's in April, and all the seasonal imports flee to leave the 200 or less full-timers to our own devices... I never think "why is it always winter?".  When it starts hitting the 120F ceiling in July, and I know there's another month ahead of daily temps cresting that, I never think "why is it always winter?"  It is always winter where you are, because you will not move yourself to a warmer climate.... whether that is in your mind, or it describes where your body is.  You\*can\* be in a summer climate physically, while only thinking cold, desolate, barren thoughts... winter in your mind.  But if you are only talking about how where you live is always winter.. you HAVE to move somewhere south.  There really is a world south of Yellowknife (the only city in the Northwest Territories in Canada).  I'm guessing as to a location, of course... but humans historically migrate seasonally.  If it is always winter where you are, head towards the equator.  If it is always winter in your soul... that's a completely different discussion for a completely different reddit sub.
zoauma,,j0lybhf,No, I got cut off. I was basically ranting about why it's always winter when I have to go dig a foxhole somewhere. I still feel guilty for getting an apartment in the summer last year, and finding myself homeless when the snow fell. I'm in the same situation now, while I have the flu & tendonitis in both elbows. This may be the year I die from hypothermia.
zoauma,,j0me2zi,Maybe.  Maybe you suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, and you get involuntarily depressed every winter, and you subconsciously make mistakes and choices that put you on the streets.  Maybe you live in a city or town that sees seasonal employment, and when the work closes up for the winter, there's no money for housing.  Maybe [you are the grasshopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper) who doesn't work hard to prepare for the winter.  It isn't the best of Aesop's fables... it isn't the best of any fables.  But there is truth in it.  It does indeed apply to some.  Ok.  You have family.  Could you communicate with them over a distance, from a warmer climate, for all the connection they appear to have to you at the moment?  You are going to be homeless in the snow.  For whatever it is worth, this "family" doesn't seem all that close to you.  If it is mostly phone calls, emails, texts, and DMs... you could do that from anywhere.  If you ABSOLUTELY have to be somewhere close by, even if none of them will help you out... then you have to CHANGE something.  Maybe it is the work you do, or the work you think you should do.  Maybe you have to give up something, and bend to the rules that get you into a shelter and transitional housing.  Maybe you have to tell a family member you are sorry, and make amends.  Maybe you have to agree to rehab.  Maybe you have to compromise and use the shelter system in a town or city nearby.  Maybe you have to learn about better winter gear, and prepare for this possibility if it happens with frequency.  Is there a Salvation Army Thrift store near you?  Go to the nearest one.  Ask them where their Administrative office is, and tell them you want to know because you are homeless and you want to sign up for assistance.  They will either direct you to the location of the admin office, or they will assist you.  This involves letting them ask you questions so they can create a profile in their database... just like getting assistance from any other organization.  Then, they will load you up with clothing, a coat, and whatever gear they have available, or vouchers so you can GET that stuff at their thrift stores.  This means sleeping bags, possibly a tent, maybe even a Coleman stove.... boots, socks, etc.  I, and everyone else out here, have no idea why you are always homeless in the winter.  **Only you** have the information that leads to knowing what has to change.  And you have to change it.
zoauma,,j0lyeqb,I have family here, or I would have moves south years ago.
zoauma,j0oabdl,,if it's too cold for you, move somewhere warmer
zoauma,,j0ti8if,I have a child, otherwise I would have left for warmer parts years ago. There's supposedly veteran's housing in Kentucky somewhere.
zoauma,j0lyn59,,Because it's not summer? Because the planet needs a set amount of time to rebuild everything
zo3ak3,j0lvc2l,,>And so are the police who work on the outreach team, we see them around most nights, **and the council's good too**. Moving into a hostel will be the first step forward for me, then you get to speak to outreach workers more often and they get you on the right track.  That was from one of the guys (Roy) interviewed.  I emphasized the part that stood out to me, in bold.  It stood out, because to the best of my knowledge, the council authority decides if they can get into a shelter or hostel, and if they can get any kind of permanent housing.  He got into a hostel, but decided not to take the bed, because he didn't want to abandon his homeless friend, the other guy interviewed.  The other guy... Paul... the interview doesn't cover why the council didn't say he could stay in a hostel.  Seems kind of like the council has been 50% good.  But then you get to this information...  >Figures show 11 people were sleeping rough in Hull and seven in the East Riding, according to the latest headcount in Autumn 2021, out of 2,440 across England.  and then...  >A total of 362 people were classed as homeless, living with no fixed address, from April to June 2022 in Hull, while a further 418 faced becoming homeless. In the East Riding, the figures were 207 and 58 respectively.  In a year... from 11 homeless to 362 (expected to be 780), in Hull.  From 7 to 207 (expected to be 265) in East Riding, again, in just a year.  **Huge increases**.  It is no wonder local council authorities can't get people into hostels and permanent housing.... they had no way to expect these kinds of numbers.  Maybe the council really has been 100% good, considering they likely have nowhere to put the homeless.  Although, it is weird they can't put them right back in the home they came out of, if they lived in Hull just before they went homeless.  I mean... the council should be able to step in at some point, and agree to take care of the rent/lodging fee, just like they would pay for the permanent housing if it was available.  It is one thing if someone is homeless, and they arrive in Hull in that state.  It is something else if they were a Hull resident, and then they were a Hull homeless.  They just got put out of housing in Hull... the council should be able to put them right back in, since they get to decide things like this.  I guess it would depend on whether or not the person was in contact with the council before they went homeless... or how much time passed between going homeless and contacting the local council.  There was an article posted here a few months ago, about a couple in the UK had to live in their car for... I think it was seven months, but it could have been two years... waiting for council housing.  It was a long time, and the couple **did** get the place to live.  The local council hadn't dragged their feet, however.  They had multiple properties that had to be rehabilitated and returned to a livable condition, and they kept the couple appraised of the progress along the way while they waited.  This kind of blew me away...  >2,440 \[rough sleepers\] across England  Less than 3000 homeless sleeping outside in 2021... for the whole of England.  Hull has a homed population of about 200k.  There are estimates that NYC has almost that many homeless alone.
zo32t6,j0km1d2,,Factory job. I have social anxiety as well. Factory work means you can focus on your menial task and go home. It's very limited socially.  I grew and went from a meat packer, to a team leader, to supervisor, and now a manager. You'll learn soon that social anxiety doesn't prevent you from growing in factory environments. I can talk about work tasks all day. But socializing is a no go.  Office work is a lot more socializing and politics lower on the chain than factory labor.
zo32t6,j0lqsb3,,In a couple of other posts, you mentioned that you are "permanently suicidal." If I were you, I'd get counseling before you start looking for a job. It's going to be hard to do any work in that frame of mind.
zo32t6,,j0manfy,I'm suicidal because I don't have a future. Once I find a job I can maintain for the long run to avoid homelessness, I will be a lot less suicidal.
zo32t6,,j0mhtg1,makes sense... and all the studies that led to the housing first model of treating homelessness support this.
zo32t6,j0kmq11,,I'm pretty sure this conversation is going to include a ton of suggestions that won't work for you, for one reason or another.  I'm gathering that the list of conditions which dictate what work you can and cannot do, is only going to get longer.  You also don't realize that what you need, is going to have to be extraordinarily specific.. not a generic job suggestion.  You have a bulging disc, so bending is out.  Completely?  As in, you can't stand for hours working at sorting off a conveyer belt?  Is lifting and moving stuff out as well?  You know, where you lift with your knees instead of your back?  Can you sit for hours, putting sheets of metal into a press, pushing a button, and then removing the formed product.. sitting, and twisting frequently basically?  I get it.  Jobs that require interacting with people are out.  So, if you really can't do physical work, like janitorial, or maintenance, electrical line inspection and repair, construction, most factory work...  ... Night security that doesn't involve making physical rounds, maybe?  Just watching cameras all the time.  Of course, suggestions don't mean much if there is none of that kind of work where you are.  Manufacturing and factory work depends on the factories where you are, and what jobs they offer.  There may not BE any production line jobs anywhere near you, if you could even do them.  Have you considered learning to code?  $102 Billion dollars spent on mobile games in 2021.. more than console and PC games combined.  You wouldn't have to deal with strangers if you were part of a team.. just the people you work with.  I did not say you should do tech support.  Or you could learn to code for the web.. or learn what you need to, to come up with a necessary app.  That is a career path you could pursue on a library computer.  Also, you can likely work remotely.  ... which sounds like what you want.. a remote job that doesn't involve customer service or require any skills you do not have right now.  That would mean you likely have to learn the skills to get the job that will satisfy your requirements.  And if you have to learn a new skill, coding offers the widest range of possibilities that should meet what you need.
zo32t6,,j0kp0oq,Hey, thanks for your comment :-)  The thing with my bulging disc is that sometimes I feel pain that makes it hard for me to walk, especially when I'm getting up from a chair. I think maybe I CAN bend over, but sometimes it's going to be painful. I can actually stand for hours and sort off a conveyer belt, I'd actually love to do that job and hope there is one in my country (I'm from Israel, the shittiest most expensive country in the world). I can lift some stuff, but not if they're too heavy, I think I can lift up to 3 kg of boxes and stuff like that. Maybe I can press metal sheets? It depends on how painful it's going to be, I have never tried that so I can't tell you if I can do it.  When it comes to interacting with people, I can work in second hand clothing stores or second hand book stores, because "what you see in the store is what there is", so they're not supposed to have any reason to harass me, but it's hard to get such jobs in my country. I can also work in stores where I deal with one client at a time, hoping I don't get yelled at, because if I get yelled at too many times, I collapse, snap, and might lose that job.  Right now I work as an archivist in a university. I read some stuff and describe them on an Excell table, it's like data entry, but with more thinking. This job is not forever. It's project, pretty long one, but it still has an end, so I have to think about life after that job. I doubt if I find another job like this, most archives require interacting with people, and maybe even multitasking, and also, most archives are underfunded, so it's next to impossible to find a job in the field.  I once worked at a seasonal job at a book fare and it was nice, but they didn't pay enough.  Maybe programming is the answer. I thought that only university graduates can get a job in programming, but if there are openings for self learners, maybe I'll go that path.
zo32t6,,j0kpyei,There are programming jobs for those with education, work experience, or a portfolio of self-work.  You should be able to somehow prove your ability to code.  The fact that you are in Israel is extremely relevant, regarding what jobs are available to pick from.  What would be involved with making the job permanent?  Have you looked into other archivist positions?  Museums?  Galleries?  Other universities?
zo32t6,j0kkawp,,You could do a call center type job from home. Look on indeed.
zo32t6,,j0kkthe,Call center, even from home, means lots of abuse from the public. I don't want my home to be the place where I get yelled at.
zo32t6,,j0kkx78,Well, not all are the same. For instance I signed up for a program requiring a call to get me started. It's no cost. I requested the call....I doubt the callers get much abuse.
zo32t6,,j0kwoy6,Which one
zo32t6,,j0kwqxl,Perry health.
zo32t6,,j0l4y9t,Yo where‚Äôd you get a home from?
zo32t6,,j0l52bc,This person is not homeless
zo32t6,,j0l78s4,Must‚Äôve got the last one.
zo32t6,j0lvql6,,I am going to say this, given I have worked in customer service (not a call center) and I have a quite a bit of factory work experience.   Through the many factories I have worked at, very rarely did I find one that was a light factory, with very little movement and put some type of strain on my body. The only type of factories that I did work at that was light in movement was when I worked at a (placebo) iron making company, where we just put the iron in a machine and the machine did everything from up, and we pull the iron from the crane, band wrap the machine, and just do a lot of paperwork. Or when I worked at factories where all I did was pick and pack orders and practically just drive a forklift all day.    There have been factory jobs where I have made so much money weekly but had to work 10 hour shifts, six days a week with double time, and 1.5 in a half. The money was great and all, but I had little room to enjoy life. The perks of working in factories is that you could easily make a lot of money, however do not put all of your bags in one egg. Factory work even if it is easier work can put a strain on your body.   Whenever I worked customer service, I had more room for work, but I suffered the most not from customers (for the most part) but from management and they were worse than most management than I experience in the workplace.      Since you do have a physical condition, I would be cautious of factories to work in.    I would also see if there would be ways to expand any skills you may have or be interested in, and gain certificates or anything that would generate you more income than entry level positions. Inflation is going up the roof over the past few years, and many jobs do not cover the expenses of rent let alone, the rest of the annoying bills we have to pay.   There are going to be narcissist and all types of people who are dysfunctional and try to pull power trips on people, even if you have worked for the company for a lot of years. No matter what jobs you work at, they are going to be there. I have NOT YET, had a job without someone who is just wicked, vile, and get their self-worth in how they put others down, or trying to get brownie points on becoming manager, when the position is not even open, or they are underqualified for.   I'm going to just say this and it took me years to understand this. Since these types of people exist and will love abusing others, and are just straight up bullies. How you react to these individuals in these situations will make a world of a difference to your experience. Remember, you are there to collect your check, and do you thing, and take care of responsibilities. These narcissists and everything else that work at these factories or places are too. How you react to these individuals, will determine if you find stability in the future or not. Remember, they will always be around to make our lives miserable.   The path you should choose is not if the job is able to pay your bills alone which is the main reason we work. But to see what you can gain out of the current job you have, and build on top of that. Doing this will open more doors for you to gain more money later on in life as you continue to gain experience in whatever job you work at.   For example, let's say I worked at a grocery store and I started from the very bottom. Let's say at this grocery store there are opportunities for me to learn how to drive a forklift, but I do not have forklift experience. My objective working at this retail store, is to drive the forklift and become experienced with it, so I can take my forklift driving skills from a grocery/retail store, and be able to easily obtain jobs that pays more driving a forklift.
zo32t6,j0lwuks,,I would look for remote customer service jobs or remote office jobs. This way you don't have to put your back at risk and you can do something you're already used to but away from the office. It's only a little bit better, but it is a tiny bit better.  ..... Sorry forgot to mention. If you have a car to work from or you can work from a library or you have some little spot or it's not super loud that you can work from. Work from home may not work for you if you do not have a vehicle.  If that's the case. Try looking for an office job in a factory? Sometimes. They have very small staff for the administrator side of it like five people
zo32t6,,j0maaxl,But customers are going to yell at me, and at some point, I won't be able to handle it and I will collapse and snap, which will lead me to lose that job. I need a survivable job.
zo32t6,,j0mauuw,I would consider talking to a case manager and seeing if applying for SSI disability is an option for you. If you just want to try to get a job? I would look at getting whatever you can get for now but going to school online and training for some kind of job where it's very individual and not a team / lots of people environment and definitely not customer service related
zo32t6,,j0pa42o,In your country, are you expected to take nasty behavior with a smile at all times without setting boundaries? Courtesy is a 2-way street. Maybe you need training about what to do with nasty customers? I usually immediately turn them over to management. Sometimes I will point out their hostility if I can get a word in edgewise to ask them to be more courteous. The reality is that women are verbally abused and harassed a lot more often than men so it‚Äôs going to happen. You need bosses who will support & back you up when you have a hostile customer.   Factory work will probably be too much on your disc. You can make it worse. I fixed my dog‚Äôs discs (they were knocked out of alignment and he couldn‚Äôt walk) with ruta graveolens and glucosamine chondroitin. Now there are peptide injections which may help you heal completely, see r/peptides.
zo32t6,,j0pazxf,I'd rather make more damage to my disc than deal with abusive customers. I worked in places where the management backed me up, but it didn't help. I can't do this work. I can't be someone's punching bag, otherwise, I become a lot more violent. I'm already showing symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. I scream and throw lots of tantrums for no reason. I don't think I can mentally handle customer service jobs. I also can't handle multitasking.
zo32t6,,j0pdd1d,Do they have disability programs there? Can you try to get involved in MDMA therapy trials? Might help   https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidcarpenter/2020/02/27/israel-makes-a-big-move-toward-the-acceptance-of-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd/amp/
zo32t6,,j0pdto1,Also you should get your back fixed before attempting to do physical labor.   Are you sleeping much? It‚Äôs so much harder for me to stay calm when I am seriously sleep deprived. I use DL-phenylalanine otc to help with mood.
zo32t6,j0m6pl9,,If you can find a good Factory job where you work a machine with very little interaction with your coworkers that would probably be ideal for you, I have a cousin who absolutely cannot stand interacting with most people. He looked into a job and literally got the machine at the very back far left of the factory, he goes to work 30 minutes early so he is there before anyone gets there and waits 15 minutes after work until everyone else leaves. That works fantastic for him
zo32t6,j0nst4p,,Learn a skill, trade, or profession that will remain in demand.
zo32t6,j0rwclx,,Hey there, I don‚Äôt know how much experience you have but I too worked at a call center where we called people on behalf of the CDC and did health surveys for Covid and such.

I quit when I got a job with a furniture store, small staff and not many customers (people only buy furniture if needed so it‚Äôs not like an ‚Äúoh lets stop here for fun‚Äù kinda place) anyways I‚Äôm one of 3 people who are the office staff (office admin ) and I take payments, do cash reports, filing, send e-mails, etc. I picked it up pretty quick. Most the time I‚Äôm just chilling in my phone and not doing much lol. The staff is small and like family. If you can I‚Äôd recommend trying to find a small office similar type job. It‚Äôs been the best one I‚Äôve had and the most relaxed. My boss even gave everyone a free thanksgiving turkey this year.  Smaller staffs seem to be better. Good luck!
znz0y3,j0kc8hm,,Just remember, 4 years after learning how to better navigate this alien environment, even the throat of a Budong, with a half-mad slave trying to save him by posing as electromagnetic candy, John got married, had a son, and saved the universe.  So even bad trips can have good endings.
znynaj,j0jxfq3,,Sorry pal.
znynaj,j0mc7ow,,Start hitchhiking
znynaj,j0lwbdu,,Hitchhike to Fort Worth. Or call shelters in Fort Worth and see if one can send someone to pick you up.
znynaj,j0nlkdh,,Update, had one from there let me get out of the cold and sleep in their car. I'm screwed tonight tho. No shelter had space and I went literally everywhere my phone could look up
znxss6,j0kw32g,,I don't understand why you ask these questions over and over. What are you looking for?
znxss6,,j0lkau4,I would guess they really want to live in the Pacific Northwest, and they believe there's a homeless haven of a city up there because they WANT there to be one, and they are trying to get strangers to confirm that this mystical place exists without telling anyone they are looking for it.  I just don't understand why they won't just say what they are actually looking for, since that is what will define a place that is "best" for them.
znxss6,,j0oigjl,Fair enough. Ok, here goes...  I am at risk of becoming homeless and I am trying to research the best place to go in the event that I actually do become homeless. I have just gone through a huge amount of trauma in my life and may be forced to start my life all over again. It doesn't really matter where that "mystical" place is because I don't think there is any place left on Earth that isn't some dystopian garbage pit.  To put it in really straight-forward terms, if I heard from 50 different people that a specific state/city was a decent place to be homeless, I would then assume that was the consensus and it might just weigh on my decision on where I would go if I actually do end up homeless.  I hope that helps. It's the truth.
znxss6,,j2y9ub9,>in the event that I actually do become homeless.  Fair enough.  Let me take this sideways for a second.  What is the best food?  Do you expect that there is actually a single answer to that question?  Different people are going to have different reasons for why they believe their "best" food is the best.  Are they wrong?  Not when they are talking about what is "best" for themselves.  When people start telling you what is "best" for you... how do you normally react?  Do you appreciate how other people know what you should be saying and doing, rather than YOU deciding what you should say and do... because they know what is best for you?  Again... are you looking for the best place for services that are available to the homeless, to make their life as a homeless person as comfortable as possible... even if that homelessness lasts months or years?  Is that what is best for you?  Or, is the best place FOR YOU to be homeless, a place where there is abundant work YOU can do, so that however uncomfortable the homelessness is, you can EARN the money you need to not be homeless anymore?  Silicon Valley is full of mobile homeless who have jobs... good paying jobs.  They just cannot afford to live anywhere near where they work.  They would spend more time in a daily commute than they would spend working.  Some of those people have come up with comfortable mobile solutions, so they can essentially \*be\* mobile homeless indefinitely.  Where I am, in Slab City... you can be homeless for years.  Services like MedCal and CalFresh (medical and food) don't require state residency.  You can do this with little to no money.  You just have to do this in the desert, 4 miles from anything... where summers will see temperatures over 120F for a month.  There's no work to speak of... and what work there is requires Spanish as a primary language.  Yes... it is easier to get work here if you don't speak English, as opposed to only speaking English.  Of course, you aren't staying in an Emergency Shelter here... you'd have to build/buy/obtain some kind of shelter on your own.  BUT... if what is "best" for you, is a place where you can be homeless with people who love to party all the time.... then this place fits the bill.  Olympia, Washington used to be a nice place to be homeless.  You could live in a vehicle out of the Park N Ride lot on the Lacey/Olympia line... two libraries, food bank next door to the mission that had a soup kitchen lunch, morning coffee, free showers and laundry... in the middle of downtown Olympia next to the bus station.  They even have a slowly growing Tiny House community there.  Then, 2018 saw a state supreme court ruling on the state's Homesteading Act, essentially declaring any vehicle with Washington places a viable "home".... and now Olympia has a ton of RVs and other vehicles parked all over the place.  So, not long ago, Olympia would have been "best"... but it isn't anymore.  >I have just gone through a huge amount of trauma in my life and may be forced to start my life all over again.  Well... how \***you**\* start your life over again, is different from how someone else would start their life over again.  Some people would want to get married.  Others would want to NEVER consider marriage.  Some people would want to learn a completely different career... other people would want to find a different place that would give them the career opportunities they have always pursued but never found.  I mean... let's face it... if you go homeless trying to be an actor in Walla Walla Washington, you might want to try a different city to be an actor in, if you wanted to continue with that career choice.  Some people start their life over again by joining the military.  Some even get jobs with traveling carnivals essentially running away and joining the circus.  Different point of view again?  You are asking about what the best frozen treat is, without ever mentioning whether or not you are lactose intolerant.  The best one for you, isn't going to be the best one for me... if you \*are\* lactose intolerant.  The **SPECIFICS** about what is **BEST** for **YOU**, are vitally important to deciding what the BEST place for you to be homeless in is.  If you can't stand the rain, being homeless in the Pacific Northwest is a BAD idea.  Do we know whether or not you are going to mind 110-200 days of rain out of the year?  No, we don't.  One of the things that makes this place the "best" for me... is the heat.  I have eczema that manifests on my face... the cooler it is, the flakier it gets.  During the summers here, I don't flake.  I'm not scraping the dead skin off my face with a blade.  Do I expect my reason for what is "best" to effect your judgement as to what is best?  Maybe if you liked the heat, and you wanted a "natural" solution to eczema as well.  Do I know anything like that about you?  No.  I don't.  >if I heard from 50 different people that a specific state/city was a decent place to be homeless, I would then assume that was the consensus  Do you realize that in MOST states, you cannot get assistance... like SNAP food stamps... without being able to prove RESIDENCE in that state?  If you are going to move from where you can currently probably prove residence, to a state that REQUIRES proof of residence to be able to stay at a shelter, get food stamps, or sign up for housing... shouldn't THAT weigh heavily on your decision to be homeless there?  If you are going to move somewhere?  Both [Washington](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1364) and [Oregon](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1332) require proof of residency to sign up for the benefits and programs designed to help the homeless in those states.  Are you planning on starting your life over again, homeless in a state where you aren't eligible for housing or food assistance?  Are you somehow convinced that you can mystically bypass these requirements, just because you \*want\* to live in the Pacific Northwest?  So.  Again.  What EXACTLY is going to make the place you decide to be homeless in, the BEST place for YOU to be homeless in?  I still do not understand why you are so ardently avoiding talking about what your specific needs and wants are, so you can be informed of what will fit BEST for you.  It is like trying to get people to tell you what the best shoes you should buy are... without ever telling anyone what they will be used for... an event, work... work on slippery floors, construction, dressing up, being comfortable around the house, etc.  If you don't tell anyone you are going to be wearing them in the snow 6 months out of the year... you can't complain when someone says that an open-toed sandal is the **BEST** shoe.
znxss6,,j0oipe2,Please see my reply below further down where I answer this question as best I can.
znxss6,,j0oqtnl,Imo you should get on all of the housing lists. There are different types. To prevent homelessness. I wish I knew how to find out which areas have shorter lists. I emailed one that seemed to actually have a unit available asking how long is the wait. They replied that the waiting time for different incomes is different. I replied that it's for a person taking in 841. The SSI amount. No reply. Maybe because I wasn't asking for myself.  One website shows nationwide for section 8, and some lists stay open year round. You can apply anytime.  What bongart is asking is what is best to you. A place that will get you into a shelter and into perma housing or a place that has lots of soup kitchens and let's you hang out in a tent or what about a place would cause it to rank best for you personally?  My city shelter gets people into perma housing if you get a job. One guy that is sort of known around town got one without working, but I've no idea how. If he's got disability or what. He still panhandles at convenience stores he is now able to go back to an appointment instead of the woods.  Cant say this is a good place to go. Food stamps are for three months only for those not working. Rents are high. Anyway my opinion is to concentrate on preventing homelessness.   Do you qualify for lifeline, food stamps, and or the affordable connectivity program? Do you go to food banks? Can you devote time each day to finding and getting on lists for various types of housing? What is going to cause you to become homeless? Is your job insecure? Do you have a back up plan? Are you too Ill to keep working? What is the situation? Maybe renting a room would allow you to save money. Maybe people could help advise if we knew the situation.
znxss6,,j0suyef,First of all, thank you ever so much for taking the time to look into this and for your detailed reply. I really appreciate it!.  Well, to be honest, I am an older man who is very poor and the possability of becoming homeless looms large in my mind. What I am/was looking for or hoping to get out of this was to find a state/city that is very liberal/progressive, has an abundance of resources and then get a bus ticket or hike there if I need to at some point. Once there, I had hoped to get into a shelter or motel and find an advocate or social worker and get into more permanent housing and apply for other services if needed.  I've heard that in LA they are going to start sending advocates out to the various homeless camps and offer people motel rooms but I'm a little scared of LA because of all the horrible things I've read in the news. I've heard San Francisco mentioned a number of times as well as San Diego. Not sure which one is better. A few other towns have popped up too.  Again, many thanks!.
znxss6,,j0txq9i,In your situation, are you anticipating a job loss? Loss of ability to work? Would you have a car? One problem seems to be that anywhere with good services is overrun with people competing for resources. If you'd have a car to sleep in, perhaps you'd have better luck in a small town with fewer people needing help. A small town nearish to me with a motel for a mere 200/ week, their shelter filled up for the very first time a few months ago. It had empty beds every night before that, and one would think they won't stay full.  It seems like you wouldn't anticipate being able to work in your location, you'd need services that house people regardless, is that right? Asking because in my city, like many others, they help you find employment to lead to housing, not so much 'here is a free apartment'  although there are exceptions.  Also because if you won't have any income my ideas about low income apartments and section 8 lists are worthless, although for the latter people with no income do qualify, and perhaps getting on as many section 8 lists as you can now, since you're willing to relocate,,,,maybe just maybe a spot would open up in one to prevent homelessness OR to get you out faster. Ie day a list is 2 years out and you go homeless in a year. You'd be glad for that spot a year after that.  The list moves rapidly once open. At least in my area, the long wait part is for them to open the application process. Once that happens and you apply, things move along at a good clip.   You do not have to be homeless to apply for section 8. Most people who apply do so because they are spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent and are seeking something affordable.   Some lists never close! You could get on them now if they accept applicants from out of their area.
znxss6,,j123h8e,Sorry for the belated reply. No, I'm unable to work and have no car so I would be arriving with nothing but the shirt on my back and maybe a small backpack, phone, etc. My ultimate goal would be to obtain housing and not end up on the streets forever. Not really sure where I would go or end up but it seems like everything I read/hear/watch points to Cali but I've also heard some horror stories so who knows. I've watched some vids on the slabs (slab city) and depending on the people there at any given time, it seems like it can be quiet and peaceful for a time and then, over time, new people move in or old ones move out so the dynamic changes and it might stay peaceful or there might be a lot of tweakers or people with mental health issues, etc. Also, what happens if you just show up at the slabs one day with no car, tent or camper?. I mean, where would a person stay?.
znxss6,,j13i3bp,Bongart has quite a few posts about slab city.
znxss6,,j14zopy,What points to Cali? Their extreme lack of housing for the biggest homeless population in the country?
znxss6,,j16lt8u,Just various things I've read about thier "housing first" initiative, the plan to build more affordable housing and tackle homelesness in LA, warm weather, lots of talk about how "kind and generous" people are in SF, vids I've watched, the general consensus that seems to point to the west coast being a better (but not necessarily great) place to be if your homeless, etc.  I mean, tbh, I'm sure that they don't just roll out the red carpet for you the minute you arrive, 5-star hotel and a bottle of bubbly. It's tough everywhere but it seems like the west coast is the best horrible place to live if your homeless.  Also looking into Ohio, Florida, Colorado and a few other places. Seriously, I think there really is no "best place" anymore. You just have to kind of stumble into the right place at the right time.
znxss6,,j16m1ja,They've been planning that for decades and they never do it. They can't build. Zoning issues.
znxss6,,j16mu8m,Lol yeah, I know. It's all nonsense but one can at least hope that with every basketful of unkept promises, at least a few will make it through the meat grinder. You have to live somewhere so you pick the "best place" based on a personal decision/preference and if it doesn't work out, you move on to the next because what else can you do really?.
znxss6,j0k50u3,,San Francisco and the Bay Area in general WAS nice but has taken a major nosedive for the past 10 years and especially has been brutal since covid. It's real nice once you have been established or have a working RV or are lucky to get into housing but it's just too many people, not enough resources. Cities and CHP/CalTrans are also breaking up camps because of fire hazards or traffic hazards. Little havens are breaking down, golden gate park is cracking down on "crime" because they're losing tourist dollars, peoples park in Berkeley will be student housing and all the spots people set up along the highways are getting broken up. Even the more industrial parts of Richmond are cracking down. There's a large camp past Chevron that's getting moved out because Amazon is putting in a distribution center.  There's just no where left to go.
znxss6,j0kbir3,,In what regard, is this place to be deemed as being the Best City to be Homeless?  Do you mean, best because you can be homeless almost indefinitely there?  By best, do you mean the place where you can get out of being homeless the fastest?  By best, do you mean the place where it is easiest to connect to available resources?  Can you define "best"?  Because I live in one of the places that would qualify as "best", depending on how you define the word.  I would not recommend it as a destination to almost anyone.. but it is still best, as far as the length of time you can be homeless here, while still having access to services that don't require proof of state residency to receive them.  And the fact that you can build yourself a castle made of pallets, and no one will bulldoze it down.  In the USA.  No snow, and not much rain either.  And.. no police patrols or rousting.. you are left alone to abuse yourself as you choose.  Would that fit your definition of Best?
znxss6,,j0n0j2d,Yes that sounds good
znxss6,,j0n891k,If that is what \*you\* define as best (as opposed to the OP), then I'd say you failed at choosing what is "best".  But it doesn't matter.  If that's the kind of place that sounds best for you, it is in southern California, just waiting in the desert.
znxss6,,j0r5u37,How do you survive , in terms of food and water ? Are there any abandoned camps with resources to repurpose ?
znxss6,,j0r7y9q,Bongart lives in Slab City, it says so on his profile.... Google the place
znxss6,,j0r8aqt,I‚Äôve been twice . I was asking him
znxss6,,j2xoh97,Ok...  I have a job, taking care of the 77 year old man living in the bus across from my camp.  I work for him every day, and I've done so since September 6th of 2021.  I fill and start his generator, fill it again in the afternoon in the summer, get the gas for the generator every 3 to 6 days, do his shopping, kill the rats, handle the construction, and otherwise I'm on call by walkie talkie from 7:30am until Midnight.  I had one day off in June of 2022, when I went into the hospital for dehydration.  For this, I get paid $6.25 a day, or $200 a month.  Before that... I'd sell what I could at the Trade Circle on Saturdays.  I pay my $40 to get the 275 gallon cube filled with Niland water... now it's $45.  That lasts months.  I used to get food stamps, but when I lost access to the PO box I was using at the time, and when social services seemed incapable of fulfilling my request to change my mailing address to General Delivery... I ceased to get SNAP.  When I secure another mailing address, I'll get SNAP again.  Otherwise, I survive in regards to food, on what I can get with what I earn... or by not eating.  I've at least got water.  Plenty of solar... just bad batteries so there's no power stored for the night.  Of course, this current "monsoon season" just means shit like clouds for a month.  Humanure outhouse (shit in a bucket, cover with peat moss, empty into a compost pile).  Crumbling recreational trailer that will never move again, built in the 1970's.  Before a camp can be abandoned, it has to be unoccupied.  Before it is unoccupied... SOMEONE will move into it.  More than likely, there were already a few different people living together in that camp, and not everyone leaves it at the same time.  When people leave a spot completely, their camps are either moved into, or quickly disassembled as you'd imagine, for building materials.  However, THESE days, anything even resembling an "abandoned" camp gets torched.  There are a few arsonists here.  In general though, when people are going to leave their spot, they telegraph their intentions, so that they can either SELL everything possible to the other Slabbers, or they maintain some measure of control in giving away the things they would otherwise leave behind.  People will pay cash for the shell of a trailer that has to be dragged to another location, regardless of whether or not it has wheels.  It's hard enough to keep people from stripping your camp while you are still living in it.
znxss6,,j4jxexn,Oddly the selling, stripping, and materials/items being deconstructed and carried or dragged off kind of (albeit a far stretch) reminds me of being deployed to Iraq.  I carried a busted up grill for what must‚Äôve been half a mile on base (Balad, Air base) it was nice having though.  Sold the bicycle for like half of what I paid for it before I left‚Ä¶better to make some back before it got stolen later or something eh?.  No arsonists incidents, but that‚Äôs no surprise.  Everything else was of course structured and fairly predictable in the extreme.  Enjoyed reading about your living in such a place, sounds wild. Really wild.
znxss6,,j4m119y,A summer here really puts things in a perspective.  I mean, there's a Navy SEAL training base a mile and half away, where they train SEALs in how to operate under harsh conditions.  And we are over here getting fucked up and sweating to whatever passive entertainment we can find, at the same time those boys are working their tails off.  Nothing like waking up to the sound of machine gun fire... or going to bed by it.  You know how sound travels in the desert too... yards away sounds like right next to you.  And I've never been a soldier.  Yes, wild.  A little of the wild from wild-n-crazy, but more of the wild from unattended overgrowth.  Like how a city might go back to the wild.  Not Tribal, and not feral.  Except, not with plants, but socially with baser actions and wants.
znxss6,,j0r8n77,if you'd been twice you would know the answer to your question wouldn't you?
znxss6,,j1734rh,He's covered it in multiple posts and comments, which you could read simply by clicking on his name... >.>
znxss6,j0jtxgr,,I was at a shelter in Salt Lake City. I was very close to everything. Two blocks from the library, there was doctors office next door and stuff to do if need be. I was lucky to be at the right place at the right time.
znxss6,,j0kr2x9,I‚Äôm about to be homeless in SLC soon which one is that?
znxss6,,j0l9b3x,I went to the Geraldine E King center. There's two others, the mens shelter is in South Salt Lake near the Jail there. And there's a coed one. The men and womens shelters have beds for the day where you have to check in before so you can "reserve it", as well as those that are going to be homeless for longer than 30 days. The coed shelter is mostly day beds. I would suggest going for the monthly beds as you can check in only once, and you have a bit more wiggle room. Though things might have changed since I left in the fall of 2020 to move back to Indiana.  Let me know if you have more questions.
znxss6,,j0l3r0r,I think HRC , it's in front of enclave at 1400 South apartments no?
znxss6,,j0l3xwq,I wouldn‚Äôt know, I haven‚Äôt been here in years. Sounds about right though, I‚Äôll check on Google Maps
znxss6,j0jz890,,NOT Southern California. It can be done but it's definitely difficult. Same is true for Florida
znxss6,,j0jzkxa,What are a few of the best places in Cali if your homeless?. Also, are there any decent places in Wash/Oreg?.  I read somewhere that if your homeless in Cali, you should stick to the coastline because it's supposed to be more liberal/progressive. Not sure if thats true but I read it somewhere recently.
znxss6,,j0k0hn6,Mountain view used to be okay. Not sure if it's like that anymore... If you have a car it's definitely easier. Santa Barbara has a program, but there's a really long wait. Los Angeles county has a few safe parking programs as well. But it's definitely still not easy. Being street homeless in Los Angeles county is horrific. I absolutely would not recommend Portland, Oregon because it's very much like Southern California now. It's extremely dangerous and I would put it just behind skid row kind of environment. Seattle is a little bit better, but it's definitely gotten a lot more dangerous in the last 5 to 6 years. Tacoma might be a good place. Green Bay Wisconsin is actually good but the winter is extremely harsh. I hear (read and word of mouth ) that a lot of homeless people go to North or South Carolina because they can put up tents in rural areas in the bushes and stuff where they can't be seen.
znxss6,,j0knr9n,Seattle has a lot of resources but you have to be in a shelter, our mayor does a lot of sweeps - one of the reasons the last mayor got booted out was because she let the city go to shit.    it's also cold and wet here for 8 months.
znxss6,,j0ljsqh,They have a lot of rules.  If you are going to limit mobile homeless to just an industrial section of the city, and limit them to 72 hours at a time in the same spot, you have to also increase the number of times you sweep the area for violators.  And that's just for people living in cars.  Remember, Seattle is #3 in the nation, behind LA and NYC, for the number of homeless residents.
znxss6,,j0ljdb0,Tacoma got flooded heavy with homeless after that Homesteading act ruling (EDIT: [Link](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/judge-rules-seattle-homeless-mans-truck-is-a-home/)) .. what... in 2015? (EDIT 2018)... about 1300 beds total in Pierce County for... get this... about 6500 homeless in 2017... to over 10k homeless in 2020.  So... Tacoma might have once been OK.  Olympia would have been even better, their services are more inclusive and easier to access.  Neither is "good" anymore, with the massive number of mobile homeless parked all over the place now.
znxss6,,j0lzpam,What was the Homesteading act ruling? Trying to Google what you‚Äôre referring to but came up empty.  It‚Äôs frustrating in Tacoma. I know several homeless folks who are good people and just trying to get on their feet, but they‚Äôre way outnumbered by bad actors. Regular assaults and rampant theft. Activists always want to make it look like the victims of these crimes are only corporations who deserve it, and every homeless person is just an angel down on their luck, but most of the time the victims are people who are poor themselves. We don‚Äôt have enough beds, but we also have a lot of folk that don‚Äôt want services because services come with rules. City government has done a piss poor job of addressing all of it.
znxss6,,j0m90wu,[https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/judge-rules-seattle-homeless-mans-truck-is-a-home/](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/judge-rules-seattle-homeless-mans-truck-is-a-home/)  2018, my bad....  ... and now you've got RVs lined up on the side of the road from the pot store to the hospital, in Olympia.  ... and Tacoma.  I had a very... unique job in Tacoma, for a few months in 2018.  I knew the manager of RE-PC in Tukwila.  He had to sell a multi-story home in Tacoma, when his wife got sick and couldn't navigate stairs.  The move was quick.  There was stuff to finish at the house that was for sale.  Some ~~homeless~~ people (we don't know if they were homeless) broke in, trashed a few rooms, and took the front door off the stove.  I was homeless in Olympia at the time.  He called me, and asked me to come be homeless at his house, to watch over it until it sold.  I had use of the garage as a "room", use of the bathroom... I cleaned and filled a couple of trailers full of stuff for the dump, parked in the back yard... sometimes slept in the house, sometimes slept in the truck.  And, he paid me $400 when I was done.  Hiring homeless, to protect empty property from vandals/thieves.  I still wish I could have turned that into something.  I know it would depend on getting realtors onboard.  Just not how to get them onboard.  EDIT: And again, to be fair... the numbers in Tacoma have exploded in the past few years, well beyond what Pierce County was ready to handle.  So.... at least if you can get into a vehicle, even if the registration is expired and you have no insurance, if you have a bill of sale and Washington plates, you have a home in Washington state.
znxss6,j0k4yaf,,Phoenix isn't bad for the winter unless it's below 40 degrees
znxss6,j0k9481,,Haven't been to enough cities to really give a detailed response. But in general I'd say moderate to high income area, with low homeless population in a blue state.
znxss6,j0k9l0b,,I live in the west coast, I think Santa Barbara has it better than San Diego. Basically California residents get easy access to food stamps, just need an ID and proof of income or you tell your case worker you‚Äôre unemployed and California will give it to you. When I leaves in Texas, they were not so kind about giving a ‚Äúhandout‚Äù and made me jump through way more hoops to get snap food stamps. cali also offers the best medical care for the poor (in the USA)‚Ä¶ but the downside is housing is super expensive here so getting out of homelessness is a struggle. Climate is decent here though, not too hot and not too cold, can easily sleep on the beach and have a nice view. Personally I stay out of Los Angeles‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt understand why some homeless people go to skid row when Orange County and Santa Barbara are safer, other then I guess because there are outreaches that go to to skid row each day and kind of offer to help whereas if you‚Äôre in OC, you have to go seek the help yourself. As someone who has experienced homelessness on and off in California because of how expensive housing is and inflation is crazy here, I am curious üëÄ to if the grass is greener on the other side like maybe Oregon, Washington‚Ä¶. I bet there‚Äôs tons of cities that are so small but have a better sense of community and help people who are in need.
znxss6,,j0ka1rz,Yeah, defo!. I would also be very interested to hear about Wash/Oreg and what are some homeless-friendly areas of these two states.
znxss6,,j0l7lbr,A lot of long-term homeless in WA & OR and I'm told we have phenomenal programs to assist the homeless. The states do require a TON of hoops to jump through and a lot of the housing up here isn't affordable because longtime Californian's sell their homes for cash and pay for real estate in WA & OR in full with the proceeds of selling in California.   The weather also sucks up here to be homeless depending on where you end up. The average rainfall is roughly nine months in the greater Portland Metro and SW Washington areas. A quick Google search nets Seattle receiving around eight months of rain and Seattle's cost of living is probably one of the highest in the nation, but, they DO have good programs for the homeless so it's a tradeoff. Portland also has good programs but again, cost of living and the challenges to get out of being homeless.  I've met folks who have been addicts and homeless here in SW Washington who have gone from sleeping on the streets, into a shelter, gotten into recovery, and now work for a state sub-contractor with their own place to call home. It can be done up here but there's a whole lot of hoops to jump through, doors to open and walk through, a lot of patience you need to have, and it has to be worked for.   Also, remember that the main metro areas like Portland and Seattle have great programs but outlying cities don't take kindly to giving people what they perceive as "handouts". So, if you do end up here, stick to the larger populated cities.
znxss6,j0korbp,,Florida is NOT it either, I'm looking forward to moving to Colorado tbh, I know I know, " we don't want you here "  well too bad, my life not yours adapt or get lost with no cause, anywho, I've heard Denver is the spot atm ain't nowhere else any better .
znxss6,j0jyvbn,,FL is a GIANT no-no, but, if you can get away w it, it's pretty cool.  I hate FL btw, so...
znxss6,,j0jzc7n,What makes it such a bad place to be for homeless people?.
znxss6,,j0k1dqy,90% of the "residential" area is governed by an HOA. By "residential" i mean any land under contract, whether developed or not. It's the cheapest way for the local and state govt to maintain the land. It also means there's lots of restrictive laws, and despite the homeless population there, it's virtually illegal to be so. If you have a job and you're homeless and you piss off a coworker, they can report you for vagrancy where they know you sleep, which will get you 24hrs in custody. That's a no-call/no-show, because you're one call can only be to your lawyer, or a family member. Not your employer.  Most employers are sympathetic, but keep missing one day a week because you're getting picked up every Monday or Tuesday, or worse, the night before your busy day, and they'll be forced to fire you.  Almost every employment agency has vacancies for oil rigs. Especially for men. FL loves single moms and dependent women.
znxss6,,j0k5xc5,Thank you. Very interesting but also sad and pathetic that you automatically become a "criminal vagrant" the minute you have below a certain amount of money. I mean, what are you supposed to do...walk around at all times with a plainly visible money clip containing a fat wad of hundreds just so you can prove your "innocence"?. Crazy.
znxss6,j0m1wba,,Pick something with a good warm climate, better to be too hot in the summer then go through one winter freezing with tons of snow.
znxss6,j0maz6q,,San Francisco is the best
znxss6,j0n0o7o,,I saw a video of a guy in San Francisco saying they give $600 in general relief if you‚Äôre homeless. But if you do decide to go there, you‚Äôre probably going to be homeless forever unless you land some tech job. My friends live in Indiana and they work at a gas station and pay rent on that. That‚Äôs where you want to live.
znxss6,j0o9azt,,Manalapan, Florida
znxss6,j19ecn3,,Have you applied for disability? Because while housing first initiatives focus on putting people in housing before asking them to work or get drug treatment or whatever, they still ask that. They pay for x amount of time according to what I've read, and then the person is expected to get themselves going enough to at least pay for a subsidized apartment.
znxss6,j2ymyie,,The answers about ‚Äúbest‚Äù being subjective are so dumb. Obviously the best place to be homeless is going to be the best place to get out of homelessness. Why would anyone even ask on the internet about the best place to stay homeless, as if it‚Äôs a life style. The only reason to ask people online is that you want to survive.  I‚Äôm also looking for the best place to be homeless. I live with my mom in my car that doesn‚Äôt stay warm enough to live in the Midwest. I need to find somewhere I can survive and build my life up as fast as possible. Work camps/housing included jobs are not going to work unless both me and my mom can get in at the same time. Any suggestions?
znrv8j,j0j7dh1,,I have survived up to negative 10¬∞ below zero in my van. Basically I had a sleeping bag with two fleece blankets and a large heavy duty comforter. I also found a California king size comforter that I stretched around the van like a tent and I started my van every 4 to 5 hours to keep warm but for the most part even when I fell into a deep sleep I was okay. The key is to maintain your warmth.   For those of us that don't have vehicles I've seen people successfully use water resistant sleeping bags and put the comforter inside with them it looks puffy and uncomfortable but it does the job. Mind you you have to wear some clothing as well I had a hoodie cotton pants and socks as long as with the beanie.    Thrift shops are your friend it saved my behind so many times.
znrv8j,,j0k5lqj,Thats good advice. The more you have around you is better.
znrv8j,j0j7740,,We have warming shelters here. These are not normal homeless shelters they are just buildings that allow anyone in all night 7pm - 7am when it drops below 35 degrees outside. It‚Äôs only warmed to 50 degrees or 60, but it‚Äôs warm. Some have bunks and blankets and others are byob.
znrv8j,,j0k5yh6,Yes, they do!
znrv8j,j0iyago,,Scarves are super helpful. I didn't realize how much of a difference they made till trying them.

znrv8j,,j0klyok,Can you get a sub zero sleeping bag?
znrv8j,,j0mhsct,I think so. Most of the thicker ones claim to keep you warm when weather turns super cold. Blankets on a sleeping bag sounds like a good idea to me.
znrv8j,,j0onvcs,I hope you buy one in advance of the incoming weather
znrv8j,,j0k5vbw,If it gets too bad, you go find yourself a place to crash for a while to get warm. Don't stay out in that stuff!!!!!! They open up warming centers everywhere when the weather gets too cold!
znrv8j,j0km464,,It's going to be as low as 20 this week in the DFW area. I'm surprised there are not more warming stations or emergency overnight shelter advertised.
znrv8j,j0kytk4,,I slept in my car with a broken window, i felt the full force of the cold. Really i had a good ass sleeping bag that's rated 0f and i put a bunch of hand warmer inside my sleeping bags. This was 5 years ago, not homeless no more, was the definition of a starving artist till i got into forex trading. Don't major in art lmao
znrv8j,j0l8z5c,,Just looked at next week's forecast and found out
znrv8j,j0jddej,,It's brutal here in California...a state not known for cold winters (but it does rain pretty bad). Six people have frozen to death in the past four days in the south bay alone. They're finding more bodies everyday. Stay safe everyone, if you need it, find a warming center. If you're sleeping on the ground, lay down at least 4 layers of cardboard to keep the ground from sapping your heat, and please remember to eat plenty. Food is the fuel for the body's furnace, eat well, sleep warm.
znrv8j,j0iwutx,,Laast night was the coldest all year.  Wind blew all day today.  It's going to get serious this weekend.

znrv8j,,j0k65tx,maybe way on up north. North Carolina Smoky Mountain Tops might be white. Not further south. I bet the Floridians are going to be screaming if the temps go toward 40 degrees or lower.
znrv8j,j0jj748,,If you're in Dallas, the Oak Lawn Methodist Church lets people inside when the temperature gets into the 30s. They welcome the LGBTQ community.  Several other churches in the area, including (I think) First Presbyterian downtown open, too. I'm just not sure when.

znpug1,,j0l6dix,Okay, calm down Wyatt Earp. Not everyone on the street is out for blood and capable of murder. They're probably all in on this, thinking that he's an easy mark. If you didn't get that card directly from me, then it's not my problem. You're not getting a dime from me - take it up with the dude who directly sold you the card.
znpug1,,j0uu1ma,I was thinking they were all in on it too. Other than the card dynamic, sounds like a pretty classic shakedown scheme using a compromised middleman. Maybe not the oldest trick in the book, but still in the first chapter. OP needs to do some analysis on the threat level posed by each of the individuals and OP's ability to mitigate that.
znpug1,j0izukk,,Are you in a town big enough that you could move to a different location/ use a different shelter? Even if you can pull the money together it's going to take a minute and you can't live in fear.
znpug1,j0jkdlx,,If they have someone money and they took off with it and you didn't even know that's not on you lol. I'd say fuck them should have gave you money not some random person.
znpug1,j0jaz85,,They probably spent the money on drugs. You did the right thing. It's a dog eat dog world.   You can't do anything unless they do something but the shelter should help you stay safe. Women on the streets who get that police reputation, trust me they are protecting themselves from people like them. Stay safe
znpug1,,j0k0hji,>It's a dog eat dog world.  It's a man eat man world, more specifically. We're men not dogs.

znpug1,,j0k1mhs,I mean I wish they'd realize their obsessions are gay and just put me out of their mind. I've exited the sex part but my life is highly influenced by them. It sucks living like this tbh. But man do gangs know how to get people isolated lol
znpug1,j0jslao,,Could this whole thing be a setup/scam against you ? Kinda sounds like one
znpug1,j0jrsb4,,I like the humility and honesty here‚Ä¶thanks for sharing your mistakes.  Do better next time okay.
znpug1,j0kb49u,,While it can't be promised, chances are these are empty threats. It sounds like someone stupid got fucked over and now you're being threatened because you appear to be an easy target (could be just because you're a woman by yourself - i think - while dude missing money is a man).   Usually when people are serious about messing you up over money, it's not going to be this small of an amount, it's not going to be food stamps, and you aren't going to get this many threats. Generally people who are serious will maybe tell you once or twice if they think you'll cough up money, but after that, you're getting got. It seems like they know you don't have the money in cash, so they just want the food stamps. Very few people are going to be willing to commit the crime of severely injuring you over some food stamps. Nobody wants to go to prison for that.   I could be reading the situation completely wrong, but I don't think you need to be TOO worried about these people. Take precautions, you know, don't let them catch you alone and corner you, maybe some pepper spray is a good idea.  I can't make promises, like I said, but I think this is going to amount to a lesson learned about trusting new sketchy strangers for you and not much more.
znpug1,j0iiot7,,Hate to say it - you're screwed either way. If you admit what you've done, it's a crime and you're going to lose benefits now and for the future. If you don't admit what you did, then you should leave town for your own safety.
znpug1,,j0jmj2g,I second that, I‚Äôd leave town
znpug1,j0iyxmz,,I wouldn't even say selling your stamps was the wrong decision here. I mean sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive.  Where you went wrong was was trusting this guy to handle it for you. Now you're the one who got fucked over.  The only thing you can really do is wait for the replacement card and pay the people who are owed and watch who you trust.    Good luck.
znpug1,j0kgxml,,You look like a mark. You are on the streets, this aint a game. Dude did not take off, he is still around. You are still around, people are lying. If they murder you over food, they were gonna murder you anyhow. If they did not hand the money to you, they know it's not your fault. I doubt they even handed him any money. Stop being weak. Tell them to fuck themselves. If they were serious, they would have already fucked you up. They are just vultures looking for scraps. You are living the fucking life, there is no way out. You must rise up and defeat all of your fears of you ever want to stop being homeless. They are bullying you, and paying them or giving them your food sure as hell is not going to make it go away, in fact, if you don't hold your ground, they will do this for a longer period of time. Once they see you as a food or money source, they will keep coming back. It is far, far more dangerous to give them anything, than to be hard now. Time to realize life ain't a game. Man the fuck up, and do your best. But Do Not under any circumstances give them anything easily just because you think it's easier or safer. I personally like to remind people in your position, that no matter how tough someone is, their neck is still soft, and if attacked, it will be self defense. Keep that in mind.
znpug1,j0iiuuu,,I'll spare you the lecture about shoulda known better. But aside from that *you* are the problem in this equation, you do understand that right? He sold the foodstamps to someone who now, because you backed out, is still owed. So what's the confusion? Pay them, hold up your end of the bargain. I'd be fucking passed too.
znpug1,,j0ikjvy,I don't exactly disagree, but the guy disappeared with the money. Why they would give him the money first is beyond me. But I'm going to follow through because that is the only option realistically.
znpug1,,j0jihbj,Maybe no money was exchanged at all and they are working together to get something from you for nothing. You are assuming there was an exchange. They all could be liars
znpug1,,j0jsnqe,That‚Äôs what I think

znpug1,,j0ijf7f,this is the correct answer^^^
znpug1,j0kj48i,,leave town  unless you want to catch a felony charge for the unauthorized food stamp fraudulent scheme  I've seen others do this when I was in a shelter  Trust me,  get out of town and soon  People lose lives hustling food stamps
znpug1,j0jw5yh,,Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I know it‚Äôs not what you want to hear but it‚Äôs the truth. Pay up or look behind your shoulder for a couple of years.

znpug1,j0jzvr3,,>Just don't be a dumbass like me folks.  A person cannot be a dumbass. While certain actions may be dumb, people cannot be dumbasses  "A person cannot be illegal. While certain actions may be criminal, or illegal, people cannot be illegal"
zn5al1,j0fdll7,,That‚Äôs a thoughtful gift for them. I think many would take that gift in a heartbeat.
zn5al1,j0lp5na,,People would love it.  It just wouldn't do the job everyone thinks.  There is a fundamental difference many people can't see.  Homed individuals go out into the cold where a hand warmer would be useful... and then go back inside to actually get warm when their time outside is finished.  That is the target customer base for an item like that.  A similar item would be the heated cushions you can bring to sporting events.  A portable, heated pad like that sounds like it would be a great idea for someone who spends a lot of time in the cold.  That fundamental difference is... spending a lot of time in the cold, versus spending virtually ALL of one's time in the cold.  If one's default location is a cold one, where there is no finding of a warm place to spend hours... the problem becomes one of heating the chest, not the hands.  Warm hands feels nice... sure.  Feet need warmth too.  And noses, and ears, etc.  A box of disposable one-time use handwarmers are better for THIS kind of situation, only because you can use multiple packs at a time, in different locations simultaneously.. one in each shoe, one for each hand, maybe a couple in some shirt pockets... maybe a pair at your lower back if you are sitting or laying down.  Then, you've got heat at those extremities and body points for 6-10 hours at a time.  The down side, is how many of those packs you go through at one time.  Someone relatively recently posted about a heated vest that they saw on sale, from a company that makes expensive heated clothing.  The placement of the heating elements in the pants and jackets were great... the expected battery life was obviously only meant for recreational use of a couple of hours at a time before needing to be recharged.  Like.. Ski Clothing, version 2.0.  Same kind of stuff would be great for the homeless in the cold, if the battery life lasted 4 to 6 times longer.  And if the gear used replaceable batteries.  Using custom soft Li-On packs means when they no longer hold a charge, you throw the clothes away.  Sure, soft Li-On packs can be any shape the manufacturer needs, while staying slim.. think the batteries in phones and tablets.  It just doesn't do a homeless person any good when the $300-$600 electric outfit they wear for the winter, only lasts for that one winter at most.  Again.  People will love getting them.  They will be grateful.  Just remember.... when you've been cold for 14-18 hours, and you are trying to sleep for the night to make it to the morning where you can get warm for a while, only having that one rectangle of heat might end up being more frustrating than comforting.  When it has been a while, and there's still more cold ahead, you can't seem to find the right place to put the handwarmer and you spend more time awake moving it around than you do sleeping with it in the right spot... because there isn't one right spot.  If they aren't too expensive... maybe give them out in pairs (one for each armpit, or one for the chest and one between the thighs)?  Maybe include a few $3 Emergency Thermal Blankets (from the camping section in Walmart) as well?
zn5al1,,j0o07u6,Yes I am aware of that as an issue as I just finally worked my way back to an apartment but have been putting one in my bra as that is a spot where it radiates through my body and was wondering if others would find it useful.
zn5al1,j0hxge7,,Yes, but always ask first and don't mess with crack heads
zn5al1,j0h5nrm,,That would be awesome!
zn3ijh,j0eshk0,,Food.  No one hands out food.  A Walmart or DoorDash gift card goes a long way.  Physical or digital.
zn3ijh,,j0f028t,What types of foods? I think one time another group handed out bagged chips/crackers/bars and waters‚Ä¶What else? What is everyone overlooking? I do like the idea of gift cards for food/diners etc for fresh meals
zn3ijh,,j0f1tpa,Just count calories.  Think 2000 calories in a day.  What can you pack in a bag that comes up to 2000 calories?  Pro tip:  It's not a peunut butter sandwich, bag of chips, crackers, and an energy bar.  Think meat sandwiches. Turkey, ham, chicken, and tuna..  This time of the year sandwiches can be stored for a least a day.  Add chips and things from there.  And don't forget about gift cards.  Good choices are your local grocery stores, Walmart, and DoorDash.  A decent amount is $10-$20 a person.  For those of us that have the ability to cook, $20 can be stretched almost a week.
zn3ijh,,j0f3gsd,Those are great ideas. What about tuna packets, or canned meats? What about providing small coolers or insulated bags to hold things like sandwiches etc? Where we are our winter can be milder and have stretches of days in the 50‚Äôs leading meats and cheeses to spoil‚Ä¶?
zn3ijh,,j0f57iv,Those tuna packs are cheap, come in many delicious flavors, and can be eaten by themselves.  They are also a great source of protein.  Add some crackers, a few packs of Mayo,  and a few slices of high protein bread like wholegrain.  And you get a protein count up to 28 grams a sandwich.  I wouldn't worry about coolers or anything that isn't disposable.  As long as the food is made for just a day, it should hold up just fine using plastic Baggies and brown paper bags while inside of a backpack.
zn3ijh,j0evm85,,There is a bag we made up at our church once. Bottled water, toothpaste/brush and rinse, socks, a wash cloth and some snacks as I recall.
zn3ijh,,j0ezuaa,Yes, we did that as well. But it‚Äôs so easy to overlook items that may be needed and unthought of. Especially in winter months!
zn3ijh,j0ewq8t,,Wet wipes. Huggies makes some that are 99% water. Also, some way to do laundry. Some laundromats have a card you can load with money. Being fed and clean can do wonders for how you feel out here. Thanks for helping!

zn0x4u,,j0ertqh,I'm not in a major metropolitan area, I don't want to say homelessness isn't a big issue here but it's not like it is in a lot cities. I'm also lucky to live in area where the residents genuinely care about people, this shelter here is funded completely by local donors. They also have great programs here to help people get out of this trap.
zn0x4u,,j0f60wz,if you're comfortable, can you please dm me where this is?
zn0x4u,,j0tecnf,I sure could have used ALL of that, wish I knew a place like that -- I'm living with a sibling who is so horrible I feel like homeless is almost better but there are no programs here at all
zn0x4u,j0gck6a,,There are a few factors that may "trap" people into homelessness, one is purely biological, like sleeping/eating little or bad, "looking homeless" as in wardrobe and perhaps some hair management, chronic illness and "job market mismatch", you might be too brown for a job, or too uneducated, or overqualified etc. There's no cure for some of that, but for the rest a good shelter should be all one needs. Let's not forget that after all the great and not so great wars, including Ukraine, we're all coming out of the shelters! By the way, I do find ridiculous that we're in the space age and still don't have shelters, fucking shelters, for the people, but we're building space stations and moon stations and Mars colonies. Whatever!
zn0cuu,j0f8grw,,   In the case of homeless folks, telling them that sugar, coffee, escapism, much less actual drugs, makes it seem like you are coming from a place of privilege and talking down to them.      For example, if someone gets some hot coffee with a good dose of cream and sugar in it, that‚Äôs not ‚Äúsomething they should avoid.‚Äù  That‚Äôs something that could keep them going all morning.  A lot of the homeless have to eat whatever.  I‚Äôd do some more research from their point of view.   Best wishes.
zn0cuu,,j1fj876,I said drugs is overdosing. I'm not sure what your talking about, cause I never put down the use of ANY substances.
zn0cuu,,j1fp95n,  You included ‚Äúescapism, carbs, sugar, day-dreaming‚Äù on your description of ‚Äúover-dosing,‚Äù unless you clarify your original post.
zn0cuu,j0ihrm5,,In honesty this framing doesn‚Äôt sound like a practice grounded in empathy and it sounds potentially stigmatising to individuals experiencing homelessness who are typically facing a variety of challenges that resulted in losing their housing. Rarely is addiction the cause of homelessness. Millions of Americans are addicted to coffee, sugar, alcohol, and they enjoy those indulgences in their homes. The rising cost of housing is the number one cause of homelessness.
zn0cuu,,j1fjn9f,The reason I'm "going after homeless people" in particular, is cause we have hella time. I'll admit, I'm actually "going after" homeless people on the street who don't have jobs, cause they've got time. Is that bad?? It just sounds like a resource that they have plenty of, and potentially would like to do more with. Does that make sense??? I guess I'm not the best at explaining things, or maybe it's that you're just thinking with your Ass.umptions???
zn0cuu,,j1frtyl,You may have replied to the wrong person based on your quote. But just because people experiencing homelessness ‚Äúhave time on their hands,‚Äù in your perspective, is not a good enough reason to experiment with half baked ideas that blame them for systemic failures and are not even based in the science of addiction.
zn0cuu,j0e4k7o,,I'd just make sure to listen to them and find out what they want above anything else.
zn0cuu,,j1fk4cq,I am them. I'm listening to myself above anything else. Does that fit your critieria? I just wanna promote and make a space for meditation. We'll discuss, as a group, whoever wants to, what they understand meditation to be. I think there's many different ways of approaching it, in terms of technique, and many ways of thinking about it. This will be an open discussion. I'm open to others leading the group at times, personally I'd rather not, but if no-one else is, then I might as well. Does this sound okay to you, or do you still think there's problems, or a lording over, or something??
zmyby6,j0e78vg,,Extra proteins always good. Extra protein Boosts/Ensures have a long shelf life,lots of vitamins and minerals and are pretty darned tasty(maybe just find out his fav flavour. Protein bars are also good and keep forever. That's very sweet of you,what your doing.

zmyby6,j0gywat,,Trail mix with dried fruits instead of candies. Some canned foods can be heated easily, but that depends on how well they're set up. The most useful things I have gotten lately are water jugs. I keep one for cold water and one for boiled water. So at least I can make ramen, oatmeal, hot chocolate or coffee. Potted meat has 14g protein, dollar store items like summer sausage, i think those are 7-8g fatty proteins.
zmyby6,j0dw78x,,In the slim case you're not a troll.  Please stop judging him because he is physically fit and has a stove.  He is still "truly homeless" or however you put it.  Give the man some real food and move on to the next person.
zmyby6,,j0dz29s,Oh, I'm unsure how I'm coming across as a troll, but based on your reaponse, I definitely misrepresented what happened.  We definitely still gave him food. But i'm wanting to go out and buy him some stuff out of my pocket to give him as *extra* to what we already give.   To clarify as well, he does not have access to a stove, as he lives out of his car.   We help people who are low income and have a stove, car, etc and also those who have absolutely nothing, so there's no judgement going on. I'm just looking for the best way to help him given his lack of resources. I don't want to give him something that he can't use and then it just makes him feel worse about his situation, you know?  I edited my main post a bit for clarity.
zmyby6,,j0dze65,I got it.  Sorry for the misinterpreted response.

zmelsk,j0axfwv,,You aren't going to die unless you give up. Millions of homeless people are alive and well right now to one degree or another.  What do you do? Prioritize staying alive. I assume here that you have no dollars to your name...  #### WATER:  Get water. Even if you gotta stick your face in the bathroom sink and drink. Drink till you're full-- and find a container to fill. Check all the trash cans for empty bottles with screw-on tops. Trashy and dirty, yes. But you need to be able to carry water somehow to avoid future dehydration.  #### SLEEP.  2.1. Is it above freezing outside??? If so...  You need to crash for a few hours. Don't go to a bus stop or anywhere where people would regularly walk by at night. Find a dark corner somewhere. Under a tree, or in some bushes, or with your back to a chain-link fence. If you can scrounge up some cardboard and/or a blanket, that'll make things way more comfortable. Cover yourself with what you've got, and get something under you too for insulation. Cardboard sheets are magic.  2.2 Is it freezing temps outside?  Stay inside. If this wallmart has a subway/starbucks or whatever attached, sit around there until day time. If there isn't anything like that, you could probably lay out in a bathroom stall... either of these options are likely to lead to an encounter with employees, possibly followed by an encounter with a cop. Be polite, be honest-- explain your situation and ask those employees and/or the Officer for help.  #### Your near future...  Keep calling those shelters. Carry water. Keep your device charged. Figure out what you need to sleep comfortably: tent? Blankets? Giant puffy coat? Do you prefer darkness and bushes? Maybe a well-lit doorway with a camera? Sometimes people are less likely to start shit if you point out that they're being filmed. Figure out how to get food, one way or another.

zmelsk,,j0bva3s,Respect. I spent many years hitchhiking and hopping fright trains around the country, which involved being homeless by choice. We called cardboard the thousand mile mattress. It really makes a difference.
zmelsk,j0azm4o,,Then go somewhere better. Use your feet if you have to but get to a better place with better resources for the homeless. It might just save your life if you do. I've been where you are and it took me half a decade to get out but it is possible.   Nothing worked for me till I got into the system and started working it from within. As horrible as shelters are they're the first stepping stone for a lot of homeless people towards a better life.   It is brutally hard the life you are living now but if you can't find help where you are then the best thing you can do is get yourself to someplace better to work from. You CAN survive this but you have to learn to think outside the box and to be your own best advocate.   Coming back to NYC probably saved my life. If I had become homeless where I used to live I'd have been in pretty much the same situation. No real resources and a horrible climate most of the year besides that probably would have literally killed me given my health issues.   NYC has a pretty horrible shelter system and the social workers and that they are slow to provide real help. It was supremely discouraging and frustrating at times. But it got me healthcare. The system supported me till I got disability and it got me housed again.   For that I am truly grateful and you will never hear me dissing NYC because of that. I am literally alive today because NYC had the resources available for me to get help and get out. None of it would ever have happened where I used to live. I'd have likely died of neglect, depression, and chronic illness long before now.   Instead I'm living in a tiny studio in Manhattan and doing mostly okay and counting my blessings not my hardships.   You have to get to someplace where you can get real help. That's the first big step for you towards getting out. You can do it.  This is but a season in your life and it's a bad one but eventually it will pass. It doesn't have to be the end unless you let it be.   Been there, done that, and believe me I know. There were lots of days where I thought I couldn't endure one more minute of the constant indignities and the fight for survival. I just wanted to lay down my head and die, but then I almost did and it led me into the system and that ironically saved my life and led to a better one.   There are other places where you might do better. Find one and get there. Go into the system, work it and get out. It won't be easy but you can do it.   ü§óü§óü§ó
zmelsk,,j0lyxhn,[deleted]
zmelsk,,j0mkc8o,Affordable Housing, a tiny studio, the willingness to live in such a small space, and a lot of pinching pennies otherwise.  I felt I was really lucky to get offered this place and didn't hesitate to take it. Outside of Manhattan I might have had a lot more space but this is an area I know, have lived in before and I can get around fairly easily in even with mobility issues.  There's a lot of good hospitals and health care in Manhattan which is really important for me given my ongoing health issues.   It's not easy even with AH sometimes. Things cost a lot more in the city, especially food. I get really frustrated with that sometimes. I can't afford to buy much here in terms of clothing or other stuff. I end up shopping for used stuff online a lot and I practically kiss the ground in gratitude that I have food stamps or 90% of my budget after paying for my rent and phone/internet would go just to buy food every month. Even with them I spend way too much of my income on food lately.   But the flipside is there are a lot of food pantries, albeit they never seem to have much, and there are active recycling groups where I can sometimes get items I need like used household items and stuff. I got my monitor that way, some picture frames, and a couple of pieces of my furniture that way.   I've got plenty of low cost stuff I can do when I feel up to it like pay as you want museum days, the zoos and that. I've got easy access to things like libraries, community centers and parks. Mass transit is easy enough.   If I go out I don't buy much by way of food or drinks. Except for the rare fast food meal I take food with me instead. I use what little money I have as effectively as possible and I do without a lot of stuff most people take for granted like going out to dinner or going to the theater or cinema.   Things I used to do here when I was young and lived here are just beyond unaffordable now. I don't go to see stage shows or the ballet even though I'd really like to. I can't afford to even going to the 1/2 price tickets place. I do make a point of trying to find low cost stuff that I can do once in a while. If they do free plays in the park or parts of Broadway musicals at Lincoln Center and I feel up to it I will go.   I'm going to window shop at a couple of the holiday markets and to catch the holiday displays at Macy's next week. If I buy a cocoa that will probably set me back $10 so I won't be spending much but I do like to look and take pictures anyway.   It's not easy living here but the good things about living here make it worth the scrimping and doing without a lot of the time.   Plus though crime here is far from non existent I don't worry nearly as much about whether or not I'm going to have a window shot in or about being mugged if I go out early in the evening to grocery shop. If there are drug dealers and gangs operating on my block I don't notice them let alone have to worry about them getting me killed like I did when I was living out in East New York and the seedier part of Bushwick.   Living on the UWS isn't automatically crime-free but it's way better than a lot of areas I've lived in since I came back to New York and I'm very happy to be living here again especially since while finances are tight all round I'm not paying anything like what my more affluent neighbors are paying to live around here.   A regular studio a bit bigger than mine with a proper kitchen in this neighborhood is probably 10x what they take every month for this place. It has it's drawbacks, kitchenette vs kitchen, shower only, no tub, very high prices everywhere, but I don't mind. I just deal because the advantages of living in Manhattan way outweigh the disadvantages for me.   The things I can do once in a while they are priceless to me. Going to a great museum and enjoying fine art? That's a total joy for me. Ditto going to zoos and parks to take pics of animals because I love doing that. I like street photography too and there is no lack of subjects for that here.   Where I used to live all I practically had to photograph were lizards and ducks and the odd feral cat. There were only two small museums in that city and both of them were pretty boring honestly. Here I can walk out my door, go in any direction and I'll find stuff that is inspiring to me.   Even when I was homeless I was doing some of the best photography I've ever done in my life because I was back here. I've gotten away from it the past year and a half but I've decided I'm going to get back to it, starting with that trip to see the holiday markets and the windows and that.   This was why I headed here when I lost almost everything down South. I honestly didn't expect I'd end up back on the UWS in Manhattan. That was a major gift from the Gods but I'm glad I'm here because I have opportunities here I never would have elsewhere.   I came back to NYC to create and to get a life and though the pandemic derailed that a bit I'm still working on that happening.  Affordable? Not so much but being back in Manhattan I wouldn't trade that for anything! All I went through? This is my idea of my Happily Ever After...  üòÅ
zmelsk,j0asy7q,,Is there a Traveller‚Äôs Aid Society office in your city?  What they have done in the past, of course with information that you provide them, is contact a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù member in a different city and they will purchase or offer a discounted bus (Greyhound) ticket to travel to a different city, so you can ‚Äúreunite‚Äù with your family.  They will verify your ‚Äúrelative‚Äù. and how you are ‚Äúrelated‚Äù to them and how your ‚Äúrelative‚Äù will ‚Äúsupport‚Äù you in a a different community.  I only suggest a change of location because maybe there will be more possible opportunities and a better environment for you to succeed/survive compared to the community you currently are living in.  Stay safe and watch your back, especially when resting/sleeping.  You may want to scout out a more remote/isolated place before you try to rest/sleep.  I knew a person who slept in graveyard one night just so they could get some uninterrupted sleep.
zmelsk,j0btlgh,,Listen. You just learn to survive or not. ü§∑  The first time I became actually became hopelessly actually homeless, I just went into survival mode. I had no money, about 5 bags worth of clothes, a pair of steel toed boots, my phone, and a job. I was a 43 or 44 year old woman at the time.   I found a source of free water from a spigot on the side of some factory in the industrial part of town. I found an unsecured electrical outlet as near to the water as possible. Then I found a spot in the woods close to both of those.   I found ways to store water and that allowed me to use lots of water to stay clean. I used probably 5 gallons to bathe with. It's important to stay very clean. I didn't have a tent or anything, I just kinda built things from blankets and branches and all kinds of crazy things at first.  I just kept going to work and staying clean and saving money as I could and just trying my best. Eventually I'd save enough to pay the first week and security deposit for a weekly stay hotel and just keep going until something catastrophic happened again.  You either figure it out or you don't ü§∑
zmelsk,,j0gkr6e,That staying clean part is no joke. Back in August, I thought I was doing a good job at it. I washed my armpits, crotch and feet at least every other day. I still got a fungal infection in my right armpit. It was nasty.

zmelsk,j0ccsr8,,>Anyone ever been to this point , what do I do?  You are in a sub populated with people who have also hit their own respective rock bottoms.  Some, more than once.  Imagine if you hit rock bottom.... and climb back up only to later, find you can hit it again at different depths.  What do you do?  There is a ton of great advice out there, and you've already gotten some of it.  All the advice you are going to get, however... the advice that is useful... is all going to be local to \*YOU\*.  People can suggest sleeping behind dumpsters, or in bushes,or under a bridge.... but none of that matters if you can't find any dumpsters, there are no bushes or hedges that you know of, and your area has no bridges you can remember.  You are the one who now has to become really familiar with the area you are homeless in.  That means exploration.  That means reconnaissance.  It means getting off the sidewalk and behind buildings, or in the tall grass, or in a copse of wood.    It means looking at Google maps.  Where trains and roads meet, sometimes there is a bridge.  Highways have overpasses and elevated on/off ramps.  You can even use Google to let you virtually walk down streets and roads, to get an idea of where buildings with cover \*might\* be.... before you actually walk down those streets.  It is \*ALMOST\* like using Google as your own personal drone, to do most of your scouting for you.  You can use that view to find sections of forest that look dense and are not close to businesses and residences.  >I have called every shelter there is... Nothing is available right now.  You mean... you've called every shelter there is, ***and you've put yourself on their waiting lists***, but none have any space at the moment... right?  You \*DID\* put yourself on their waiting lists?  Why is that important?  Well... first, if, say, there are three shelters in the area, and they all have waiting lists, it is extraordinarily likely that the names on **each** list will almost be the same for **all** three lists.  People who sign up, will sign up with all of them, so they can get into the first one out of all of them, that has the space.  Second... people won't always respond when it is their turn, especially if the list is long and they already found their own solution while they waited.  So getting on a long list doesn't necessarily always mean a long wait.  When a bed opens up, they can cut through half a dozen names on their list looking for the next person who wants it.  You have fallen off a cliff.  Up there, was stability.  Up there, was the life track everyone else seems to be on.  Tunnel vision in your desire and want to get BACK to what you had, makes you think you are in a hole.  But you aren't.  You didn't fall into a hole.  You fell off a cliff.  That means you can stop looking up asking "How do I climb back up this impossible wall?"... and you can look to your left, your right, and behind you instead.  And in this case, I'm not just speaking metaphorically.  You really have to start walking around, looking into places you've never really looked before.  You have to take stock of your surroundings.  Are you in the USA?  Are you aware of what SNAP food stamp benefits are?  Do you know that you can likely sign up for them, online?  If you wonder about things like... how you have no address... you can use things like General Delivery to your closest post office and be honest that you HAVE no street address.  Some online portals actually take the homeless into account, and will accept the nearest intersection as a street address.  But... that is a specific things to look into, it is well detailed in many posted locations on being something you need to do, and it will take time to get them.  What do you do for food now?  There are soup kitchens, food banks, churches to hit up, dumpsters to dive, fast food Chicken places to hit up right after closing (they make food they have to toss at the end of the night more than other fast food places).  Finding these places is going to burn shoe leather, and require exploration.  >Is death the only other option?  Obviously not, since **Exploration of your area is an option**, as I just detailed.  Another option is to LEAVE your area for one with better/more resources.  You have two feet... and if you can't sleep, you can trudge.  Where do you go?  When you search Google for local homeless shelters, what happens when you expand the map to include other towns?  What happens when you search specifically for homeless shelters in those towns?    Sometimes, you might even find luck in smaller towns with only one or two shelters.  I know I did with Jacksonville NC for a while, once upon a time.... small town, one shelter, half-full.  And that doesn't mean trudging to a new town and THEN seeing what is there... it means online searches, phone calls, and THEN trudging to a new place with more and/or better opportunities.  >I was forced to sleep at the bus stop again  Who forced you to sleep there?  Did they use a weapon when they threatened you?  If you want to say that circumstance forced you to sleep there... then you aren't taking responsibility for your CHOICE to sleep there.  You could have chosen to look around for a more secluded place to sleep, but you didn't.  That is not circumstance forcing you to sleep in that spot... it was a choice you justified before you closed your eyes.  You slept at a bus stop before, so you must have some sense from your experience, that this is a safe place to sleep.  That is a MISTAKE to assume, and you have now been reminded of that fact.  You are not going to get ANYWHERE, if you don't learn from your mistakes.  You are not going to LEARN from your mistakes, if you don't acknowledge making them.  You chose to sleep on that bench.  Own that.  If you want to walk into a wooded area, bend a bunch of saplings together, and tie it into a bunch... while they are still in the ground... and then cover the outside with underbrush... you can make yourself a hut.  Not a great one... but that's from the crap on the ground around you in the woods.  You can make a lean-to out of that stuff on the ground.  If you explore, you might find sections of tarp, pieces of linoleum countertop that peeled away from what it was attached to, plywood... all kinds of things that you could use to build that shelter.  But even if you didn't explore and find that stuff, if the forest is big enough, everything will already be there to be able to construct some kind of shelter from the elements.  It isn't rocket science.  Our ancestors did this for eons... tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years.  If you are on the list for shelter space, you are only killing time until you get in.  What do you do?  You take it one day at a time.  You deal with today.  Need a goal?  Find a Salvation Army Administrative office.  They will load you up with supplies/clothes/gear.  Might even have a shelter they can ***transport*** you to.... possibly even local cash assistance.  If it is a long walk to get to it.... well, that's the work you do in exchange for the help you get out of it.
zmelsk,j0an512,,Start making those calls to homeless shelters, resource centers, etc
zmelsk,,j0anid8,I've done that...I give up on that. No shelters are taking new people. I'm on waiting lists
zmelsk,,j0es5x1,I survived by avoiding other homeless concentrations. I find a lot of them will harass you or try to steal from you. Hard to do in the winter. But in the summer months I preferred to work and panhandle in a wealthier town and blend in more. Make friends with people who aren't homeless. Always be in the good books with the people who hang out outside and have money. They can spot you for things and even have a place to hang out or shower and shit. Like who the fuck attacks someone sleeping in a bus shelter? Get the fuck away from those people. They aren't your friends.
zmelsk,,j0eze2o,I just wanted to piggyback on this reply to agree with keeping to yourself. You need all your energy to concentrate on getting yourself through this and while throwing in with a bunch of other homeless people seems like a logical step, it rarely works out. There is too much drama and theft and backstabbing. In my opinion it's much better to be alone and just always quietly aware of your surroundings.   Also, always be looking for a better spot. Keep it moving. You learn as you go and get smarter every day.  Keep your chin up. It gets better. ü§ó
zmelsk,,j0b7m2p,Have you tried churches in your area?  BTW: Your nickname is interesting. Jesus is also called the Word. So maybe you can find help from Him.

zmelsk,j0b02hd,,A lot of people here are rock bottom but we never give up. You got to ask yourself,  what is your goal? Make a reasonable goal and start planning small steps towards that goal. Without a goal you will forever wander around homeless, unless someone miraculously helps you but you got to help yourself. Reality is hard

There's some silly little expression I remember from the Hare Krishna, but it can be found in other philosophies too: time, place, circumstance.

zmdwwc,j0bu996,,Getting in is tough.  Sure you can sleep there, as long as you can sleep in a chair with the lights on. Food is the toughest part. It is crazy expensive in an airport.
zmdwwc,j0cir0o,,After seeing your response to someone else who mentioned The Terminal, the movie with Tom Hanks that was [based on a true story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehran_Karimi_Nasseri), you got inspired, didn't you?  That guy lived in that airport for 18 years.  The problem would be, all the people that work at an airport.  ALL of them.  Well... that would be one of the problems.  People notice what stands out.  People notice patterns, and breaks in patterns.  At airports, employees are used to seeing the faceless, ever-changing crowd.  That's the normal pattern.  When those faces start to stand out as being familiar, IE a break in the pattern,, there are only specific reasons why they would be familiar.  Like... frequent business travelers, or delivery vendors, or other people who work at the airport in some capacity, etc.  So.. a familiar face, without a reason to be at the airport, stands out.  Combine that, with a heightened sense of security, since at least 9-11.  Airports are loaded with cameras, and people being paid to make sure they don't accidentally miss something on those camera monitors.  Even smaller airports have more security now than ever before.  I'd guess that you'd have about a week, tops.  By then, someone would have noticed you always being around and not working anywhere, and they would have approached you.  By "they", I mean security, because the person who actually noticed you would have notified them.  This is an airport; they aren't likely to favor casual encounters over something more official.  As to whether or not you'd be put into some kind of Airport Jail.... are you are foreign national, or a citizen?  If you live here, and are just being homeless at the airport, they'd call the cops and pass the buck onto the locals.  If they wanted to be dicks, they'd call the feds and pull some kind of "suspected terrorist" bullshit.... just because it is an ***airport***, and anyone hanging around is likely suspicious and up to no good.  The feds take airports kind of seriously... they use them constantly and like to feel safe.  Kind of seriously.. I mean, they cut corners al the time.  Still though, drawing negative attention in an airport really sticks to a person, you know?  Like... microscope up the rectum, kind of negative attention.  Like, 15 second national news blip sort of negative attention (like a Karen getting ejected from a plane, etc)  I don't see how the benefits outweigh the potential costs.
zmdwwc,,j0et870,Unless you got a job at the airport. You could have a perpetual excuse for being there and if they see you sleeping in a chair they just think you're napping on your break. Which is kinda true because it's just one long break in between your next shift.
zmdwwc,,j0fgd9a,It would likely have to be a well thought out plan.  Like.. it has to be a job at the airport itself, like in maintenance for the broadest access.  You would have to explore the airport extensively, especially all the allowed parking, and you would need a cheap vehicle asap.  You would have to spend some time appearing to leave, and this could be accomplished by sleeping in the vehicle in the least patrolled parking areas.  That way there would actually be times you weren't around.
zmdwwc,,j0w39h4,By a time you'd even have enough for rent.
zmdwwc,,j0dq0v6,This was a whole lotta text to say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd last a week, tops‚Äù
zmdwwc,,j0fhmrq,To explain WHY one would only have a week, tops.  There's a difference between just saying something, and explaining something.  As you demonstrate nicely.
zmdwwc,,j1d8v9x,Chill. I said what I said.
zmdwwc,j0crx41,,I live in San Jose, CA and we‚Äôre somewhat unique compared to other large cities in that our airport is basically adjacent to our downtown. When I was homeless I would go there to charge sometimes. The easily accessible public restrooms are nice too, plus you can return luggage carts for quarters, although the cart jockeys will try to get to them first. The great thing about hanging out at the airport is that someone who looks a little tired, a little disheveled, with a bunch of stuff plugged in doesn‚Äôt look out of place. Even though you can‚Äôt go through security without a boarding pass a lot of people who arrive very early for a flight (or if there is a long delay) don‚Äôt pass through security until closer to their departure time, so it‚Äôs not strange to be there.   For best results you shouldn‚Äôt stay in the same location for more than an hour or two. I wouldn‚Äôt want to *sleep* there personally, but that‚Äôs just me.
zmdwwc,j0b4br0,,About to be homeless. Haven't thought of Airport, cheers, I might just as well see what it's like there
zmdwwc,,j0dpu2h,:(
zmdwwc,j0dci3n,,It's kind of hard to stay at airports for long periods of time. When I was the sheriff's deputy back in the day we would notice people who were lurking too long. There's also a certain security features at airports where at the same person keeps popping up you're going to be questioned it's also public info that the majority of airports have facial recognition cameras.  Both plain clothes and regular security. that's not to mention that depending on the lay out of the airport it might not be any place for you to stay since you'll have to go past security.    However, that's not to say when I was homeless and I stayed in the airport most of the security folks after they got to know me left me alone as long as I stayed out the way and kept myself reasonably clean. Now from the time I was a sheriff deputy usually after a while we ignore the homeless folks that we know and identified. We usually give them hints when it's time to move along.
zmdwwc,j0dpt5b,,Depends on how smooth u are n how vigilant they are.
zmdwwc,,j0e24e3,Not really, There's no point playing hide and seek in a modern airport with hundreds of cameras and staff. From my own experience as a traveller and occasional "resident" I'd say there's hardly any legal basis in most parts of the world to remove you from the open parts of an airport. Bona fide travellers may stay in airports two or three days anyway because of flight cancellations and such, and I don't think anyone's counting, though it will become obvious to some staff you're becoming a resident. They'll typically question you, both as a formality and out of boredom. But they won't be able to kick you out on some pretext like bad hygiene without risking having to prove later on that they applied the same standards to other passengers.  So, just to be clear, you can stay at airports for a VERY long time. Caveat: the Covid period has been very weird, and different airports will have different new normals.
zmdwwc,j0f4pqn,,I got kicked out of the Airport in Portland. I noticed other people sleeping behind some seats inside and I was newly homeless. I was only there maybe a couple of hours

zmdwwc,,j0ayrfe,You want to avoid violence of all kinds? Here's some quick " don'ts " to serve as a guideline:  Don't flash things that people consider as valuable. Don't pull out your phone when around sketchy people, don't flash more money at one time than what you need to pay for stuff, don't wear fancy jewelry. Don't step out of public places where you can easily scream for help. Don't follow people to secondary locations. Don't take invitations to get into peoples cars/vans/houses whatever-- anywhere you might get cornered. Don't accept drinks/food from people unless you saw them prepare it. Don't get drunk. Don't do drugs. If someone touches you and you didn't ask for it, you either run away or fight until you can run away, right there without hesitation. Don't hang out with people that are prone to violence, or that do mind altering substances.

zmdwwc,,j7louef,It's still capable, you just have to find a way to get to the front of the airport. I bluffed my way into a shuttle and went near the skyrail entrance where others were charging and sleeping back in October 2022.
zmdwwc,j0ayn8d,,Have you googled up what sorts of assistance are available in your area? Not shelters-- but is there free food, or free gear to be had?

zmdwwc,j0c6nio,,seems like an airport would be kind of tough....from my pespective the airport has two areas of where people wait. One is before the counter, and the other is behind which requires a boarding pass. The area before the counter is where a homeless person would stay, and I cannot help but think they would get noticed fairly soon. Unlike behind the counter(boarding pass area)...people on the outside re rarely there for any real length of time. Thus raising attention sooner.  After 9/11 airport probably not the best place to hang out.

[Greyhound tells you what organizations they support](https://www.greyhound.com/en/discover-greyhound/organizations-we-support), and how they might give out a free ticket.  Are you a runaway going home?  You can get a ticket.  Are you homeless going from one place to another?  No free ride.  Amtrak doesn't provide free fares... unless you are paying for a fare.  There is a free companion fare promo right now.  Amtrak doesn't do emergency free fares.  Airlines don't do emergency fares either (over the age of 2, anyway).  If you are being deported, and flown out of the country, the state department pays that fare... the airline doesn't do it for free.  Death in the family?  If an airline even still does it, it is called a bereavement fare.  Cheaper... not free.  Same as Amtrak.  In fact, Amtrak itself compares their fares to airfare.  Why don't planes and trains provide some kind of emergency assistance fare like that?  Because a bus will do, if it has to be for free... and there are apparently select few reasons why these travel companies will agree that they should carry someone for free.  Let's face it.  People would abuse the hell out of free fares if they could.  You asked about free airfare, just so you could change where you are going to be homeless.  That's definitely reaching for far more than should be available.... your expectations are way too high.  You don't want to Hitch-hike.  Understandable.  You don't want to hop trains.  Understandable.  You don't want to walk or trudge.  You also don't want to go down to the [ManpowerGroup day labor office in Jacksonville FL](https://www.manpowergroupusa.com/manpower/locations/jacksonville), and stand in line until you get work, so you can PURCHASE a bus ticket to San Diego.  I'm not sure I like their page design.  That office is at 9328 Tapestry Park Circle, suite 10.  904-807-9608 is their number.  [Here's a link to the location on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/MANPOWER/@30.2574459,-81.5560467,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e5b86e8cea0e8b:0x121d1c143d48218f!8m2!3d30.2575334!4d-81.5538627).  You also don't want to fly a sign, stating on it that you need bus fare out of Florida.  That alone  might earn you the fare price in a day or two.  People might throw Twenties at you.

Tons of that going on right now, some of which includes housing.  If there is nothing for you where you are, try walking.. not hitch-hiking, not hopping... just walking to the nearest place that does.

zmcn18,,j0gib79,This is true.   I didn‚Äôt word my comment very well. What I was trying to say is that if a person wants to spend a lot of time in more than one state or relocate eventually, then it‚Äôs a good idea to make sure that the amount of tint they get is good in either state. Example: I‚Äôm in NC where the legal amount is 35% but I‚Äôm wanting to go to Pennsylvania for a while and it‚Äôs 70% there, which is a big difference. I don‚Äôt want to pay for tint and then have to take it off and I don‚Äôt want to pay for a ticket so I looked into alternatives. This won‚Äôt apply to everyone, but I had no idea that there were even different tint levels initially. Just throwing it out there in case it‚Äôs helpful to someone who reads this.

zm92du,j09s5xn,,Also homeless in Colorado here. It can get really nasty out there on cold nights. And the weather is going to be pretty damn cold for a while. So if you can gear up, now it's the time.  I have had good luck keeping warm with the following items:  ‚Ä¢ A sleeping pad to cover the ground. This is essential, as if you lay directly on the ground without inadequate layer to protect you, all your heat will drain away through the ground. Incidentally, if you're anywhere near Glendale, I have a spare sleeping pad and a half that need a good home, as I just upgraded mine. In the past, I have gotten away with it simply using layers of cardboard.  ‚Ä¢ A good sleeping bag. Something rated below 32¬∞F/0¬∞C.  ‚Ä¢ A good thick blanket to go over the sleeping bag. A local activist gave me a heavy comforter ‚Äî but any kind of thick or insulated blanket will do.  ‚Ä¢ A tent, tarp, or other windbreak that's also resistant to rain and moisture.  The problem with all of this right now, however, are the sweeps that they've ramped up. This makes it virtually impossible to set up any kind of structure to shelter under, except in some of the larger camps downtown, which are supposed to have a week's notice before a sweep.  Finding a sheltered area, such as under a bridge, is advised, except it's also an obvious place where they are likely to check. There are some bridges that are more secluded, where you could hide up in underneath and not be obvious. Might not even need a tent under there.

I don‚Äôt want to alarm you, but depending on where you are in Colorado and how cold it becomes outside, you or anyone else that is outside has a larger risk of dying due to hypothermia and/or cold exposure.  With that said, I actually spoke to a man the morning after he slept outside in 18 degree F (probably lower with the wind chill) in Colorado.  The man told me he slept in an alley with at-least five or six blankets on top of and around him.  I don‚Äôt know how many more nights he survived outside, but I wouldn‚Äôt do it.  I remember one year reading in news from the large cities in Colorado that almost sixty people without homes died throughout one twelve month period in just one of the large Colorado cities.

This late into winter you would at least need a tent, 0 degree bag, sleeping pad, thermals, boots, etc just to not freeze to death.  And you're still gonna be cold.  Pro tip:  Go down to the sandwich line at Auraria Campus at 11am.  After they finish feeding, they open up their clothing room.  They have the best clothing room in the city.  And for some weird reason they have a lot of sleeping pads.  I don't think homeless people know what they are because no one ever takes them.    Good luck on your journey.

zlh4uv,j05mluv,,Oh my. You're talking about the state with the largest homeless population in the county, over 70 percent of which are unsheltered.  They have people stabilized in shelters with jobs but no apartment because there do not exist enough apartments! You have to make 80 k to be housing secure in California.  Their housing shortage is severe, and their policies for assisting the homeless are a cluster fuck. It is the last place I'd go hoping for any sort of roof over my head.  I'd go to a small town with a shelter but not many homeless.  Like I saw in the news that due to current extraordinary circumstances, Sherman tx shelter was full for the first time ever. I would wager it doesn't stay full. Waiting time a lot less. Cheap housing. Pricey now to them, but nationwide very cheap.
zlh4uv,j05fssb,,It takes a long time to get into permanent housing. Section 8 waitlist is 10 years long [I was fast tracked and got it faster but still took me two years and even with Section 8 I couldn't get an apartment]. Affordable housing has long wait lists, 3+ years. Transitional housing/emergency shelters have long wait lists, multiple weeks or months. There are some shelters with no waitlists, but they require you start lining up at 3pm to get in. They're first come first serve, so if you don't get in you're out of luck. You have to line up literally everyday at 3pm, stand in a line for hours with a bunch of other homeless people. Expect to sleep outside most nights, that's what I had to do.    All of this is for a major city, not sure how small towns are. I expect it to be harder because there's less resources    Edit: oh yeah I forgot, don't take anything valuable to the shelter.

You could stay on someone's property and help out on their farm or in some other capacity for a few hours a day in exchange for room/board and food. The remaining hours are yours to do with as you please.  There's a wwoof subreddit and also a website.
zlh4uv,,j05ykrf,Interesting idea actually...thank you!. I also heard that in Cali they have a service that matches a homeowner with a homeless person. Like a lonely widow who is just wanting some company and maybe someone to help around the house or out in the garden or whatever.
zlh4uv,,j0oryk8,Everywhere in the country there are people who need a caregiver and want to trade a bedroom for it. But significantly more work than helping a bit. It's people who can't afford to pay 15/ hr or whatever the going rate is.https://www.agingcare.com/questions/room-and-board-exchange-of-live-in-care-204406.htm

zlh4uv,j07njov,,California is a *very* large state and most of the things you‚Äôre asking about are done on a local (county or city) level, so it‚Äôs gonna vary wildly. A lot of it relies on luck and being in the right place at the right time, without having any idea what the right place might be. The general public has lost patience and sympathy for us, I have no doubt that feeling will soon be reflected in laws and policies.

Growing up, when we stayed in a motel, I knew families that worked as housekeeping and received discount on rent (the owner was a great person and felt bad for those who fell on hard times). Also, fastfood will hire 3 of you pretty quickly for decent pay.

zlewio,j0560gn,,They're making you get a work permit? The laws must have changed over the decades but if you were under the age of 15 you needed a work permit , that's at least when I was younger. A time when job applications were walk ins on paper not online
zlewio,,j057u2w,From what I know from calling local chains and businesses and my school counselor, anyone under 18 needs it in San Diego California
zlewio,,j0agftj,Usually you get the permit from a school district. Which begs the point, you guys really just need to be in school. I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to your childhood. Making the right adult ally can help you all out of this mess. I‚Äôd suggest trying to find latinx or lgbtq organizations if they exist nearby-they will probably have somewhere safer like a group home, or a shelter. Once you have a stable housing, they can help with work and education for the youngest. Every day you guys aren‚Äôt in school till you‚Äôre 18 leaves you behind, and you‚Äôll have to get a ged eventually.   If you can go to school, you can get your permit and make money.   Finding work under the table is possible l, just ask around at hotels and cheap restaurants. I‚Äôm a corporate recruiter and the permit might be necessary not sure though
zlewio,j069do2,,What about job corps for some of you guys? It at least gives you somewhere to live. And shit I keep hearing about busses full of migrants being shipped up to NYC and then they're given a place to stay and all kinds of resources, idk if it's feasible to get to NYC but idk I'd at least look into it. I can't even imagine how much this must suck, but you guys gotta be your own biggest advocates, call literally everywhere- any and all churches in the area, any and all charity organizations, call legal aid for whatever county you're in and see if they can help get the eviction pushed back, shit I'd even try calling the county sheriff's landlord tenant department just to make sure everything about the eviction is going by the book.

zlewio,,j0c6f7b,I think it‚Äôs a political maneuver since their case has been publicized so heavily. It‚Äôs true that undocumented immigrants are safe from deportation in NY, but just going there from California won‚Äôt give them access to resources.

We‚Äôd like to think this would never happen, but‚Ä¶I question whether it‚Äôs happened before.  Perhaps, if contacts can be made first at youth shelters‚Ä¶utilizing available social workers at these shelters to help ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù at each step just to ensure no one gets lost through any cracks in the systems?  I still agree with reaching out‚Ä¶just like covering all angles and having a backup and then a backup and another to keep things in check.
zlewio,,j09dd50,You can always make contact with a social worker and explain the situation and see what your options are (without having them come in just in case anything does go down) I'm sorry this happened.

zkyrew,j03qfh1,,part of the problem with affordable housing is that it's not affordable to build - especially in the large cities where a lot of jobs are, the real estate is worth a lot, construction prices are very high, etc... and in the end you're just going to have Projects - high crime low value real estate that actively devalues the surrounding property.  the Federal government has to build the housing, no one else is going to do it.  unless it's an election year, the politicians won't even consider it.
zkyrew,,j05p2vm,? There are tax credit apartments.
zkym9j,j02yua9,,Yes, carried them all the time when homeless. Kept stuff dry, including me. In a pinch it can make for a quick porta potty.
zkym9j,,j07wl3i,[removed]
zkym9j,,j083n5j,Late night when I was homeless finding a toilet open was nigh on impossible in NYC. They were deliberately closing all the transit ones from midnight to six am. Being a woman it was a lot harder to just go outside and do my business like men do. I am rather shy about showing my naked ass in public and not physically able to hold it for too long because of a medical thing.   When I have to go I have to GO. It's either that or soil myself.  So I'd find someplace dark where I could hide from view, like behind bushes or under closed stairs or use a blanket as a tent. I'd put a pet pad in the bottom of a plastic bag, go in that, then dispose of it.  Those bags saved me from a ton of embarrassment during emergencies at the time and they kept me, my cat and my stuff dry when it rained besides.  Mind you they have to be decent brand name trash bags, not cheapie ones that suck and will leak. I never begrudged the $$$ I had to spend on those and when I could get a few from someone I was very grateful indeed.  Good plastic bags they can make a tarp, an impromptu raincoat, a cover for your stuff and yes, a personal potty....

zkym9j,j055f2s,,Yes definitely, especially the large heavy duty ones.
zkym9j,j05ghav,,in my experience absolutely extremely useful. you can use them to carry stuff, keep stuff dry from rain/snow when hidden away, keep bugs out, a place to put wet boots/shoes while inside a tent, something to eat over while inside a tent, as a toilet in an emergency, to get rid of trash (obviously) and more.
zkym9j,j03j63o,,On the slim chance you're not a troll, I'll give my opinion.  I carry them yes, but I don't think it would be wise to just give out garbage bags to homeless people.  Out of ten people someone will take that as an insult as if you're calling them trash.

I can‚Äôt imagine ever kicking out family if they have nowhere else to go, unless they had to be the worst guest ever. Like is your cousin doing drugs and shitting on her sofas? There‚Äôs always something someone can do to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for their stay. Cleaning the kitchen, bathrooms, floors, doing the dishes, cooking meals, and if they have a bit of means, buying groceries or paying for utilities, etc.. Guests should always actively try to make their hosts‚Äô lives easier with their stay. Even then, they are still indebted, because people want their own space, but what did they do or not do to get kicked out?

You have no idea what kind of person my grandmother is, she's hateful to most people, and I'm better off since I cut her off myself.  Nobody deserves homelessness, but my cousin and his family legit got kicked out because them getting their own housing was "taking too long" and she told them she didn't wanna be a bitch but they had to go.

zkxl98,,j038zp4,I disagree with the " nobosy deserves homelessness" you shoud see the tiktok vidoes of serving evictions for non paying tenants of 12 months and have totally trashed the placed. I am going to say there are 2 sides to every story and your grandma is probably on a low fixed income and probably cant support them anymore. did they work or make any attempt to get out on their own? Even with a light bill not paid the utility company usually takes a deposit but they need to get the bill paid its in her name and if she didnt give permission to grandma to do it then press charges I guess. It sounds like nothing was done about it
zkruly,j037qdb,,Everytime I get sickened by people there's always someone that displays genuine kindness. They're rare but they really do exist. Keeps me going.
zkruly,j01aqw2,,There were a lot of people who treated me like crap when I was homeless but there were also a few people I considered  everyday angels. You have to focus on the good people, not the bad. It's a hard mindset to leave behind, feeling like human trash. Even when you stop being homeless it stays with you for a long while.   I don't think I will ever leave being homeless behind. It caused some fundamental changes in my character, some good, some bad. I don't trust people like I used to and I'm not nearly as kind. I'm far more cynical when it comes to people and their motives that's for sure but I do make an effort not to be too suspicious or nasty and I try not to just assume the worst of people.   I think for me it was a bit different than for some other people. In my life I've always had to deal with people trying to bully me, trying to make me feel bad about myself. Being homeless multiplied that by 100x but since I'd previously experienced it I was able to seperate that bullying from my sense of self.   Being able to do that probably helped me a lot in terms of being able to be stable mentally. I'm not a docile person. I don't sit there and take it when people abuse me. I can't so needless to say that made me very unpopular at times in the shelters where staff and residents both like to do just that.   Being homeless could have turned me into a very angry, horrible person but I simply refused to let that happen. It's a choice. You can either let being homeless beat you up emotionally and define you or you can choose to defy it, get busy, and get yourself out.   Someone I met early in the experience told me that being homeless was a seaon in my life. That it might seem hopeless but that eventually it would be over and real life would begin anew. It was the longest season of my life but in the end I did pass through it and I made it out to a real home and a better life.   You can too but in order to do it you have to own your own life and control how you respond to the abuse. Let the negativity  eat you up emotionally you won't make it out. Defy it and you will.   Never mind what negative people think.   You do for you and you believe in yourself and you'll be far more likely to make it.

zkruly,j04orey,,I focused on being someone I like.  I'm angry at the world for a number of things... and I'd still be angry if I wasn't homeless.  I'm here.  I'm harsh and opinionated, but I try to do what I can, one person at a time.    I don't ask for help, and I don't get disappointed at the lack of it.    I learned to give people leeway before they earn trust.... play out the rope a bit more before I commit to anything.  I learned to ask questions, to determine if kindness is genuine, or hides ulterior motives... basically I learned to insert a buffer of time between me and anything that requires trust, to give me the time to determine if trust is warranted.  I had to learn that... I'm still learning that.  I've learned that whether or not I want to trust, has nothing to do with it, and can actually only cause problems.  I dunno.  Maybe the new caution is a good thing... keep you off the path of homelessness.  Maybe you find a way to help some of the others still on the streets.  I know that today in the USA, being a trusting individual will only lead to trouble.

To not feel kindness and love towards a fellow human especially one at such a disadvantage in their life must be awful. I try not to take it personally either. It's not me personally they are disgusted with its the situation. It could have been any homeless person sitting there and they would have gotten it just the same. Thats how I choose to look at it.   While stripping in my 20s I acquired thick armour. I got used to shitty comments without damaging my self esteem.   People who treat you badly just simply aren't worth giving your time to. They want their words to hurt you. Don't allow it.

It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if I didn‚Äôt have my lil dog with me. It was difficult enough last year losing her sister.

I don't per say hate anyone in active addiction and/or alcoholism but I don't need or want to be on that level anymore where anyone in a program can be a friend as I'll be supportive of their program
zkil9z,j007cun,,Hi, I work at a homeless shelter so I can maybe help a bit. First of all, thank you for offering to help your friend ‚ù§ Some of the items you've mentioned probably wouldn't be allowed to be brought into a shelter - outside pillows and blankets are a bedbug risk, a space heater could be a potential fire hazard, cleaning supplies are provided at the shelter. Some shelters also limit or entirely ban outside food, drink, or toiletries because guests can use them to sneak in drugs or alcohol - it sucks but it is what it is.   Some material things that our guests really appreciate are good quality, sturdy backpacks and shoes, comfortable pajamas, slide on slippers/shower shoes, and always nice hoodies - I swear I get hit up for hoodies at least 5 times a day. Ear buds to block out the noise from others are also super popular.   For her kiddo, how old is he? Look at maybe gifting experiences for her to do with her son that she otherwise might not be able to afford - family shelters usually have tons of toys available. Is there a local trampoline park in her area that they could go to on a rainy day? Indoor pool, Chuck e Cheese, Dave and Busters, a local zoo or amusement park? Something like that would make an amazing gift and wonderful memory for both of them!  Again thank you for supporting your friend - I'm sure just knowing that she has you is a gift in and of itself ‚ù§
zkil9z,,j00d2zq,>Look at maybe gifting experiences for her to do with her son that she otherwise might not be able to afford  This is an amazing idea, I'm 100% doing that right now
zkil9z,,j00ulp2,I don't know about your particular area but here in California there is rampant theft in shelters...my friend burnt out her phone because she kept it under her pillow to keep it from being stolen. Maybe get your friend a pocket or pouch that she can keep under her clothes for any money, or gift cards and credit cards if she has any.  I'm sure that it's pride that keeps your friend saying no to your help, but just being there for her is amazing.
zkil9z,,j01ohbk,When I was homeless I learned real quick to keep my phone on mute and not let anyone know I had it. Someone always wanted to use it or was eyeing it up like they wanted to steal it.
zkil9z,,j01qerd,üíï
zkil9z,,j03baqz,Piggy backing on this as a shelter associate as well, this is the best and most comprehensive answer. There are so many things that are not allowed to be brought in. (Pepper spray being one of them) She may find that she needs things as they come up but the less she has in a shelter, the better. Theft is rampant and the shelter is not liable.   Outlets are limited and mostly reserved for those who require oxygen or use scooter chairs. Think, a weighted blanket as opposed to a heated blanket.   Things I'm asked for the most: shower shoes, ear plugs, hand warmers, socks, razors, bus passes.   Things I see people need the most: headphones, slippers, portable chargers, a bag or suitcase that locks.   I am a huge advocate of gifting experiences and can't recommend it enough. Being in a shelter is mentally exhausting for both residents and staff alike so anything that gets them out of the shelter will help.
zkil9z,,j09791d,>Things I'm asked for the most: shower shoes, ear plugs, hand warmers, socks, razors, bus passes.   >   >Things I see people need the most: headphones, slippers, portable chargers, a bag or suitcase that locks.  I already purchased some slippers for her, to wear inside her room since they have concrete floors. I will be adding shower shoes for her and her son to my amazon cart for her as well as a backpack with lock
zkil9z,izzz4f5,,When you‚Äôre homeless less material items is best. If she doesn‚Äôt need anything I would just give extra towards target or something giftcard that way when something does come up she needs she can get it :)
zkil9z,j00ngcj,,Outside of everything already said I think items that make us feel a little more humanized often get left out but can have a big impact. As someone mentioned less is often better, which means women give up a lot of material items such as makeup, jewelry, nicer lotions and perfumes. I think a small perfume can help someone feel a little more confident and humanized
zkil9z,j00k53z,,A backpack lock, it'll help a lot with storage for irreplacables such as ID or small keepsakes. Some shelters don't have places to keep such things and others ypu wouldn't trust employees with your stuff
zkil9z,,j097c9c,>A backpack lock  I found a backpack with lock on Amazon and ordered it for her! This is a great suggestion

zkil9z,,j00gnd4,She has this already!
zkil9z,j019bvq,,In presuming she has a smartphone, maybe virtual gift cards to make less physical things to keep an eye on, then, especially if you already have some, look into subscriptions you can share with her. And to the very good suggestion of experiences, if there are kids museums or other things in her area, especially if there's something she can enjoy as well, a membership. It may be hard for her right now to want to do things for herself but having the paid for outlet that is already good for her son might help.
zkil9z,,j097nrp,>maybe virtual gift cards to make less physical things to keep an eye on  I love this advice...but I'm worried if I send it to her via email or text, she won't redeem it. I tried sending her a Doordash gift-card and she never redeemed it and I never got charged for it either...so I'm doing physical cards so she is "forced" to take it from me since it's in her hands. She can redeem it with the code and toss the card right away! I plan on texting her this in case she didn't think of it  I will be getting her and her son tickets to the science museum and one of the giftcards is for a movie theater in her area :)   I also got her a backpack with lock, slippers, and will be buying her shower shoes...I think I'll stop there though
zkil9z,j004v6v,,Fanny pack to keep important life documents nearby and safe
zkil9z,,j00uthx,Fanny packs are very easy to steal, something under her clothes would be better. I used to interact with a lot of homeless people and they had their things and any money they had stolen all of the time...üòî

zkil9z,j007fya,,A visa gift card would allow her total control over purchasing. My aunt means we'll obviously but when she used to be able to help, restaurant gift cards were the worst for me because I'd have rather gotten fast food as a cheaper meal treat and had more for something else I needed.

zkil9z,j013ukq,,If she has a car then a prepaid gas card would be wonderful  If she doesn't already have one and cannot get one for free, a bus pass would be great.  Gift card for an experience for her and her son  Good quality backpack that she can put a lock on  Prepaid Visa card so she can pay things like her phone bill. But make sure to get the Visa card from your bank because there are tons of gift card scams from places like Walmart or Target.  Gift card for Supercuts or any kids hair salon   Pay for a few months for Disney Plus. They can watch videos on their phone.   Movie gift certificate for local theater
zkil9z,,j097w9c,Great ideas, thank you. I already spent my limit of what I am comfortable with for the moment but I really like the super cuts idea! I'll save that for her bday or her son's bday!

zk72zc,,izz1yoq,Those are a solid alternative. Maybe even better? You don‚Äôt need running water to use those.
zk72zc,,izzc3u8,I love those. Now that I can't go to the gym anymore because of the pandemic, I noticed that wiping my face everyday reduces the grime that otherwise builds up to the point of being scrapable in the shower every 3 days, prepandemic. They can also help desmell things, and they can help clean "down there". When I worked in food service during the pandemic after my gym first shut down, I would do sponge baths with baby wipes before I went to work.
zk72zc,,j00wzw5,I swore by them when I was homeless.
zk72zc,izz9zwu,,I've been doing my own outreach, I typically keep handwarmers in stock, emergency "space" blankets are great too. Rain ponchos I usually get either donated or I buy every other cycle. Socks, the longer kind is preferred usually, those are little harder to keep up on. Recently had a very generous donation of 12 beanies and pairs of gloves.  Next pay period I'm planning on dropping some serious funds on a bulk order of sleeping bags and fleece blankets as we lack shelter options in my city.   Also some food items that are great to have, protein bars, slim Jim's or small packets of beef jerky, breakfast bars, and instant coffee packets if I can get them.  Pads and tampons are also really useful, as are other travel sized hygiene kits or even small first aid kits.  I go out almost nightly to pass stuff out, but I also have two church's that have free boxes outside their buildings I drop stuff off at, as well as the local low income clinic I myself go to, they're always down to take some handwarmers.
zk72zc,izzvw3h,,Socks, gloves, scarfs, nail clippers, toothbrush/toothpaste, wet wipes or baby wipes, a bottle of water, hand warmers, instant coffee or tea bags or electrolyte packs, daily vitamins packs, tweezers, matches or a lighter
zk72zc,j001dn8,,Others said the big ones but I‚Äôll add Diaper wipes, or even just hand wipes. If you have it in your area - a pass for public transport.
zk72zc,j00c60b,,Tarps
zk72zc,j00on1h,,I‚Äôve done a lot of outreach in my community. Toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, and chapstick were always appreciated. The number one thing requested was socks. White socks specifically. Apparently the dyes of colored socks made them more prone to smell, from what I was told (not 100% if true) but they always appreciate any socks they can get.
zk72zc,j014adh,,Those shake pouches that get hot. Those are wonderful for the winter. They're small enough that you can put them in your pocket or on your chest to hopefully keep colds away or even in your socks.
zk72zc,j01kaf3,,Yes wet wipes are better than soap. Also, water bottles.

zjmgg4,,izwbpf9,Lol! No kidding!
zjmgg4,,izxe0d3,Something like this *does* exist. :)   I just added in an edit since so many people were asking.
zjmgg4,,izxgcrl,I don't think there's anything like that in AZ. There are programs for individuals and families, but limited mainly to women and children, for less than a year. AZ is a screwed up state. HUD usually has an 8yr waiting list, and you have to renew your application every yr and it usually takes a month or more to get through that, and you're limited on when you can start the renewal process, and will be in cue with new applicants. From what I've learned over the years, most states, and the Fed govt, make it extremely difficult to get out of whatever situation one is in, unless they can manage to "pay" their way out, which is getting more and more difficult everyday with rising inflation and changing credit regulations.
zjmgg4,,izxi6nf,So, this does exist in AZ. Specifically, the Northern 5 counties have RRH money (Yavapai, Coconino, Apache, Navajo, and Mohave). Anyone who is literally experiencing homelessness (HUD definition) qualifies even if they do not have income at the time. Believe it or not, the main contract holder in the North is Catholic Charities Community Services. I would suggest reaching out to the Flagstaff or Prescott office. The front desk person in Flagstaff is kind of a nightmare so just ask to talk to the hosuing department. It's limited to folks who live in the northern half of the state but they serve everyone and do not force religion on anyone in any capacity. The other holder of RRH funds that I'm aware of is Flagstaff Shelter Services in Flagstaff.   Flagstaff uses the system called Front Door. This means there are 2 locations where people can do intakes to get access to almost all housing opportunities in town in one place. The other 4 use No Wrong Door, meaning they have multiple providers (housing, mental health, peer support) able to complete intakes into the same system.   All RRH in northern AZ has a budget depending on time of year, spend down, etc. I can say that the average assistance amount per household ends up being around 2k-4k total. Usually this covers deposit, first month's rent,  and potentially partial rent for the next month or so, depending on how much a unit costs. There are lots more details, but that should help someone get started.
zjmgg4,,izxn3ko,They have that in Central AZ, also, but it's not fast, and the assistance provided only helps w about 1mo of rent/utility assistance. If that's all that anyone is talking about, I'm on the wrong thread. What i am talking about is long term stability while an individual or family gets back on their feet. Not a 3mo wait for a month of assistance, or a 12mo-8yr wait for an actual home.
zjmgg4,,izxqf5y,Right. So that program is nationally called Permanent Supportive Housing and Catholic Charities Community Services is the main contractor of that contract as well. The hard thing with that is that contracts require the head of household have a mental health disability to qualify in. So folks who fall on hard times without that diagnosis won't qualify for that one, sadly.
zjmgg4,,j0jzjc2,Right, which means diddly to most people who need help, because AZ is quick to identify people w mental and cognitive disabilities and put them on SS, which automatically helps prevent homelessness for them and their immediate family members. Which means, it doesnt actually help many people.  Kudos to both AZ and the Catholic charities for their parts, though...
zjmgg4,,izxdyls,This does exist. I just added in an edit since so many people were asking.
zjmgg4,izx4wvj,,Wait. This exists in the United States of corporate America?
zjmgg4,,izxdvh1,It does. I just made an edit, explaining.
zjmgg4,izx9r13,,Is this a joke?
zjmgg4,,izxdx3l,This is not a joke. Since I woke up and saw that you're not the only one asking, I just made an edit, explaining.
zjmgg4,izxmrkc,,Hey! I work with gov't data.   Look for HUD's HIC (Housing Inventory Count) dataset which codes specifically for places that have RRH programs and restrictions.
zjmgg4,,izxvgy8,Oo! This is really helpful, thank you! We'll take a look at that dataset tonite :)
zjmgg4,,izyk1s8,Feel free to reach out with any questions you might have. I will do my best to point you in positive directions.   Thank you for looking into open data.  Edit: as others have said, though, it sometimes helps to look at the more data oriented places first. There are RRH programs all over the US. Some have restrictions, some serve specific populations, women/children/vets first.   To get a scope, the number of programs is in the multiple thousands. Asking for a personal survey of places can actually bring inordinate attention to them.   The intention is noble, but the methods need refinement =) you might have good luck on a larger undertaking asking social science subs for open data resources.   https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/coc/coc-housing-inventory-count-reports/
zjmgg4,izy3kn3,,In Tucson Arizona there is the Primavera Foundation. They helped me get an apartment and get the utilities turned on, and I didn't have to be in one of the categories (like drug or alcohol rehab, prison release etc) to apply.   Good people work there. My health forced me to have to leave Tucson, because there really is no decent healthcare there, but that's who one calls if they need housing assistance there.   Really good
zjmgg4,izxtpdj,,When I went to school for social work we had to get these list together. Your asking homeless people to tell you about rapid rehousing in their area, but they are homeless, so they don‚Äôt have rapid rehousing themselves.   You have a job and want homeless people to work for you free while your on Reddit for information. Look at each county or towns homepage web site and get the housing department number then call them. Or, call any town/county mission yes homeless mission for the information. In California it‚Äôs called 2-1-1 information to get the info.      If your non profit doesn‚Äôt know how are homeless people supposed to know? Aren‚Äôt you the ones who should have and give this information out? Here‚Äôs a hint: all counties have a housing development department that should do this, but honestly really is over worked.
zjmgg4,,izxuyhe,I meant no harm with my question. I did *not* go to school for social work, nor did our founder. Our founder, who was previously homeless herself, thought to ask this community specifically because there are many (like her) that still partake in the community because they used to be homeless themselves, or like you, who currently work to benefit the homeless.  She's explained to me in the past that part of what got her into this work was being a previously homeless person who constantly made recommendations of and took stock of nonprofits that could benefit her peers. Some people here may fall under that category - homeless, or recovering from homelessness, but still aware of a charity that the general public may not have heard of.  We're a nonprofit with a team of 3. It is the holiday season, and as such, we're doing the best we can with our very limited number of staff. We've received some very helpful DMs and responses here, so we will be keeping the post up. What we've gleaned so far may already very well help lots of people. Also, I would hardly consider, "Hey, if you know of any shelters near you that do X, could you drop a name here?" asking users to work for us. We're asking if they have a moment to drop a tip of a shelter near them that comes to mind off the top of their heads. Likewise, thanks to this question, resources have been posted here that other homeless users in the US may be able to make use of. Some weren't even aware programs such as the typw I'm asking about existed - perhaps this post will even be the catalyst for them finding further assistance.  Having imperfect methods (especially as a charity that had so far worked at a very small level that is still seeking funding) is no reason to decide to not ask at all.

zjmgg4,izxnkgz,,The Greater Wheeling Homeless Coalition in wheeling WV is a nonprofit I'm pretty sure. They just bought another building for homeless housing and have various programs to get you housed.   You can't just show up and immediately get an apartment though. You have to address the issues that made you homeless and aim for a permanent fix to those issues.
zjmgg4,,izxveec,This is incredibly helpful, thank you :) Were you previously a beneficiary, or were you a staff member?

zjmgg4,izy4uw4,,The local homeless clinic case manager fought to get me into rent reduced housing. After years on the streets, it took only two months. My theory is it's because I'm originally from this city, because for two years straight over 140 cities mental health clinics and hospitals just kept saying to go back where I came from, which was not possible. Finally had enough and considered prison, when I came back to my birth city after many years away.

There was a user in that thread that stated she gone through the experience of being homeless, and pregnant recently, and is now working at a homeless shelter. You may want to ask that user for advice.   Besides living in Florida‚Ä¶ Your friend might be experiencing difficulties finding resources based on the lactation she‚Äôs in. Hurricane Ian was a doozy, and was immediately followed by hurricane Nicole. The areas ‚Äú in or around the Villages‚Äù is most likely overwhelmed with people who have home damage, or lost their homes completely.   Selling her car is a massive risk. If she plans on using the proceeds for housing the money will run out quick, and may make it difficult to get to work depending on her location. This is obvious, but I needed to mention it.     If she, and the other homeless mother can ‚Äúcommit‚Äù to working together it could be a working solution. Providing child care for one another, working opposite shifts‚Ä¶ but again I would warn your friend against using the capital from the sale of her car to fund this idea.   Sometimes religious organizations can be helpful, she could call churches in her surrounding area, and ask for help. When she speaks to them I would limit the details given to them. With two little ones she‚Äôs in a precarious situation. She could also call Goodwill, and the Salvation Army. Because of the storms these organizations may have been given some special funding.

zjfs0m,izv8c9n,,You are from LA, have no/very limited source of income, and decided it would be a good idea to move to the Bay Area? ü§®
zjfs0m,izvhduy,,What advice do you need? Get jobs? Move to a cheaper area? Even fast food therepays what over $20/hr?   Join a cheap gym like planet fitness so you can shower. Dial 211 for resources
zjfs0m,,izwudtz,No most fast food don‚Äôt pay that much haha. Unless you‚Äôre a new manager or maybe asst manager
zjfs0m,,izy7q39,ok either way a fast food job is better than none. I am in AZ and I have seen several hiring signs for fast food pay range 17-18hr....not too shabby for entry level no experience at all. In N out, Chickfila, Panda Express, some Mcdonalds. Wendys even advertises next day pay.
zjfs0m,,izyq66l,Usually they mean up to 17 or 18 if you read the fine print. So really they mean for assistant manager or something. Actual pay is probably 12 bucks an hour for starting employees.
zjfs0m,,izzqqei,Not here Fast food is getting so desperate they can‚Äôt get anyone hired.  My friend is going through a divorce and Chick-fil-A just hired her for 17/hr Msa AZ same with in n out. Pretty sure McDonald‚Äôs is paying more than 12/hr I‚Äôll have to ask.
zjfs0m,,j054gab,you are right about the pay, thats why everyones meals that were 5 dollars  have doubled to 10 lol,,,yes people are getting paid more but the food went up and they still dont have enough help, went to mcdonalds the other morning, the manager took my order ,,,then the 2nd window she ran to get the food and take the money! took 25 minutes in line, stated she has "no help"
zjfs0m,izvxjwe,,Welcome to the sub and welcome to the Bay area (I‚Äôm in the Bay as well, San Jose) I‚Äôm very sorry that you are in a difficult situation. I just want to remind you that this sub is **not** a place to ask for or offer assistance in the form of money, donations, free stuff, etc. There are many other subs that are set up for that sort of thing, we list some of them in our sidebar.   Most of our members are currently or formerly homeless people. This sub is a place where we can share experiences, advice, and information. It‚Äôs a (relatively) judgment free space where we can talk about issues that effect homeless people.   So for example, maybe you want some tips from others who have lived in a vehicle with a pet. Maybe you‚Äôd like some ideas on where to look for certain types of resources. Maybe you would like to hear about possible places to park from other people in the Bay area. Those are all *exactly* the type of thing this sub is for.   Again welcome to the sub, feel free to message if you have any questions about the rules.
zjfs0m,,j0221il,Sorry about that. It was for tups and tricks. Sorry again
zjfs0m,j02uksi,,There is a website for homeless and their pets. They are in Nevada but help all over U.S. just remember time difference if you call. They have a database on their website if you put in a city or zipcode it will tell you where to get free pet food. They also have free vet care and helped pay for my feral to get an operation. They paid half and friends on twitter paid the other half. They pay all of it I just didnt want all their money spent on us. For vet care you have to call them. They also have free crates. Dont know how you get them but again you have to call. They have resources on their website and also if you call them as all they deal with is homeless people and animals and probably vets to help people. They paid over the phone with a credit card so you just need a vet who will take it near you, but always call first. They are open M-F 9-3pm and remember are in Nevada. Good luck and so sorry you are in this position.      http://www.petsofthehomeless.org/

zjfs0m,j04tcvv,,where in bay area?
zj7fwv,izvatfr,,I work at a homeless shelter and most of our guests are clothed almost exclusively from our donation room. We are constantly in need of warm clothing here in Wisconsin. Find a women's shelter close to you and donate directly ‚ù§Ô∏è
zj7fwv,izuxuai,,Dropping off in front of a tent is probably not the best idea because you can't guarantee the person in the tent will be able to use what you're passing on. Alternatively, you can initiate conversation with folks and ask if they could benefit from what you have to offer.  You can try a shelter local to you, but please be aware they may not be able to accept your donation either.   The facility I work for is small and only 5% of the people receiving our services opt to utilize our clothing closet. There's a much larger facility local to us, but they don't accept used clothing, only new items. Be prepared and know YMMV.
zj7fwv,izvjn61,,My first choice would be our local mission. Their thrift store is always free for homeless. Anyone actually, their thrift store is always free but you have to be homeless or financially needy to utilize it. Our homeless shelter also accepts clothing donations.
zj7fwv,,izvn1da,Ah ok. Do they accept socks too?
zj7fwv,,izvnqw4,Yes
zj7fwv,iztx4bh,,Just Google local homeless shelters.  Also don't donate stuff to Goodwill if you want it to go to the homeless. They sell donated goods to fund job growth programs they run.  If you're close to San Antonio, TX, you can go directly to Haven for Hope which literally is the finest homeless rehabilitation facility on the planet. They have a donations depot where you can donate literally anything.  I attended that facility about two years ago. After I got housing, Haven for Hope paid for my first two months of rent/utilities and furnished my whole apartment and gave me a bunch of clothes and a pair of shoes and work boots. A+ but hopefully I don't have to go again.
zj7fwv,izvv0l9,,Since people have suggested similar, but not this exact thing.  Go across the city, grab some throwaway hangers.  Post them up like you would a sign on a telephone pole, ask politely people take what they need and can wear in maybe a sign.  This is absolutely the most effective way, as long as they're not expensive no homeless person is going to pass it up.  Although this may be rougher on rainy days, you may have to ask to put them on bulletin boards.  You'd be surprised how many places would not turn that down.  A bar I worked at when I was young would have NO issue doing this (I seen a coat up there once or twice).  If they're very specific, or people you want to help, you should only take them to appropriate 3rd parties.  I may be a member of TST, but I won't deny when a church does well, bring them to a church.  They'll be handled by a human with decency.  On the flip side, this makes it difficult for the homeless who need it but don't get around so easy.  Thus my suggestion of posting them on poles, then everyone will see them.  Car dwellers, tents, rough sleepers, couch surfers, or even those that are on the brink of homelessness.  They'll appreciate it as well.
zj7fwv,izvbmkt,,I typically donate via the NextDoor app.
zj7fwv,,izvjvb4,Lots of non needy people take from there. I only do that when my primary concern is getting something out of my house. I have to not care if they hold garage sales every weekend to profit.
zj7fwv,izwbuea,,Give directly to those you see along the way. Don't make a big deal about it in some states, like Texas, where it's virtually illegal to give anything to the homeless.
zj7fwv,izwc764,,St. Anthony's in San Franciso has a free clothing program where homeless and other needy people can go and "shop" for free clothes. Call them first as I think donations are only received at certain times. Also make sure to get the correct instructions on where to go for the dropoff.
zj7fwv,izyg7fi,,Maybe go to shelters directly to drop off
ziwye8,izul1b9,,I‚Äôm from north country originally. What‚Äôs the reason you are staying in a tent in north county if your work is in metro? Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to move south?
ziwye8,,izw8gz5,I live in a tent because rent is way out of my reach. Just because a person is working doesn't change a thing in California. My work has kept me here at the fairgrounds but I have a new job it's just in mission valley and it's not safe on the streets there so I'm having a problem getting work the events are over to late to ride the train back north.
ziwye8,,izx0a6h,No my question is why are you staying in north county if you work downtown? Makes sense if your work kept you there.  But now you say it‚Äôs a new job. There are plenty of other safe places closer to downtown than the fairgrounds. Maybe you should get a cheap car. It will be your house, you are mobile and it‚Äôs way safer than a tent.
zig4i9,izr7e15,,I just lied about mine. I mean how would they know?
zig4i9,,j01jvhy,That's what I did.
zig4i9,,j01nql5,Gotcha!
zig4i9,izra7t5,,As a homeless person, if you can't come up with an address you have bigger problems than not having a job. No one ever checks. How could they? This should be the last problem anyone tries to solve.
zig4i9,,izwe3dt,References are a bigger problem. Even shitty jobs want proof you're a hyperextroverted social butterfly before they'll even consider you.
zig4i9,,j01jzz6,That's only true if you are a job hopper. Even still most low paying retail jobs won't check or even care.
zig4i9,izrdb3b,,I understand what you're getting at. It would help in some cases, but in most it doesn't matter. The way most societies are, nothing gets changed if its not drastically affecting a large portion of the population, regardless of how ridiculous it may be. Good luck w your petition.
zig4i9,izrjjkc,,I would use the address that matches your id. If it's from another area, I'd pick an address at random and put that down. Forward your mail from the address on your Id to general delivery or a PO box.
zig4i9,izrq38o,,Honestly you can get a PO box without the PO part listed. Have done it myself
zig4i9,,izs5pks,And put #302 instead of room 302 if in a motel. Looks like an apt number
zig4i9,,iztjx30,Pro
zig4i9,izra1wn,,I work as a recruiter. I don‚Äôt look up peoples addresses and verify them. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just a way for the company to send things like your first paper check.   People put fake phone numbers like 999-9999. This just delays the hiring process since I can‚Äôt call them to offer a job.
zig4i9,iztkrfc,,Hey, never hurts to ask right?.  Have to start somewhere and‚Ä¶some areas may, just might, be more reluctant and or for whatever reason the lack of an address could be a bit of a frustrating barrier to cross.  Patiently awaiting to hear others informative replies.  Edit: Have enjoyed reading and upvoting those already taken part. Thanks

If you employer and / or coworkers are genuinely concerned and sympathetic about your situation, you really hit the jackpot.  I'd say most businesses will only think "oh this could negatively affect my bottom line" without giving 2 shits about how it affects you.  Congratulations, OP!

Save the money and make sure you have a stable foundation before you take the next step. Nothing like getting a place then losing the job for whatever reason . Make sure you like it and it fits. Just a thought.  Good luck
zi9lc4,j02z0bf,,So happy for you and hope you find an awesome apartment soon. So glad you and your pup will be ok. I lived in a homeless shelter apartment I shared with another mom and her kids for four years and finally got housing for my kids and I in summer of 2021. It is a blessing to be safe, to have our own place, and to be away from my ex. I have a bedroom to myself for the first time in 28 years it feels awesome. I wish this for you and your pup. Congrats on your job and great co workers. I love when everyone gets along and no one fights. Hope you have a wonderful Holiday. üíúüíú
zi9lc4,izru093,,Awesome sauce! Good job on working your butt off to be able to get given a chance. What anyone that's never been homeless before don't realize is that SO MANY of us(& the % gets higher and higher every week) of reg people literally being a bad day away from ending up there themselves. And that these are the same people that "think it's SO EASY,and there's "SO MUCH HELP" /s that if you DONT want to be homeless/on drugs/need mental health access is that all ya gotta do is snap your fingers and help rains down on you....that is THE FARTHEST thing from the truth!  And also the fact MOST homeless(it's just A SMALL VISABLE minority of folks that "choose" to be there or have been homeless and mentally ill with no help for so long they essentially become "institutionalized" like being in jail too late ng and DONT know HOW to live indoors and pay bills and stuff like that.) Are also the ones causing MOST of the problems that help "normal" people look down on domestically challenged folks all as useless,undeserving ,thieving,drugged up,lying,lazy, subpar(or not even) HUMAN.(NEVER understood THAT ONE) Or if there's no addiction/mental support health than SO MANY slip through the cracks..and the "visible" ones(not the people in their cars,families in RVs,working sober people living in tents,squats,couch surfing,etc) are the ones Not causing problems,but also do not receive much help. Others also forget that most "free meals"/food banks are usually during working hrs so A LOT of people go hungry(or have to beg for food/$$ to get to work) AFTER working their new shifts waiting 2-3 wks for their first paycheque(I've dealt with that a few times)and the ONLY way I ever got off the streets was due to receiving help and chances from good people that were willing to take a chance on me.   And at least until you can find yourself a place,you can also afford to keep enough gas in your car to at least run it more and keep you 2 warmer throughout the night. Do you get to bring your animal to work? Chilling behind the counter or something? Of the support animal doesn't work,mention to them he/she can just be an added bonus of "security" or a cute pup to pet to maybe lure in more customers ;) or at least if they are in your car, you can visit them during breaks. Awesome to hear and good luck with this new opportunity! You got this!

zi9lc4,izsskhm,,I don't want to be a Debbie Downer but not only do I beat you with 3 years plus, we need to keep in mind homelessness is at the intersection of society, economics and many other things, and basically you'll be high risk for years or decades. Just being real here. Your name suggests you're a woman, there's 10x or 100x more men on the street for a reason, so you might not be at extreme risk but at risk you are. Hopefully you can rebuild the social part so your assets outnumber your liabilities!
zi9lc4,,izx9pg2,I have a friend whose parents died when she was in high school.  She became homeless.  She got a job at a gas station.  She showed up on time, worked hard and studied when it was slow.  She got to know the owner of the gas station.  He told her he would loan her the money for a car if she stayed in school.  She ended up getting a degree in computers and is a multimillionaire now.  You are going to be alright, OP.
zi9lc4,,izxecr3,OK
zhzz0y,izpg6mx,,I live in my car (a seden) my routine is wake up 6am-7am almost everyday, piss or take a shit at Walmart, McDonalds or a Rest stop I sleep at sometimes, Go to work till 3-4pm, Go straight to gym and shower right after work (I don't workout just shower), Go get food somewhere, then hang out at Walmart in my car or similar locations and play video games or watch YouTube/Movies till dark then head to my sleeping spots. On weekends if not working I charge my power station somewhere or charge it off its solars. Smoke weed & play video games while waiting lol  I get plenty of exercise at work roofer/carpenter being why I don't workout or hike/run and stuff.  Boring life, But I guess my homelessness is better than most so I can't complain. I have a 1000w Jackery with 2 solar panels, A 14" galaxy tablet s8 ultra and a Mofi5500 5g router for high speed mobile internet for cloud gaming. You can play Xbox or PC games all day and night on this setup and use barely any power.
zhzz0y,,izsgifb,Smoke weed and play video games? Good thing you have your priorities straight.
zhzz0y,,izsktld,Video games is a good way to pass time for me and just save as much money as I can. So far going good, I save $3000 a month out of $4000.   I have my medical card, I smoke weed to help me just zone out and not be bored or feel depressed about my situation.  Maybe don't judge people if you dont know their life story.

zhzz0y,izutl4q,,I live in my car, and it varies. Most of the time I read or watch YouTube until I get hungry, eat, then run an app, either spark or doordash for 4-12 hours. I usually wrap it up around 1am, then hit the gym for some cardio and a shower. After that it's time to find a place to park, usually around 2 am. I then set up my backseat, and hit the hay.   Once a week or so I do laundry. Normally I find a dumpster in the apartment complexes I deliver to, to dump my trash 2-3 times a week. I'm an avid reader, so I visit the library 1-2 a week.  Right now I'm looking for a job, because the apps are inconsistent, and don't pay very well. I'm breaking even before maintenance/taxes.

zhlu9n,izmyazq,,She wants to kick you out but not give you your id ? Why? Or are you leaving and she doesn't want you to? I was able to change my address and order a replacement dl online. Or maybe your state is awesome like Arizona and you can get a replacement on the spot at the DMV. Of course you're going to want food stamps and the free phone via lifeline. There are probably youth shelters near you. Findhelp.org will help you find resources.
zhlu9n,iznwe5z,,Go to the local homeless shelter and tell them your situation. The disability should get you section 8 after they get you transitional housing. Tell the police your mom won‚Äôt give you your ID. That is illegal.
zhlu9n,,izpfx8f,When I got section 8 it took me 3 years.. got to be patient
zhlu9n,izmvs9r,,Not sure where you‚Äôre at but the first thing I would do is contact banks and any form of ID you have- report them as stolen. Then, go to a local post office and ask to apply for a PO Box (they are free in my city). You get your id and forms sent to said afformentioned post box.   This is what I did when my ID was stolen from me and I was on the street. Since you are 18 there are no questions asked.   For survival tips, try blend in with a crowd at all times. Try stay the night with friends or in a car if you have one. This is your best bet to stay safe. If not, you can scrounge out an area for abandoned houses and camp there for a bit (it takes a bit of effort and patience but I used to do this). Or you can sleep in libraries, airports, hospitals or on bus/train routes. You can pretend you‚Äôre catching a flight in the morning or you‚Äôre waiting for someone at the hospital.   Visit local churches for assistance with money, clothes, hygiene products, food stamps etc. Visit local pantries or food drives, they will provide you with a hot meal, no questions asked. Remember these people are happy to help no matter the situation.   This sort of thing really sucks and I‚Äôve been through it before as well, i hope that some of this information is able to help you. If you need any assistance I‚Äôd be happy to help best as I can, please don‚Äôt be afraid to shoot me a message. Stay strong, you will get through this ‚ù§Ô∏è  EDIT: I‚Äôm not going to ask about the mental illness because it‚Äôs not my place, but is there any way that you wouldn‚Äôt have to disclose this information to potential employers? I mean I know that‚Äôs not the best advice - some places are willing to hire anyone as long as you can do the job correctly. Apply for interviews, walk into places with signs that say hiring, test your luck and see. I have clinical depression and at no point in my life have i said ‚ÄúI suffer from depression‚Äù at a job interview. Sure, it‚Äôs the truth, but do they need to know?  No.
zhlu9n,,iznw4gg,PO Box‚Äôs cost money. DMV won‚Äôt let you use that as an address in CA. Just an fyi.
zhlu9n,,izn66ab,thank you so much! i was thinking about sleeping in abandoned houses, there are a lot around here, but i'm not sure if it's legal
zhlu9n,,izoddf2,Look man, being homeless is "illegal." When you're homeless, you're gonna have to get comfortable doing things that aren't technically legal. I'm not saying commit all kinds of crimes and shit, but you're going to need to survive. Is squatting legal? No. But sometimes you gotta do it.
zhlu9n,,izpeas5,But, most places have squatters rights... having said that it makes me sick that these people we elect to make decisions for us, do nothing to help the homeless situation, they either put bandaids on it, or make it worse üò° And yes homelessness is a violation of our basic human rights.  Also OP, I worked in storage and delt with a lot of homeless people. It takes some research, but there are places where you can get food, and here in California there are places that will give you warm meals. There's also a plan where you can get a free cell phone, not fancy, but it works. Good luck and I hope that you are not homeless for long...
zhlu9n,izo9wbg,,Call the police.  If you are 18, and she does not have some legal guardianship over you because of your mentall illness, then you are a legal adult, and she has no legal right to keep your ID.  I cannot speak to this "credit card" that you mention.... I don't know how easy it is for an 18 year old mentally ill person with no job history to get a credit card.  On the *one* hand, these "banks" today might be willing to allow anyone who asks for a credit card to get one, because creating debt is what makes them money.  On the *other* hand... I can't see how a credit card issuer would consider you a valid potential customer, since you have NO WAY of demonstrating an ability to pay a credit card bill.  So, I am not sure if you mean an ATM card for a bank account in your name, or a "credit card" that is actually just a second card on your mother's credit card account, so it isn't \*your\* account specifically, but only gives you access to her account.... or an actual credit card.  At any rate, if it is your credit card and your account, you could, as has been suggested, call the card in stolen, and get yourself another one.  If you have to, you use General Delivery at your local post office, for the new address they send the card to.  However... your ID is another matter altogether.  That's why you call the police.  When they arrive, you tell them who you are, and how old you are, and you point out that you cannot PROVE this, because she will not give you your ID.  She can SAY whatever she wants, but they are going to WANT to see the ID for themselves, if for no other reason than to confirm what you are saying.  I would not stop there, however.  With the police present, if she shows that she has the ID.... and again... no LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP over you... the police will force her to give it back to you.  You can use this momentum to get the copy of your birth certificate that she has.  Why is this birth certificate important?  Two reasons.  One...f you lose your ID, you are going to NEED a copy of your birth certificate to get anther ID.  Two... when you need a copy of your birth certificate, you are going to find out what a pain in the ass it can be to GET another copy.  So... get the one you kind-of have access to now... the one in your mother's possession.  With the police there forcing her to give you the ID, you can have them also force her to give you the birth certificate.  Don't even bring up the credit card.  Again... call it in stolen, and get another one issued to you.  If you bring it up because you want it and you won't let go of how you want it... she can obfuscate the issue by countering with how it is HER card, since she pays the bill, etc.  If the card and the account are yours, and you are responsible for paying the bill... the piece of plastic she has can be made invalid, and you can get another one with less hassle from the card company or bank.  What to pack in your backpack.... a phone charger if you have a phone, a change of clothes, an extra few sets of underwear and socks, the bare minimum of personal hygiene products you can't survive without, a notebook and a few pens and pencils, your medications if there are any... that's getting kind of full now, yeah?  You'll want a pillow and sleeping bag.  Your backpack can work as a pillow, but people new to homelessness cringe at that.  Of course... a tent would be good as well... but that likely wouldn't fit into your backpack anyway, just like the bedding won't fit INTO it.  You might have to tie or dangle the sleeping bag from the backpack.

How does she expect you to survive?
zhlu9n,izqgpjk,,Make a list of local social service organizations with phone numbers and website addresses and keep this with you at all times. You'll probably need them all at some point. Organizations such as dial #211, Catholic Charities, The Salvation Army, St Vincent De Paul, homeless shelters, food banks, charitable churches, etc. Sign up for food stamps and housing. The housing might take you awhile to get, but at least you'll be on the list. You can join certain gyms for $20 a month and be allowed to go there to shower. If you are mentally ill you should sign up for Medicaid to get free mental and physical health insurance. You should also sign up for SSI to see if you can get a monthly check for your needed expenses. You should be eligible to receive a free government cellphone. Good luck.

zgyijz,,izjq3pu,People here don‚Äôt really have a understanding of how the world works
zgyijz,,izlgoi1,Maybe 20% of my rent pays for the labor involved in providing a property. That 20% is justified.  The other 80% is paying for the real prize - land. Access to 4 billion year old land, monopolized by an elite via the successful application of extreme violence.  To everyone except the *chronically* naive that IS how the world works. Do you think I pay the Saudis so much money when I fill up my gastank because they're naturally "better" at pumping oil? No, I pay the Saudis because they won a fucking war on top of a sea of black gold.  I don't pay landlords because they're good at fixing a faucet any more than I pay Saudis coz theyre good at pumping oil. Anybody can maintain a property. I pay them because an institution with a monopoly of violence where I live granted them exclusive rights (backed by violence) to a chunk 4 billion year old rock. They then put somewhere vaguely livable on top of it and pretended they were doing us a favor.
zgyijz,,izlhy14,Also known as a mortgage.
zgyijz,,j1on4pu,The saudis only have their oil empire because the British developed it for them. Before that they were living in tents in the desert.  This is the way the world works, everyone has to navigate the system.

Thinking I can either live somewhere else, perhaps with a friend or if I didn‚Äôt want to be too much of a burden‚Ä¶my vehicle.  I went ahead and gave my long term housemate a 90 day notice since I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen. Lots of challenges, one thing at a time right.  Working on the garage when I can.

Landlords on on some shit. They overprice their property. My place is ‚Äòlow income‚Äô as well and it‚Äôs like if you don‚Äôt come up with that huge payment by the end of the month you‚Äôre fucked.

But it's not idea,  you can only stay up to 14 days in one area then you have to relocate about 50 miles away, for two weeks then you can return to the other spot if you want. Being primitive camping, you are allowed to build temporary primitive structures. Also, this is great if you have a vehicle or RV.

zgyijz,,izklctq,Renting out a home is passive income. Not a whole lot of active effort in the process on the home owners part.   It is important take note of who's money most homes are bought with. People usually do not have that sort of cash on-hand and use the banks money. Homeowner's are not so much the crooks. It is the banks. The less middle men there are in such processes the more costs will reduce and create affordability in such markets.
zgyijz,,izr1d61,I think the banks are fine. Otherwise I'd not have enough money to buy a home outright and would have to perpetually rent until I'd saved enough to buy outright.   The banks perform a service and I am grateful. I don't have to use it but choose to.
zgyijz,j0muwvp,,I need to check the history of the farm land my grandfather bought which was very close to our home, but I believe he got it in the 80‚Äôs.  It was when interest rates were extremely high and some farms started failing.    It‚Äôs actually a bit historic because the community/neighbors would come to the bank auctions, and would threaten any outsiders who appeared.  It was extremely organized on who bid on what.  Basically, the community tried to get everything back to the family.  Sometimes there was an issue with the house and/or land, so someone did have to buy that outright, but they would rent that back to the previous owners.  In some cases, a group of people would buy it.  Anyways, I believe the farm land my grandfather bought was during this period.  The family that had been farming on it for a 100 years is still farming on it.  At my cousin‚Äôs wedding this summer, some of them were there.  They did randomly bring up that ‚Äúwe‚Äù really need to increase the rent.  They feel guilty.  My dad and uncle both told them that they were ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and rent wasn‚Äôt increasing.

zgb33e,izgbphr,,The same ways anyone travels? However you can: by bus, plane, train, car, or walking.  EDIT: let's not forget boats!
zgb33e,izk4m3w,,Let's talk about my friends, M&L first.  They are a couple I met a few years ago.  They wouldn't necessarily call themselves homeless.  They live out of one of those [Datsun RVs](https://www.google.com/search?q=Datsun+RV)?  The cute little ones that have the small Datsun (err.. pre-Nissan) front, and the small full RV cabover on the back?  Their rig has a punch-out for the dining area as well.  Once a year, they go up to the Dakotas/Montana, and they work harvesting sugar beets.  They each come away... after between a month and six weeks... with between $3500 and $5000.  They then proceed to live on that (maybe) $10k, for the rest of the year.  The rest of the year will consist of them spending a few months here in the winter/spring, living cheaply... and living with friends/family for a few weeks (out of their RV) in cooler summer locations in NY state, Michigan, etc.  They will go from hot springs (wherever)... to rubber tramp locations like Quartzsite... to open BLM land.  Occasionally, when the party is hard on their wallet, one might take a few weeks with light work.  Sometimes L will get work at the Fountain of Youth springs up the road from here, as it is also a trailer park with amenities.  Once or twice a week, sure... nothing to support anything other than what they might want to drink and smoke while they are in the slabs.  And that's how they live.  On the one hand, they have their home on their back.  For them, they can "rely" on friends and family, because their demands are always extremely light... they bring their own food, shelter, power, money.  They just need a place to park it.  They make friends wherever they go, and they make connections... and most of the time, those connections are like this...  >Hey M... we are renting a cabin/getting a boat with a few friends.  Why don't you and L come out and stay?  Not like a rich, bourgeois thing.  These people were slabbing it up with them the previous season, living just as dirty.  These people making the offer might have stayed at M&L's camp while here in the slabs, and were "repaying the favor".  But.... that gives M&L a target to get to... and that eats up two months of the year.  Spots like Pagosa Springs, this place... pretty soon, they have to CHOOSE between where they want to go, as opposed to struggling to find just one.  Are they homeless?  Technically... yes.  I've sat and have had many a smoke-filled conversation with M to know that they are disillusioned with enough of today's crap, that this is their way of tuning out as much as they can.  It was a conscious, if not even a subconscious decision on their part.  I'm sure they both gravitated this way before realizing it was the life they wanted.  Homeless by choice.  Nomads.  But when you rotate the point of view out, and get a wider picture.... it is what they choose to DO with homelessness that is the forest we should be seeing.  Again, they have nothing "permanent" to fall back on, should things fall apart.  Except maybe limping here.  There are a few of those Dolphin/Datsun campers here that aren't ever leaving... in one piece.  Tried pulling one out of the clay once with my 1989 S10 4x4, when I first got here.  That didn't happen.  Poor S10. Best $400 I spent in 2015.  Lived in it... carried me 1300 miles from WA to here, with only three shock absorbers.  Good four year investment.  What makes them different from someone with a backpack and shoe leather?  The camper, for one.  Yes, that was shrewd spending on their part... but really... that's not as hard a hurdle as one might imagine.  The trick was getting to where the money was being handed out like candy, in exchange for "short" bursts of labor intensive work.  ***Sprint for a month, coast for a year***.  I know a few homeless folk who do seasonal work in tourist towns.  These are places that see huge swells in the population only during certain seasons... and many employers will provide housing as well as a paycheck.  The work could be selling T-shirts and beach towels 40 hours a week, in an air-condition store 100 yards from the ocean, in a town where everything \*you\* need (food, booze, substances, companionship, entertainment, etc) is within walking distance.  And you live above the place where you work, and you can work in a t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops.  And you get paid cash, every week with a bonus if you last the full "season".    The people I know take the money, save most of it, and either use it to fund their "adventures" over the winter, or they get a place in town (cheaper, with the severe off-season population drop), or they go to a different seasonal spot, and do the same thing.  Provincetown, MA and Key West, FL are popular in this regard.  Both cater to tourism heavily, both see dramatic differences between in-season and off-season populations, and their seasons compliment each other.  There are many homeless who just bounce back and forth between these two locations, living in places they don't own or rent that are provided by their employers, working for cash, and usually living hard in their downtime.  They aren't on the streets, because they found a loophole.  When all you have to save, is the cost of the bus ticket to the place you spend your winter... where you'll be doing the same thing until you only need the bus ticket to where you spend the summer.... and your signature holds you to nothing... you are homeless.  There are other names... but that one still fits.  There needs to be a willingness to move, as much as the ability to move.  If one is able to work a harvest, then it is only a matter of that individual being willing to do whatever it takes to GET to that harvest.  Once it is over... once that month or six weeks is done, there's like $5000 to go and GET some kind of vehicle with.  I'm not even talking the legalities... but it is very easy to prove residency in South Dakota, with a single night's stay in a motel (aka the receipt), and that can be turned around into a license, and registration for the vehicle you just worked to buy.  At the harvest in that state.  If one needs all of that in one go... there are other states, and other harvests.  Now... moving stuff around from city to city isn't as much of a problem.  What about what was given up to get the vehicle?  Depends on what was given up.  If it was a tent and camp set up that was finally weather-proof?  You now have a metal and glass shell on wheels to provide a mobile camp.  You can go BACK to where you were, if you want to.. but now you can go ANYWHERE much faster than before.  When you ask this question... what is the image in your head that you are working from?  Are you looking around you, wondering what you would do with it all if you were to go homeless?  Are you seeing a tent, or a tent camp, and wondering how those people would pack up all of that if someone came along and said "move"?  Do you imagine that there's a number of people who regularly migrate between homeless tent camps and emergency shelter concentrations (there are, btw)?  Some reduce what they have, to what they can carry on their backs... even if they don't move around from city to city.  This is a very secure way to be homeless, because everything you have, can be with you all the time.  In regards to mobility, it is more about being homeless in an area that is hostile to homelessness... where you can never fully depend on any location you choose as being actually secure.  So you need to be able to move without losing anything, on short notice.  That's why I ask about what inspired the question.... homeless individuals are... individuals.  There's more than half a million of them in the USA alone.  At one point, I saved for a train, instead of taking the bus.  I carted luggage, and two heavy stacks of boxes that SHOULD have been cargo, but I was exceptionally pathetic and got it all allowed at every station.  Even got one of those big, wood and metal, four-wheel hand-trucks in almost every station I needed one.  Fuckin Chicago.  Not the city... just that day in that train station.  That day hurt.  It was in the middle of digging myself out of one homeless situation, staring down a Northeastern winter, to be homeless in the pacific Northwest.  Not Seattle.  I mean... I came into Seattle on the train... but I was there for like... and hour, maybe?  I did get back there for another hour or so, a few years later.  That's how I moved with my stuff, from city to city, when I was homeless in... what... 2013?  In 2018, I used that S10 I mentioned earlier... that I was living in at the time, to move me and my stuff from WA to southern CA.  So, personally, I've found that the method of moving my stuff, depends on what I'm moving, and how I'm getting there.  And if my getting there depends on what I've got... I get rid of shit until it isn't a problem anymore.

zezip5,iz96ydd,,China is capitalist
zezip5,,iz979x7,I don't think you know what that means. Not trying to be condescending, capitalism is a system that values and seeks to gain as much profit as possible, regardless of the human life or natural resources it ruins in order to gain that profit, such as the US.  Socialism is a dictatorship of the proletariat, aka, working class people. Communism has never been done, though communists are who bring about Socialism, communism would be a world wide phenomenon only after every country had its own socialist revolution, in which humanity would once again return to a classless, moneyless society.
zezip5,,iz9q91l,capitalism is a system that values and seeks to gain as much profit as possible, regardless of the human life or natural resources it ruins in order to gain that profit  that's what China does.
zezip5,,iza64nr,That's pretty much China. Land of the suicide nets and living at your job.
zezip5,,izjt902,True.  I forgot where it was in China that there are reports of slave-labor camps.
zezip5,,izbllbx,Nobody cares about the textbook definition of communism based on the notion of communalism that advances from socialism. Just cause you saw that in a book somewhere once you feel the need to inform everyone, that actually real communism has never been attempted. It doesn't matter, that's not what's the words mean. No one is impressed.
zezip5,iz9eime,,Interesting that pickles and nip_pickels blocked me, unblocked me to reply, and then blocked again. Lol! Most homeless people do not work, that isn't true. I hope the elderly couple in SS get an income restricted apartment before the section 8 apartment becomes available. I know they take a long time to get, which is a big failing.
zezip5,izcgmmw,,There are so many things wrong with comparing homeownership rates in three countries of various size, in different years, across different economic models, with no controls or adjustments for other factors that might be influencing the housing markets in each country. Plus, Wikipedia is not known for being well-sourced and accurate. In other words, all you proved is that you know how to find pages on the internet. Your comparison isn't valid.  There are somewhere around 300 million homeless people in China if you include people on the streets, in their version of shelters, and doing their version of couch surfing.  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12324](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12324)   I'm so sick of hearing that capitalism is the cause of homelessness. Finland is a capitalist country, and it has very little homelessness. There is no one factor that causes homelessness.  But, hey, you're welcome to move to China and prove me wrong. You might want to talk to some people living in Hong Kong first, though, about how well Chinese rule is working there. And lest you think you can stand on a street corner in Beijing, yell the equivalent of "Let's go Brandon!" then go home to your nice comfy house, let me leave you with two words: Tiananmen Square.
zezip5,iz96poe,,Sure, Cuba is much better than the us!
zezip5,,iz96ra8,Cuba is worse off because of the US
zezip5,,iz96tsa,Cubans are dying for capitalism
zezip5,,iz971b1,Cubans are dying because the US puts so much economic pressure on their country that they are willing to flee to anything else in order to survive. Any working class person would be for socialism if they actually knew what it was, same goes for communism. Unfortunately the ruling class has perfected propaganda, and makes people think the flaws of capitalism are just a part of life.  Every socialist nation that has fallen has done so because of imperialistic capitalist empires
zezip5,,iz979im,Sure yeah. Everyone who tried it ' just didn't do it right'. If these nations just listened to the internet they could build a truly wonderful system! Cuba is opening up to capitalism because communism failed YET AGAIN
zezip5,,iz97epe,It's not communism, it's socialism, and again, it's because of the US placing extreme sanctions and restrictions over the Cuban population. But what I wanna know, why is a homeless person arguing in favor of a system that thrives off their suffering?
zezip5,,iz97ilm,Do you think a communist country would give you a home you didn't work for?
zezip5,,iz97uc8,I would feel more inclined, not less, to work if it means my needs are met, and my job was fulfilling. If you think I'm lazy for wanting guaranteed housing, wait til you find out about CEOs.   Why do people so brainwashed by capitalism always see the worst in humanity, and yall act like capitalism is the only system that's ever been around.  What do you think people did before money was a concept. Do you think people just sat around all day long? We've plenty of resources to meet everyone's needs, yet more houses sit empty than there are homeless people in the US alone. How does that make any sense to you?
zezip5,,iz97zmi,Communism doesn't supply you with fulfilling work. Communism that works the way you think is a fantasy.
zezip5,,iz984ne,Lol says someone who's never lived under communism, and I highly doubt you've lived in a socialist country, but by all means, keep throwing tired ass billionaire talking points. You know what they say, no one defends billionaires more than hundredaires
zezip5,,iz97mmg,Doesn't even need to be a communist one, that's what every social democracy does, including the US.
zezip5,,iz981gz,Yes, I am a proponent of ' housing first'
zezip5,,iz9ot61,Why am I a capitalist?  Because I like not just having the bare minimum of things, but NICE things...and as much of them as I want, or can afford to buy.  China is the exception, but most communist/socialist countries don't produce much besides necessary items...which sucks if you want more choices in what you buy.  The Soviet Union barely gave anybody outside of government any choices at all.  Imagine waiting in line half a day for your months supply of single ply, 40 grit toilet paper? No Charmin for you, comrade.  What's that, you ran out last week?  I'm actually kind of a minimalist...by choice, but I like having any number of quality items available to me, if I want them.
zezip5,,izavb0m,Fellow capitalist here. I like it for much the same reasons that you do. ( And, like you, I'll probably get negged for admitting that. )  **China is the exception, but only for a few decades.  Their model of socialist government but capitalist economy is not stable in the long run.**  They will succumb to revolutions.  A capitalist economy will cause the middle class to grow.  A middle class is the source of successful revolutionaries. ( The lower classes tend to generate rioters - who can be put down by force.  The upper classes generate so few revolutionaries that they can be co-opted with titles and power. )  The middle class will generate too many revolutionaries to be bought out, and they will be too well educated and to wealthy to be crushed.  Grab some popcorn.  Chinese politics will be very entertaining in the next decade or two.
zezip5,izaltew,,>Capitalism needs homelessness, and poverty in general in order to function  I'll agree that Capitalism is at fault, but not for the reasons you believe.  Capitalism encourages and rewards greed.  Greed is to blame for homeless in capitalist countries.  Well... greed, and fear of becoming homeless both cause homelessness.  How can a fear of homelessness CAUSE homelessness?  Because it isn't Capitalism that is voting against opening a new shelter or soup kitchen.  It is the average, every-day citizen who is terrified of how close they are to homelessness itself, who goes to the town council meeting and votes against the proposed assistance.  It is Greed that keeps the people who have the money from making sure it makes its way down to the people who need it more.  Communism failed.  Every attempt proved ultimately corrupt, with an elite class living off the efforts of everyone else.  Socialism has only proven feasible when combined with capitalism.  By itself, it also fails.  The concept of Capitalism isn't the problem.  It is the current execution of Capitalism in the USA that is the problem.  People like Bill Greehey and Mark Donovan have proven that Capitalism can be used to HELP the homeless, as opposed to requiring people to be homeless.  Bill Greehey is the guy who started Haven for Hope by himself in San Antonio, and Mark Donovan is the guy who funded the Basic Income Test Pilot Program in Colorado they just started.  If you want the fastest solution to eliminate homelessness in the USA, change the laws so that each and every Senator and Representative HAS to live at the same economic level as their worst-off constituents.  And change the laws so they can't re-zone their way out of having poor constituents.  Do that... with NO OTHER alterations... and homelessness will vanish in this country.  It could still be as capitalistic as it could possibly get, and the fact that the people who make up our government have to ENSURE there are no homeless so they themselves don't go homeless... would take care of the problem.  And Schoolhouse Rock used to make sure we all knew that laws can be changed in this country.  So... if you can eliminate homelessness, by making the governmental representatives DIRECTLY responsible for improving the quality of life for ALL their constituents, homeless and homed... then obviously Capitalism can't be the problem.
zezip5,,izb35jp,>I'll agree that Capitalism is at fault, but not for the reasons you believe. Capitalism encourages and rewards greed. Greed is to blame for homeless in capitalist countries. Well... greed, and fear of becoming homeless both cause homelessness.  That is a good insight.   But let's go back one more step to put the blame where it really belongs.   **Tax laws are the ultimate culprit.**  The home mortgage deduction encourages people to put their money into housing, even if they could not afford it otherwise.  It encourages people to be over-invested in housing.  &#x200B;  >It is the average, every-day citizen who is terrified of how close they are to homelessness itself, who goes to the town council meeting and votes against the proposed assistance.  Too many everyday citizens have nearly all of their savings in their house.  ( Any investment counselor can tell you that this is stupidly risky, that you should diversify: have some investment in your house, some in stocks, some in bonds, maybe a little in gold or other precious metals. )  A person who is diversified can afford to be generous.  Maybe the proposed local laws will cause a decline in the value of his house.  But since he has investments in other things, he is not existentially threatened by it.  Indeed, he may be investing in the corporation that is building low-cost housing.  But, with the current tax laws, many people who own houses have lopsided investments and are thus are terrified that they could lose everything at one stroke.  So they vote against anything that could threaten that investment.  Change the structure of federal tax laws, particularly the home morgage deduction, and the behavior of most home owners will change.
zezip5,,izd4g35,>Tax laws are the ultimate culprit.  You mean, how tax laws are handled in the USA?  Because although Norway has a socialist government, and citizens there can get university degrees for free (as well as other benefits), they do this by levying heavy taxes.  It might seem that their taxes are lower... with the "top marginal tax rate" only being 39 percent as opposed to the US 48 percent.  But... that tax rate kicks in at a MUCH lower income level than the US... at 1.6 times their national average, as opposed to the US 8.5 times our national average.  I agree that our tax laws are screwed up pretty heavily in the USA... but Norway proves that the concept of taxation can be handled better and be far more beneficial for a population.  So... I'm just trying to clarify whether you have an issue with taxation, or just taxation in the USA.  Because again... I'm on the same page.  We screw our citizens with how our tax laws are set up.  Most of our citizens, at any rate.
zezip5,,izpeczo,>Tax laws are the ultimate culprit.  &#x200B;  >You mean, how tax laws are handled in the USA?  Yes.  I live in the USA, as do most readers here, and apparently yourself, so the implied nation is the USA.  But we are talking about two different features of taxes: 1) The levels at which taxes kick in, and 2) the deductions off of those taxes which promote/discourage certain activities by the taxpayer.  The more that #2 is done well, the less objection I have to #1.  Conversely, the worse #2 is done, the more I am concerned about #1.  On the question of homelessness ( which is the issue at hand ) the incentives for the average citizen in the USA are greatly distorted.  This leads to over-investment by homeowners, excessive NIMBYism, and consequent rising housing costs.  =================================================  If I were king, the incentives would be reversed.  Income tax would be abolished, with all of its loopholes and perverse incentives.  ( Why should we have any tax on productive activity? )  It would be replaced with property taxes on the ground value of their property ( AKA just the dirt ).  This gives all homeowners an incentive to keep the land use small, which is an environmental plus.  Government programs would be mostly paid for by the rich.  ( They would pay taxes on their mansions directly, and indirectly on the cost of the Lambo because the dealership would have to cover its property taxes. )  There would be one, and only one deduction.  Each homeowner would get a personal deduction of about 50K on the value of their property.  Everything above that would be taxable.  This would put small homes - averaging 1000-1400 sqft like almost everyone had in the fifties - in reach of even minimum wage earners.
zezip5,,j0fjf8y,I'd go a different route.  I'd go officially Subgenius for my $35, and create a "church" and a non-profit to put a branded, pay as you can, soup kitchen in every city and town.  Free food open to close, with menu items you can pay for.. and onsite laundry and showers.  Maybe services will only mean everyone has to text the official church number, with a "thanks" before eating breakfast.  Or email.  The chaos on the receiving end appeals to me, strangely enough knowing I'd be part of that receiving end.  But making the meal more interactive digitally, for that moment, where they only have to say thanks".  Nothing else.  No god involved.  Then onto Housing First projects.
zezip5,,j0eg5b7,Looking into some of my audio books, I‚Äôve got some that have been helpful in understanding some of the financial stances your communicating here.  One such audiobook Great Courses plus ‚ÄúMoney Manangement Skills‚Äù by Michael Finke   It‚Äôs mentioned to have a variety of investments, doesn‚Äôt mean a hundred and that more is necessary better. Just that you shouldn‚Äôt have all your savings in one stock, sort of speak or as an excellent example you used‚Ä¶a home.  Where I‚Äôm needing to gain knowledge in for sure here, is tax laws.  Any good resource recommendations other than the typical ‚ÄúRich Dad, Poor Dad‚Äù type?  I‚Äôve searched audiobooks mainly because, for me, information sinks in better if I hear it, as opposed to, reading it.
zezip5,,izd1l38,Enjoying the discussion‚Ä¶I really need to figure out how to insert partial passages the way you two are doing‚Ä¶it cleans up and sharpens the focus of discussion nicely.  Personally, I‚Äôm not that well educated (perhaps just plain understanding is better phrasing) on the greatest factors, along with varying Governmental bodies, which influence homelessness.  Nor am I on tax law either, yet there‚Äôs plenty here that‚Äôs peeked my interests I hope to get around towards looking into to get a better understanding.  In the meantime, Changing the current tax law option, while offering many greet points and all still seems to take a ‚ÄúLeap of faith‚Äù or a bit of a ‚Äúgap‚Äù in my opinion when it comes to Homeowners behaviors changing no?.   Like, why is there a certainty that Homeowner behavior would change in such a predictable way and to what extent would that reshape homelessness?  Could anyone add to this?   Admittedly, I feel like there could be some bias in my reply here. Yes, my example here may be off the mark, idk yet, we‚Äôll see what happens.  In military marches, it‚Äôs just a better idea to put those struggling, those slower, in the front.  It‚Äôs just being practical‚Ä¶if you care about them and your unit as a whole.  It‚Äôs hard to lose sight of someone in front of you, who clearly cannot out pace you‚Ä¶but you can be there to help motivate them to keep going.   To keep moving, even when they don‚Äôt think they can anymore.  If this person goes to trip, you may have the chance to catch them.   If they happen to fall, you can be there to pick them up and set them straight.  This is how we care for one another.  Today we care for another, tomorrow we may be ill or have burdens to heavy to bare.  It‚Äôd be nice to have someone standing behind us/with us.  Don‚Äôt be a certain Senator during a Texas Winter Storm and fly off to Cancun.  I‚Äôm inclined to agree with bongart, put that guy in a home without utilities and see how fast things will get changed and for the better to all.
zezip5,,j0eegyh,Alright, I finally got around to putting some time into looking up the two organizations mentioned:  Really l liked what the first organized mentioned, ‚Äú Haven for Hope‚Äù is about.  Something newish started in my area, but I‚Äôll need to look into it more.   The Basic Income pilot program is unique as well‚Ä¶I could see the benefits for sure. It provides a necessary stability.
zezip5,,j0ffge7,I do get it.  Without a bankroll there isn't much an individual can do.  Organizing is, however, one of those things that not only doesn't need a bankroll, but it can help generate or locate one.  Organizing is like, 90 percent drive
zezip5,iz973jq,,Random aside in communism everyone has to work. I have no idea why people who complain about capitalism forcing them to work to live Revere communism or socialism. All systems require work
zezip5,,iz97lii,No one said anything about people not working, but I'd rather work without ruthless exploitation. And knowing my neighbors are also taken care of. Lenin once said those who do not work shall not eat, he wasn't talking about unemployed workers though, but rather those who would exploit others in the name of profit, such as landlords for one example.  Humans are naturally productive creatures, and we always have been, even before money or capitalism were either a thing.
zezip5,,iz97vdt,Landlords are not evil. How is someone who prefers to rent being exploited? In the us a person can get an FHA loan with 500 earnest money if they want to own. Section 8 vouchers can be used to own. Not everyone wants to. They like paying the rent and having the ll deal with maintenance
zezip5,,iz97zu2,I now think you're trolling, and if not, I'm not going to exhaust myself giving you a college level economics course, nor explain how people would much rather be secure in their housing rather than rent, are you for real right now?  Have a nice day though I guess
zezip5,,iz985rd,You're unaware of the tons of people who prefer to rent? They like the freedom to move, the lack of having to save up for emergency repairs, and other things.
zezip5,,iz98g5b,I'm starting to doubt you're even homeless, and if you are I truly pity you then, but I'm not taking this discussion seriously anymore, idk what color the sky is in your world, but honey, people would much rather have stable housing than not. Of course you could run a poll I guess, but I'm assuming the actual homeless people in this sub, or at least the great majority of them would rather live inside.  Have you ever heard of this neat concept called empathy? Check it out, it's wild, like other humans have feelings and physical needs, crazy right?
zezip5,,iz98juq,Tons of people prefer renting to the responsibilities of buying. It's also difficult to move.
zezip5,,iz9dq3d,"tons" of people isn't "all" the people renting, nor is it even half.   You should really look into the housing crisis, it's not just happening here, but in other developed nations as well.   In fact, it doesn't even matter what percentage of people prefer to rent, the fact is *TONS* of people are now stating that the system has made homeownership unattainable to them. That's unacceptable in modern society, and doubly so at the rates we are hearing.
zezip5,,izasjy9,Many people DO rent, just for those reasons already mentioned...they don't want the burden of ownership.  What people DON'T want, is to pay exorbitant rent prices.
zezip5,,iza16og,My "portable" section 8 voucher requires me to give it up and hope I get issued a new one if I move to a different county. And not one person I've talked to who oversees section 8 knows how to allow someone to use it for a mortgage. Yes, I know the government claims it can be used that way but they seem to have forgotten training the providers about it.
zezip5,,iz9d32q,Nah, the problem is that working still doesn't guarantee home ownership.   I know it's hard to believe, but the majority of our homeless population either works or has social security income.   Social security in this country doesn't pay enough to live on, and other forms of welfare have been slashed to the point that they're unavailable or unhelpful as well.   I know a homeless elderly couple who are on a 2 year wait-list for housing. People think Section 8 is handed out like candy, but it isn't.
zezip5,iz9m0p0,,You're absolutely correct.
zezip5,izjt3g3,,OP how many other countries ha e you lived in? I feel like there are some pre conceived notions in your post
zev5ex,iz8nrpl,,I was so cold that day, and just needed to rest, til I looked up and saw the sign I knew wasn't an exaggeration. So I decided to write a little message of seasons greetings to the people of this church, who'd rather call the cops on homeless people rather than maybe advocate for turning their building into a cold weather shelter.  Like did they skip over the story of the very person they came to worship every Sunday?
zev5ex,,iz9ven8,I am curious as I can't tell at all, does the church share the land or rent it? I know that can be an issue with Property owners. Insurance companies may forbid them from allowing it and can and do threaten to drop coverage which could get the building condemned regarding public use. There are other reasons. The sign could be there to appease the Insurance company. There are also many hypocritical churches and lying Christians.                 I used to sleep behind a church and they didn't care so long as it wasn't messy with junk or garbage. They would even leave out blankets and bring us food. Then there was an overdose and a fight with property damage over a weekend and that was the end of that. The pastor showed me the paperwork from the insurance company about a month later when he said we couldn't stay there any longer.  He said if he saw us or even any evidence of us there he had to report it or lose their coverage and possibly be closed. He might also be replaced if that happened.  He did tell us that he came by the church around 8am but never earlier or after 10pm and he smiled. Eventually someone left a bunch of garbage and ruined it for the rest.
zev5ex,,izccidh,wow what a story! yes,,,unfortunately one bad apple ruins the bunch, an overdose and a fight ,,yep,,,guess that would be a no for most!
zev5ex,,iz9wfwn,I mainly pictured the worst of these people because of I was in a traumatic situation, considered them as Christian as Joel olsteen, who the city where his mega church resides had to *beg* him to open his big ass "church" building as shelter for hurricane victims
zev5ex,,izc8gs2,I remember that. I think he made a comment about them being dirty and he didn't want to make a mess. Literally zero empathy and worse. I think he is a true sociopath.
zev5ex,,iz9w7zz,I admit I was full of anger and resentment when I wrote this out, and being how affluent the neighborhood appeared it could very well be a problem of homeowners in the general area against seeing homeless folks resting up.  It just felt like such a punch to the gut, I was so cold and exhausted, I have hypoglycemia and didn't know when next I'd eat either, turned out not until later on in the evening when I finally just boosted some food. Homelessness is such an isolating experience. It's why now that I'm housed I do outreach on my own, and thankfully my church has worked hard to advocate with the city to open a cold weather shelter, but even then they won't allow them to open the doors unless it's 20 degrees F or lower.  I just wish more church's would open their doors, seeing as there's no shelter options for real here. Abandoned hotel right downtown, but unless you got kids you're kinda SOL
zev5ex,,izcctkg,also people need to man these buildings if they are open,  quite difficult to do to find the staffing , just sayin
zev5ex,,izc8ja5,I completely understand.
zev5ex,,izbg9xo,> He did tell us that he came by the church around 8am but never earlier or after 10pm and he smiled.   Good guy ü•≤
zev5ex,,iz9e5u0,Nah, they know the story, they're just evil.
zev5ex,,iz9em98,I hope they felt shame when reading my writing on their sign
zev5ex,,iz9ez1n,I'm sure some of the people there would feel shame if they saw it, but the person who wrote that sign seems incapable.
zev5ex,,iz9gj5b,I was numb and in pain from cold and exhaustion, had no food to eat and was new to the city, didn't even know where to go for any resources. Calling the police on exhausted poor people is definitely not christ like, especially given the time of year, just smacked me of irony. The church I currently go to opened their doors as a cold weather shelter as my city has no real shelter options, and the pastor had to basically convince the city to allow it, which they did, but just barely.  If a building is going to stand empty, and a building people go to worship someone like Jesus christ at that, shouldn't they practice what they preach?
zev5ex,,izdrzjg,>shouldn't they practice what they preach?  I heavily suspect you've never participated in Christianity or you wouldn't ask this, you'd just know that hypocrisy is the actual cornerstone of the religion.   Most christians only care about one thing: convincing themselves that there is a good place that they will go when they die, and a bad place their enemies will go when they die.   Pay attention to Christian outreach programs, they always lead with: Do you know what will happen when you die? It's nothing but fear-based propaganda.
zev5ex,,iz9fqmz,The janitor was probably the only one who saw it.
zev5ex,,iz9g6cz,Sadly you're probably right
zev5ex,izbrg8r,,I'm sorry you had to go through this. I wish everyone who considered themselves a Christian/God fearing of any faith actually acted like it.
zev5ex,izcx2qt,,I think it is more complicated than you think though because as innocent as you are with your best intentions, there are other people who are aggressive, steal, on hard drugs or do other problematic things, and these people aren't just a threat to the integrity of my building, but to the other people who want a place to rest. For this reason, there needs to be a vetting process, rules, a person who works there to always keep watch in case something bad happens and they need to call 911. It is one thing to let you stay if you ask me but to just leave my property open to just anybody isn't smart. Maybe mention the need for some space to be available to those who are homeless or just ask the Pastor and he can make some room for you.  Other than that. I would feel the same way you did if I were you. I wouldn't be surprised if they just don't like homeless people though and that is just sad. I have sat on many concrete floors talking to my homeless friends and I see how you get treated. It's absurd how they complain to the police just because you are sitting somewhere they don't like seeing you at. Those people are going to have some issues with God on judgement day. You though, have Heaven waiting for you.
zev5ex,izezfva,,I dont think its surprising people dont want homeless camping on their property. It is private property.
zev5ex,iz9ryvf,,This kind of thing only makes a difference if the person who is reading it is a Christian and is one of the Christians that actually cares about the poor and being Christ like. Non-Christians, are not going to be persuaded by this and good people will be good people regardless of whether they are Christian or not.                   To those that celebrate Christmas and derive hope from their beliefs Merry Christmas. To the ordinary folks happy holidays, and to those of other faiths may your holiday season be blessed.
zev5ex,,iz9sck8,I didn't realize this was a church, damn.
zev5ex,,iz9utx9,It was a Christian church in a nicer area of Portland, and was just short a couple weeks of Christmas day

zels0f,iz9ej5v,,I have heard these programs exist for the elderly, but I suspect if you're working you are too young.   Sorry, Florida is the Fuck You State when it comes to the homeless.   Pro Tip: don't sleep in your car in Brevard County, they will arrest you for that.  Edit: Some places offer assistance for the security deposit, but not the first/last months rent. It goes through an outside service, and I think it's actually an insurance you buy so you won't receive the money back in the end. Not sure about utility down payments.
zels0f,iza3nbh,,Let's see.  [What does HUD have to say about Florida?](https://resources.hud.gov/)  HUD... the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  They are the ones behind Section 8, Section 811, and the Housing Choice Voucher system.  As it turns out... they have a few other tricks up their sleeve.  HUD also provides subsidies to apartment complexes, in exchange for having a certain number of apartments set aside for low income residents.  You don't need Section 8/811/HCV to get one of these apartments... you just have to make below a certain amount of money.  In most cases, it is also similar to a Section 8, in that you only have to pay a third of what you make, for your rent.  The link above, is to the HUD Resource Locator. You'd want to choose to Find Affordable Housing Near Me.... the overlay that pops up first has that as the first option to the top left.  Click that.  It will pull data from your connection as to where you are, and show you all the apartment complexes near you that got subsidies from HUD, and therefore have apartments set aside.    The resource locator also will show you any USDA low income housing.  An example would be a farm house on USDA land.  Residents wouldn't be required to farm the land... that was already being taken care of.  But... there's still a farm house there.  Someone should live in it... and the USDA works with HUD to make this possible and affordable.  Most of these end up being tax credit properties, but not all.  And... it shows other low income tax credit properties within urban areas.... but those would be more expensive in the short run, because you'd be expecting to get the money back when you filed your taxes.  IE... why it is a tax credit property.  I just threw Tallahassee in the search to see what was in Florida.  Within the ring, there are 14 apartment complexes with low income apartments, and 11 tax credit property listings.... and the Public Housing Authority location for Tallahassee... where you'd go first if you were looking for low income housing there.  So... find the nearest Public Housing Authority.  Use the Resource Locator to get an idea where the apartments and properties are in your area.
zekk0c,iz7u11a,,I've been fortunate enough to be in a hotel room for the past week, one with a stove and a refrigerator ‚Äî and I cannot begin to tell you how much I missed being able to cook properly. I've cooked a little bit out on the street, when I can find the time, energy, and place to do it. But just being able to cook a proper meal on the stove, and then refrigerate the leftovers ‚Äî words cannot express how much I've missed that.
zekk0c,,izane0j,It's the best feeling to wake up on a bed. To have a nice warm shower. To eat healthy and cooked foods. I can only imagine. I've not had cooked food in months. I've been eating food from gas stations.   I'm proud of you. I think about this so much. Just walking to the fridge and warming up a meal literally sounds so good.   Hope your situation continues to improve <3
zekk0c,iz7rfv0,,I missed ice tea.   But I also missed having a cat. My kitties passed away about a year before I became homeless. As soon as I got into my new apartment, I adopted one -- a big, fat furry orange tabby. I will work my ass off to stay stable and keep a roof over his head and food in his tummy.
zekk0c,,izao6zv,I cried myself to sleep last night thinking about my boy. I miss him so damn much.  Sorry to hear about your loss. Losing a pet is excruciating. Aww, that is so cute. I love fat cats. They are so adorable.  I hope you're able to find happiness with your new cat and keep you both housed and safe. Awesome story to share. I'm happy you got out of homelessness. Inspirational.
zekk0c,iz8ivre,,Safety. Esp being a young girl. Just being inside my own room by myself and knowing no one can touch me is the greatest sense of relief ever in my life. The walls of a room/apartment feel like armor‚Ä¶ i could never truly relax til i had a place of my own. No more having to sleep with one eye open. When i finally became housed after a while of homelessness, i had nightmares for months reliving all the bad things that used to happen and they would wake me up terrified then i realized its all a dream and i was just so relieved that past was behind me. Could finally be safe when sleeping. That alone was life changing
zekk0c,iz7w8nw,,We are lucky enough to be staying with friends and have esa letters. We‚Äôve been able to keep ours but I also know I‚Äôd be destroyed. Especially knowing my elder cat wouldn‚Äôt survive a shelter. Plus shelters around here wants over a hundred bucks to surrender an animal, per animal.   There are services to have them temporarily housed in response to so many people becoming homeless but those have wait lists.   It‚Äôs very hard and I hope this universe brings you two together again.  When you are housed again try contacting the shelter you surrendered at to see if they are being fostered etc still and see if you can possibly find them if they are still there. They may not be but if they are it could be a reunion.
zekk0c,izaulcc,,2. Access to cleaning facilities was definitely missed. I always felt nervous/anxious trying to go for a bird bath in single occupancy bathrooms in places like fast food joints, because the staff would be hammering at the door if you were in there for more than 60 seconds.   I also missed being able to poop in peace. I've never been one of those quick 30-second poopers; I relax and take my time, just let it flow, listen to whalesong. Instead it's public toilet stalls with those weird fucking gaps everywhere and you make awkward eye-contact with people also coming in to take a dump.  3. When I first became homeless I was sleeping rough (on the streets) and I feel you on this one. Sandwiches, salads, and cold pasta every day. That or junk food. I definitely missed cooking, as it was a hobby of mine. I was lucky when, in my second stint of homelessness, I wound up living in a few homeless veteran camps that had rudimentary cooking facilities. That was refreshing and fun.  6. Don't write this off. I got more companionship and ass in the ~5 years I was homeless than I did in the 15 years before that. I've dated plenty of girls who were homed while I was not - and they were fully aware I was homeless. I've also been with homeless women too and just recently got out of a nearly 3-year long relationship with a homeless woman I met in a homeless camp. We're both homed (separately) now. Don't write off dating just because you're homeless; plenty of women don't mind.  I SO feel you on losing your cat, I really do. Myself and the girlfriend I mentioned above got a cat just after we got out and moved in together. After we split up, this year has been fucking *rough* for me financially and I've come perilously close to returning to homelessness. While I was grimly prepared, mentally, to deal with that again, the thought of having to give up my cat was depressing af. I'm sorry for your loss, OP :(

zeas1l,izh66n0,,Does anyone realize the scope we are talking about here?  There are a couple of interesting points that have been brought up in the comments, and when you put some of them together, you get a better picture.  First... guessing at number with other stats to point the way... there are likely between 150,000 and 200,000 homeless in NYC.  Maybe less... likely not.  NYC puts 60,000 homeless and at-risk individuals in a bed every night... emergency shelters, transitional housing... I think there's some group housing in there, but the count is for  temporary assistance.  That's 4 times the number of beds that Los Angeles provides for their homeless.  If you look at any given city in the USA, there are on average one third the beds to shelter that city's homeless population.  If the pattern holds true for the #1 city for the number of homeless.... that'd be around 180,000 homeless or so.  How many of 150,000 homeless, do you think would be mentally ill, and on the streets?  1% might be pushing it... but that's still 1500 people.  And as has been pointed out, where are these ward and institution beds coming from, in an already overtaxed mental healthcare system?  [There are 97 hospitals in The Entire State Of New York with Psychiatric beds](https://profiles.health.ny.gov/hospital/bed_type/Psychiatric+Beds).  If you want to get your own exact count, each link on the list will show you details, including the number of psychiatric beds in that hospital.  The first one on the list?  It has 12.  The second one has 26.  Maybe they might have 1500 psychiatric beds  between them all... but that is for the ENTIRE STATE.    So.  Filling up the wards across the state of New York.. with just one percent of the homeless in NYC.  Yeah... locking up 1500-3000 homeless, out of 150,000... that's going to make the other 147,000 just disappear.  How can anyone call this a cleanup?
zeas1l,,izrlqn2,Space is something I'd like to know about also but to the other points, far more homeless than 1 percent have mental health problems and this new mayor has pledged also to work out the red tape issues that currently have 2600 supportive housing apartments sitting vacant. Already he has filled more in a few months than his predecessor did in years.   Also all the people taken in for evaluation, the I ject is not to keep them all locked up. It's to stabilize them and release to supportive housing with community care.  If I'm ever in front of an apartment I haven't lived in for years waiting to be let in because I'm out of my mind, I hope police will take me in for treatment for this and whatever other delusions have me in this terrible predicament.  And he didn't say this, but if I'm ever strung out on drugs to the point of sleeping in the subway go ahead and involuntarily take me for that too.  I agree with him that if someone can't meet their basic needs, that qualifies as danger to self and they need assistance whatever the cause of the problem, voluntary or not because then you get into the rights of people wanting to safely take the subway to work and other life tasks.   An uptick in violence including another subway murder caused this to take place if I'm not mistaken.  The schizophrenic homeless man I used to help finally found a place to stay. Some other guy wants his help or company. But for years before that I wanted the police to take him to the hospital.  Inability to feed himself or get shelter from freezing temperatures to me constituted danger to self, and that is what this mayor is saying   I felt like if medicine could cure his delusions that he works for homeland security he could then apply for SSI and housing. Allow someone to do that for him. But at present he believes that will end his career that doesn't actually exist which is fucked up.  Wandering around making the situation worse with meth is also fucked up   He's not exercising freedom when his decisions are based on delusions.
zeas1l,,izsofhn,>far more homeless than 1 percent have mental health problems  I can agree to that.  I was trying to be conservative with my numbers, because even shooting low with them points out part of the glaring issue with this being some kind of conspiracy to clean up NYC streets of the homeless.  We could say 10%.  We could say 50% of the homeless in NYC have some kind of mental health problems.  Of course... this proposal doesn't apply to everyone with **any** kind of mental health issue either.  It only applies to a percentage OF those homeless with mental health problems.  Not everyone with a tic or twitch is going to get rounded up.  >Also all the people taken in for evaluation, the I ject is not to keep them all locked up. It's to stabilize them and release to supportive housing with community care.  Again... more sense as to why this isn't some conspiracy to rid NYC of the homeless problem.  But the fact of the matter is.... NYC already houses 60k homeless.  There are more than that that don't have shelter.  NYC cannot lock up the remaining homeless for "mental health reasons".  They simply do not have the SPACE, at all.  NYC cannot even afford to lock up a significant percentage, so it LOOKS like they cleaned up the streets.  So.... if it is physically impossible for NYC to use this as some sort of cleanup... then it HAS to be about assisting people.  NYC can't lock away 10's of thousands of people... but it CAN force a few thousand into psychiatric care (to be rehabilitated and put into housing).
zeas1l,,izv57zp,Gotcha. Yeah, it's not a conspiracy
zeas1l,,izxzups,Now.. as to violating the rights of those people who are affected by this...  ... can this be a viable case of the end justifying the means?  Is there ***ever*** a viable case for the end justifying the means, or is it always a "greater good" argument and living with themselves afterwards?  I guess I'm trying to establish a baseline here?  I can ~~see~~ imagine that, if psychiatric care, medication, and assisted housing would improve the quality of my life AFTER I went through the procedures, I \*might\* be grateful.  That would depend on what was expected of me at the outcome.  If I was free to be me, and I liked who I had become... I'd have no problem.  If I was spit out as a slave to the state until I died, working a meaningless job to support a life that only kept me able to work the meaningless job... I \*might\* have a problem with being removed from my homeless surroundings and pushed through NYC's version of the Play-Dough Mental Health Fun Factory.
zeas1l,,izzzavj,So no, they don't have the capability to even do that.  We are not in a communist or socialist state where people are assigned work. I find it funny that reddit has so many people asserting that capitalism wants to force people to work for its own ends. That it requires everyone to participate when that's actually socialist and communist systems.  I don't think bezos or buffet care in the least how many people do not work for them, just that enough do for them to underpay and remain very profitable. The homeless population doesn't threaten that, they are not needing more people turned into ' wage slaves'.  I don't know what can be done to accommodate people who simply don't want to work to provide for themselves or feel that it's simply too taxing for the reward of merely having a roof and climate control and food and so forth.  Slab city seems to be a very unique situation. Would you have it expanded somehow? They've tried fencing off areas and saying ok you are allowed to be here and we'll provide showers and bathrooms and even food....it always ends up being closed down due to dangerous conditions.  I guess the jury is not in on abbottville, the latest attempt at such a thing. I've only read there is a lack of access to services thus far. It sounds very inhumane to me, but it's inhumane to other residents to have homeless people on their porches.  One redditor described a man in their porch she thought might be dead, but upon calling 311, discovered he was passed out in feces and he then got some more drugs and passed right back out.  Do I want to turn him into a wage slave for the tax base? Not personally no but....idk I mean WHAT is society supposed to do with that?  Build shelter with nurses to supervise safer injections, keep them clean and nourished?   Is it more humane to force them off drugs and then let them decide yeah hey, this is so much better, thank you, or.....honestly my imagination runs out at this point.  If they insist they'd rather steal for drug money to return to living that way there is no option but to incarcerate.  My mind cannot conceive of an alternative if they lack family or someone to support a life of remaining high.  It's preposterous to me, the idea that fellow citizens via taxation, should be required to support that. Or to tolerate the theft and violence and people passed out on their porches! (California) or the inability for subways to be safe and clean and serve their purpose ( NYC)  Mentally ill, hypothetically if a person is trapped by delusions that render them unable to notice or care that they lack shoes, that shelter is possible, how to access food and such, one would think they'd be glad if medication restored their ability to be rational.  Whether they then want to work at a low wage job is another matter. Many might end up on disability payments. Assuming more affordable housing is built, in theory at least, hopefully made into reality, the disability payments would in turn provide a small apartment or a group home might be more suitable for some.  At least they'd have more choices. And if more affordable housing is built a low wage job would still provide shelter and so forth.   The only thing I know is that mentally ill individuals who cannot meet their own basic needs, it's inhumane for them to live outside.  For some institutions would be kinder even. At least there is climate control and food and medical care. No freedom to be sure. Ideally they'd improve to accommodate more outdoors time at least.  Our state hospital used to allow more outside time. People can take a job there for money to spend on fun food. What else there is to spend on I don't know but there was a canteen to buy hot dogs, fries, other foods and drinks.   The homeless schizophrenic I talk about described it as a ' resort'.   In my ideal world more hospital space would be created and conditions would improve dramatically.  More staff means more freedom. Instead of everyone having to be moved around together like cattle all day, they could be given choices in activities to participate or free time to choose what to watch, read, etc.  Taxpayers though seem more willing to pay for prisons than life enhancing facilities. Which is barbaric but cheaper for sure. It's at least 1000 per day to hospitalize.   Housing with outpatient care even if the person doesn't work but can function independently is cheaper than even prison if memory serves.
zeas1l,,j02n9ji,>We are not in a communist or socialist state where people are assigned work. I find it funny that reddit has so many people asserting that capitalism wants to force people to work for its own ends.  This is true.  Yet, the USA is a country where one \*could\* be presented with a single viable housing option after exiting rehabilitation, and be presented with work that was connected in some way to the rehabilitation they just went through.  This can and does happen, even in a capitalist country.  The accommodations and job may be presented with a "We found you this..." prefix in the conversation, and they may be presented to save the newly rehabilitated individual the hassle of looking for these things.  A caseworker doesn't have to be either socialist or communist, to be nice.  I personally gave you the two extremes that applied to me personally, in regards to how \*I\* would feel if I was scooped up in a sweep, deemed to require psychiatric care "against my will" and pushed through a system more as a patient/prisoner than a participant.  Since I can imagine two extreme, but possible scenarios in this country that I live in, I can also imagine how I might feel differently about the process  after I've gone through it, depending on the outcome.  If I felt I was better off after I went through something like that, I'd support it.  If I felt I was worse off after going through that situation, I wouldn't support it.  I cannot look at this concept, without including the expected outcome, and personally judge it to be good or bad.  This doesn't mean I cannot see how something like this could be abused, and misused.  That just turns it into the Gun argument.  The gun isn't at fault.  The person who chooses to use it carries any fault.  The concept of "Let's get the worst mental health cases who really need help, the help they need and get them back into some semblance of society" in and of itself, is not a bad concept.  If it is used an an excuse to lock people into prisons, or the equivalent... then it is just a concept that is being misused; used in a bad way.  There are limited valid reasons for using a gun.  Hunting for food... again... LIMITED, but still valid.  One could argue that strict defense of home is a valid use of a gun.  Again... limited.    What was presented in California, and now in NYC... in and of itself, in the most idealistic way possible... is a "good" concept.  It is the execution of that concept that will tell whether or not it is going to be used in a good or bad way.  >I don't think bezos or buffet care in the least how many people do not work for them, just that enough do for them to underpay and remain very profitable.  Well, Bezos is under scrutiny and facing unionization, for the way his employees and "independent contractors" are treated.  So, he's being forced to care by both the employees supporting unionization, and the media who keep bringing up how the Amazon drivers are treated.  Would homeless people make good Amazon warehouse employees?  Probably not under the current way Amazon does things.... they are currently making employees quit or look to unions to improve job conditions.  Taking a homeless person who has been out of work for a while, and expecting them to perform adequately, immediately, at a pace that makes experienced workers quit, is unrealistic.  They'd still be homeless though, even with the Bezos based job.  And Amazon can't really tell customers that orders will be delayed while they train the new homeless employees on how to fill the orders.  I mean.. I can see Bezos wanting to try to bleed some good-will press out of Amazon hiring the homeless, but it would get torn apart in social media almost immediately.  It sucks that we live in a country, where the people elected to run the country are mostly only interested in collecting wealth, power, and status.  Because they support the laws and concepts that promote these things... which always ends up screwing over the people holding up the entire system... there ends up being a country like the USA.  You know the old saying... everything in moderation?  We currently HAVE no moderation of capitalism in the USA.  People are drunk on it.  People are addicted to capitalism, to the point of their needing to be CA meetings as well as AA meetings.  And you can see where I'm going with this.  Capitalism... like **a**lcohol, **t**obacco, and **f**irearms... needs to have regulation.  Capitalism... like Socialism, and Communism... are concepts.  Things.  In a perfect world... yeah... something like Communism might be a good thing.  A society without money... with everyone having equal access to everything they need to be the best individuals they could possibly be.  Pipe dream.  Star Trek.  One possible future, hundreds... if not actually thousands... of years away.  But these are still ideologies.  It is how they are used, that decides whether or not they are good or bad.  ***Regulated*** capitalism could be a force for good, globally.  I don't have some plan outlined, detailing what regulated capitalism might look like.  But right now, we already know what unregulated capitalism looks like.  And it is unregulated, when the richest makes the rules, brazenly in their favor.  >Slab city seems to be a very unique situation. Would you have it expanded somehow?  Slab City is... a failure... if one is looking to it as a solution of some sort.  Slab City is an organic experimental social vessel, with **no one** at the helm.  It has, and does expand... and contract.  Technically... the "Slabs" is a rectangular area that encompasses all the concrete foundation slabs left behind when the military removed the base in the 1950's.  This chunk of land is owned by a Teacher's association.  The rest of the land that is occupied by people... Poverty Flats, the spots near the bunkers and the hot sprints... is all land owned by the Bureau of Land Management.  There is a strip of land on either side of the canal owned by the state, and a few farms on the outskirts that have land in common.  And East Jesus bought their piece of desert.  They don't consider themselves as part of the slabs.  Salvation Mountain was painted on BLM land.  Slab City is organic, in that, what it started as, is NOT what it is today, and it has gone through multiple different phases along the way.  It has been here for close to 60 years now.  In the 80's, it was THE destination spot if you were a snowbirder, with upwards of 3000 people with RVs and trailers staying for the winter by 1988.  Now... we've got a dozen die-hards.  No one person said "this is a place I made for this, come and be part".  No one decided it was going to be that.  A few found it, word got around, etc.  As there is no one in charge, there are no rules.  So... now... we have a population that likely is 50% pro meth, and I'm being conservative.  Theft is accepted to the point where if you are robbed, you weren't protecting yourself well enough.  Using one's actual name is very rare, and names will change from season to season.  Would I expand this?  I... would quietly form a corporation, and purchase all the land... and give everyone who lived on it AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME and equal share in the corporation.  I'd use the corporation to leverage loans that could be used to improve the camps in Slab City... doing stuff like running power and sewage lines under the camps, so from the surface everything looks like it does now.  I'd bring in heavy equipment, and use $2000 freight boxes underground as rooms (better temperature control in the desert) and do this for ALL the camps, so that people would have a Slabby camp on the surface, and a nice underground apartment beneath.  I'd have the Slabs run like an Adult, no rules Amusement park, put a fence around the whole thing, and sell tickets.  That's what I'd do with this place.  Slab City is a societal fringe... a look at where society would or could be, a few years after things fell apart.  It is not a model to emulate.  It is proof that rules and enforcement of those rules, is necessary in a society.  In the short term?  WooHoo... party it up.  In the long term, you need security cameras watching your shit all the time.  In this place, someone can burn you to the ground, just because they don't like the friend of one of your guests.  Or maybe they gave you a puppy a few seasons back, but now they've gone over the edge and are burning camps and killing all the dogs that came from them... aka Styx.  He's a guy here now.  He believed that his dogs should die, and all the puppies they produced should die, and was actively hunting them down for a while.  And he's still here.  >It's preposterous to me, the idea that fellow citizens via taxation, should be required to support that.  There is a difference between a mentally ill person who turned to street drugs as some kind of alternate self-medication... and a drug user who has essentially become mentally ill through their drug use.
zeas1l,,j059qo2,I also worry about abuse but the lack of space, while a bad thing overall, might retard abuse via keeping people longer than they need to be kept.  The way it is now, if you've not hurt anyone, among other factors, you ( whoever ) are more likely to be released too soon to create bed space for someone more acute who has been court committed.   There is a long term building now in my county for those who are supposed to be in state but there is no space, and people are frequently discharged before the 3 months it takes to get a bed in the state facility. Sometimes because the person genuinely improved , other times because they improved enough to gamble discharging because the people needing to be newly admitted are of course not treated at all yet and have a more pressing need.  I don't see how Cali or NYC will be successful in their efforts lacking space. Some people require months even if the correct medication is given from day one and others would need to have their medication changed before seeing a difference.  Cali says their court committal will be to community services but that presumes the person will abide by the court order, well CAN  and will. Surely a percentage will not and would require a more restrictive setting.  I hope you win the lotto and buy slab city to do with as you collectively decide! :-). Send me some to have a better life inside my little box :-)
zeas1l,,j07gskp,>Sometimes because the person genuinely improved , other times because they improved enough to gamble discharging because the people needing to be newly admitted are of course not treated at all yet and have a more pressing need.  That Play-Dough Mental Health Fun Factory image will not leave my mind.  Throw the people in... push really hard to force them through the mold, and squeeze them out in a steady stream... ready or not.  >I don't see how Cali or NYC will be successful in their efforts lacking space.  Not only is the lack of space a concern... a lack of trained medical personnel is a concern as well.  There aren't enough trained mental health professionals for the people who use assistance to get the help.  Most health insurance plans don't cover mental health costs the same way they do physical health issues (there was legislation passed to force insurance companies not to do this), but currently it is very difficult to FIND mental health care that will take Medicare/Medicaid.  Everyone trying to get help by using state aid, basically, has to wait in line.  Homed, and homeless alike.  Which means... do NYC and Cali have the professionals necessary to handle the job they intend to do, in the time it \*will\* take to do it, considering their "facilities" will have to work on a production-line schedule, based on their lack of space.  >Surely a percentage will not and would require a more restrictive setting.  Scooping them up for "the process" of forced rehab would hopefully give the medical professionals the time necessary to determine who might need a more restrictive setting.  >I hope you win the lotto and buy slab city to do with as you collectively decide! :-). Send me some to have a better life inside my little box :-)  Let's just say... I'm above graft/abuse in the sense that each share of the corporation would be surrounded by legalese so no one could own or control more than one share, to maintain a single voice per share and to keep others from taking one by force.  I'm NOT above graft/abuse in the sense that \*IF\* somehow this fantasy of a pipe-dream \*DID\* come true... I'd send out invitations to a few people just before I made the corporation and figured out how many shares it needed to be divided into.  There's no accurate count of the Slabbers anyway.  I compare this place to an apartment building that fell over and no one moved out of the wreckage, because although there is a small-town sense in how people want to know all the gossip, it is more like an apartment building where you know almost none of your neighbors.  A few more strange faces right there when it happens won't surprise anyone.  I'd only want this place to spread, as a franchise or chain.  A corporate-owned free zone, so to speak.  Plop one down at some other no-where location, or in an old abandoned industrial location.. build infrastructure to provide necessities, and then open the gates.  THOSE satellite installations would be owned by Slab City, of course.  Can't support the hedonism going on in the original location, if we just give away satellite locations.  Everything in them... the shelter, power, water, waste disposal.... all free.  So... not profit generating facilities.  Food?  That's more up to the people inside, and what is available locally.  If they can get shipments from a food bank, but need a loading dock to accept them, the location gets a loading dock.  For this place... I can see using a pile of money, to build an ice house and small water purification plant in Niland.  Then, all the water brought into Slab City is actually clean.  And Niland gets clean water too.  And cheap ice... and a better Emergency Heat Shelter than the police station.  \[sarcasm\] Cuz THAT is where questionable people want to hang out when it is 120F. \[/sarcasm\].  No, we can't drill for water... the groundwater is laced with lithium and other things, and comes out hot.  But that's another potential endeavor.. taking the run-off from the hot springs, and diverting it from the waste water canal, to drying pits, so we can sell the lithium.  We know it is a viable plan, the University of San Diego wants to do this with the waste water from our local Geothermal plants.  We currently let that same water, that comes from the failed well attempt by the military in the 1940's and fills our hot spring, just mix in with the fertilizer loaded field waste water canal.  Money down the drain, if we had a drain.  Who knows... maybe some rich benefactor will read this deeply into this thread, and throw money at this idea, as a way to legalize his new flavored meth concept.  At least the SC Corporation could afford to hire and keep trained medical personnel on staff and on location 24/7.  An overdose and violence safety net, so to speak.  Ah... pipe dreams....  \\
zeas1l,iz5ihe7,,well, i probably have an unpopular opinion on this topic in this sub.   let‚Äôs start out by saying the mayor here is explicitly issuing this order in regards to MENTALLY ILL homeless people. i am an EMT in los angeles county. MOST of our patients are mentally ill homeless people, and we don‚Äôt need their permission to treat them and take them to get help. it‚Äôs called implied consent; if a person is cognitively not aware that they need medical attention, the consent for medical treatment is implied and granted to medical authority. this applies to people who are unconscious and/or mentally handicapped.   i have a very morally sound set of ethics and i‚Äôve never once felt bad about this. most of these people have serious medical issues, deformities, are bleeding, unsanitary(which also poses a risk to others), and it isn‚Äôt even uncommon to find MAGGOTS living in open wounds on their bodies. these people need help and are completely unable to comprehend what is happening to them. often times when we are called to a homeless person who is clearly mentally ill; we will do our best to talk to them and get their consent to come with us, but once again if they‚Äôre so far gone that‚Äôs not possible the consent is implied anyways. we then take them and treat them and the state gives them shelter, medical attention, and food. are those people happy that they aren‚Äôt wandering around on the streets anymore with maggots living in their skin? that was their ‚Äúfreedom and liberty‚Äù that was taken away. im not sure, i‚Äôve never seen the prolonged care portion for these patients. but at this point it becomes a question of simple humanity; what is more important? giving these people the freedom to unknowingly wander around, killing themself, eating out of trash cans and spreading diseases and infections, or to give these people medical attention and shelter and food ‚Äúagainst their will‚Äù? i‚Äôm not sure the answer to that question honestly. but again, i‚Äôve never once felt like i was doing something wrong.   apart from the medical aspect, having been homeless before myself, i‚Äôve always believed that nobody should be punished simply for existing. there are homeless people who in some part choose to be homeless or have come under certain circumstances. sure, if you chose to be homeless or have fallen on hard times, my apologies and best of luck in life. but there are many, many mentally disabled people living in the streets who have NOTHING and NOBODY. those people don‚Äôt deserve to live that way just because they were born with a decreased mentally capacity. they‚Äôre still humans.  of course i can‚Äôt speak for the police in new york. and time will tell whether this becomes an actual breach of liberty and freedom. if they start going around like the SS rounding up each and every homeless person on the street, that‚Äôs of course bad. but right now they are saying they‚Äôre only going to be providing help for the mentally ill. time will tell if it really goes that way.
zeas1l,,iz6i4v6,I remember getting a Subway in New York City and wondering why all the people were on one side of the train while I sat down on the empty side. A few seconds later I realized it's because the only other person on this side of the train smelled strongly of raw sewage. They had clearly s*** their pants and were just sitting in it.  It ended up becoming a source of amusement as I joined the people on the other side of the train and we proceeded to watch people have the same experience stop after stop. That was probably the most disheartening homeless experience I witnessed in New York City but certainly not the only one like the man who was screaming at the sky sidewalk in Brooklyn. I can understand why a city would need to commit people who are like that for the sake of sanitation and order.  Of course there's the worry that this will be over broadly implemented and simply lead to the incarceration of people for poverty.
zeas1l,,izh33lu,As an EMT in LA.. how do you feel about Gov. Newsome's bill... the one that inspired this move by NYC?  Has it changed how you handle mentally ill homeless?
zeas1l,,izht78h,to be honest, little of what is passed in regards to homelessness has any effect on us. we are simply there to provide basic life support and first aid to those who need it and transport them to definitive care. once again, i can‚Äôt speak much to what happens at that level as i am not involved in that part.  EMT‚Äôs aren‚Äôt a tool for the state in regard to trying to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù homelessness. it‚Äôs just simply the nature of our job and that civilians will make calls about the homeless guy who looks like he might be dead laying on wilshire, or the homeless lady who is sitting in a pool of blood screaming at the sky on santa monica blvd, or the homeless guy who is running naked on the 405. yes i have seen all of those things.  my personal opinion in general? im not a fan of newsom at all. but the government of california itself can‚Äôt be solely responsible for the rampant homelessness here. by virtue of the nice weather and sheer population that is bound to happen. there‚Äôs also a misconception that california made it legal to allow homeless encampments to exist, but that was product of a federal lawsuit if i remember correctly. that being said, i will once again reiterate that nobody should be harassed simply for existing. having been homeless i understand. but there comes a point when there are homeless who have no intention of doing anything with their life besides doing drugs in their encampments. that‚Äôs just not good any way you look at it. or, as aforementioned, the mentally ill homeless who desperately need care but wouldn‚Äôt even know how to get off the street if that was even a thought going through their mind. those people do exist.   i think they are doing what they can but at this point it‚Äôs too far gone and i don‚Äôt think they will ever be able to solve it. working fairly closely with police i can also tell you they have a very hands off approach. not enough people and too much to deal with, i feel bad for those guys. if somebody is not a threat to themself or somebody else or their property they will pretty much ignore it and any ordinance they are supposed to be enforcing. it‚Äôs not worth it to them.
zeas1l,,iz5ytpn,You cannot look at people deprived of basic needs and under extreme duress and diagnose them! Many of those "mentally ill" people are simply overwhelmed by their current circumstances!
zeas1l,,iz6p5eb,Well they probably have PTSD depending on their experience. If they lived outdoors its almost a definite. I have seen it over and over and over because of trauma and homelessness itself is traumatic. Never mind people stealing from you and assaulting you, hurting you in many ways. People yelling at you, stores and businesses throwing you out, police making your life hell, etc...  I have a lot of experience with homelessness.
zeas1l,,iz68xiu,Put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but - gradually increase the temperature and it will boil itself alive. We are near boiling ourselves alive
zeas1l,iz6hp59,,Stupid, who determines mental illness?   I've seen several different shrinks over the years to please my dear mother, and the responses have varied from a talk therapist flirting with me, praising me as intelligent, down on my luck, and philosophically interesting, to a male psychiatrist who suggested I was a risk to myself and others after I implied he should be lined up on a wall for making his living dealing amphetamines to 5 year olds and pointed out his apparently drug induced twitch
zeas1l,,iz6ypyz,lol. country, especially nyc is crime and mental illness breeding ground. they should start with themselves because all have accomplished what all wanted, which is mass insanity, brainwashing, idiotic education system, "values", and everything else.
zeas1l,,izgqsn5,Horror movie shit
zeas1l,,izrly37,People out of their minds sleeping in the subway because they can't function and no one helping them is a horror movie.
zeas1l,iz7ls9q,,The right to be unable to care for oneself? The EMT above covered that very well. I personally would add on the right to be a drug addict and make a home out of the subway? There has to be a balance. People riding the subway to and from work deserve safety. Everyone deserves a place to sleep. It isn't fair for the subway riders for that sleeping place to be the subway. But most importantly for this initiative,,,,,if someone is in an altered reality suffering on the street out of our misguided notion to let them be ' free' it's beyond inhumane. I knew a woman with bipolar who ended up dancing naked for crack in the street. She doesn't do drugs, this was manic behavior. She needed her right to safety and dignity. Which meant a hospital stay and meds. Maybe everyone in this sub is in full control of their brain, but surely you' ve witnessed others that are not?
zeas1l,iz8dvuj,,Do they have the space? I highly doubt that
zeas1l,iz5e6ne,, Yeah if you‚Äôre homeless in New York they‚Äôre just going to throw you in a psych ward. That must be terrifying. One talk show guest was like it‚Äôs taking away people‚Äôs right to liberty.
zeas1l,,iz5vrp0,How do they even have space? I'm genuinely perplexed, because mental health is an area that is underserved nationwide.   I used to have a job where I would have to find psych beds for people who actually needed them and there was almost always a wait. Also, the hospitals would only keep you for 3 days anyway, which isn't nearly enough time to stabilize someone in a new med regime, and just boot the patients back to the real world to fend for themselves.   How does New York have psych beds for people who don't genuinely need them? This isn't the first time I've heard this specifically from New York, I'm baffled.
zeas1l,,iz7mltl,I would also like to know that. In California they are proving housing along with court committed outpatient care. Which is good. It's inhumane for people unable to care for themselves to be homeless, subject to all the danger.
zeas1l,,iz89lvy,[deleted]
zeas1l,,iz9bz50,I think you missed the point, which is that those beds are already full of people who need healthcare. How can they possibly have space to run their mental hospitals essentially as prisons for the homeless?  If they fill the mental hospitals with the homeless they're leaving the mentally ill to fend for themselves in society. If they do this, the problems will increase not decrease, although they will change in nature.
zeas1l,,izd6rn4,They are not putting all homeless in there, the point is to stop leaving mi homeless in the streets to fend for themselves. Not all are meant to stay in facilities either. The object is supportive housing with outpatient care. Their supportive housing system is fucked. I read an article last night about 2600 vacant apartments. They do a bad job of pairing approved applicants with the spaces, but this mayor is doing better than his predecessor
zeas1l,iz6i3ur,,This article is terrible and has some very obvious bias. Disregarding that, I have a serious problem with police officers being the ones to make the determination regarding a person‚Äôs mental health.

zeas1l,iz96imn,,Criminalizing the homeless and mentally ill more than we already are. It would be astronomically cheaper just to house literally every single homeless person, but this isn't about saving money, or lives. It's about control. They use the fear of homelessness as a threat over the working class.  More likely to accept a shitty place to live with ever increasing rent, yet without the quality of the housing reflecting the rent raises. And of course this threat also makes people accept shitty underpaying jobs, working so much just to make ends meet, people are too exhausted and apathetic to fight for better working and living conditions. Instead people just accept homelessness.

zdp1jh,iz3jx3y,,Used much of the advice shared here when I had to make my way out to NC.  Came in super handy. Wipes, are the way to go‚Ä¶never tried corn starch though for body powder. Hmm.  Ended up saving my plastic grocery bags for‚Ä¶well everything.  Cleaned up a bit in a laundromat bathroom that had terrible lighting and toilet paper, but thankfully my bag had a strap and clips I could hang off of the doors bulky hinges to pull stuff out easier.  Ended up finding a community center once to use, since I wasn‚Äôt going to be in the area long.  Also, lucked out at a boat dock and separate park close by‚Ä¶both had bathroom facilities. Coldish, but everything was there. Rotated use.  The boat dock had showers; however, those were locked with keypad locks. One of the things I‚Äôd do in my spare time was pick up a grocery bag of trash, every so often‚Ä¶some park maintenance employees came by to clean up and so I asked them about it.  That‚Äôs when the one guy was nice enough to point out that the women‚Äôs door lock was broken (I had never checked it). He thought maybe some young kids or something broke in.  The light dial was broken and of a timer design. Took a few minutes for me to figure out that the head of a standard house key could be used to turn it.  The guy didn‚Äôt think the water would be warm, it actually got plenty hot though. Now the room was cold-that day and time the weather was bearable enough.  The next times I used it‚Ä¶just tried to balance the timing out with the higher temps of the day. No mornings.  I made sure to strap the door since it didn‚Äôt lock‚Ä¶just in case someone happened to open it up while I was in.  Other than that, I had an emergency bucket in my vehicle I hoped to never use again.  For a urinal though‚Ä¶by chance I had a Large Lysol dish detergent jug this time.  Like 220 ounces or something. Best urinal I‚Äôve used yet. Lemon fresh.
zdp1jh,iz4ix0z,,For a while, there was a farmers market a short walk away from where I was sleeping outside, and they had porta potties. If I had to crap, I would go there (unless it was one of those HITS YOU AND YOU GOTTA SHIT RIGHT NOW feelings). After the farmers market was done for the year, they got rid of them a little while after that. But that was only really needed on Sundays or late in the day when the closer places to me were closed).  If I had to pee there was a private enough outdoor spot to do that. For a while I had a milk crate I had a bag in I'd use for #1 or 2, and I'd take it to a dumpster when I felt the need to...but during one of the under the bridge church services I attended, someone took it. :(

My friend walked the Camino De Santiago in Europe this year which is apparently a 500 mile stretch that about 350k people walk every year. To me it seems so intense and yet there are humans that willingly do this as a pilgrimage of sorts. They say on average it takes 30 days. Maybe with can read up on preparation docs for that? I know that there are hostels along the way so obviously that part will be different..  maybe you can carry a tent? And another little piece of inspiration that may be of help to you, there is a woman called Peace pilgrim walked for 30000 miles for peace with nothing but the clothes on her back. She had a shirt that said on the back what she was doing and people offered her stuff but she never asked.  To me that was wild to contemplate.

The shortwave function works like a champ, it uses 2 AA battery but I can buy usb rechargeable AA battery so it's not a big deal.   400w of AC electricity ? It sounds like you have a solar generator/ battery back up type of system, just me guessing.
zd99p9,,iz1f40d,I have access to electricity on someone's back porch but going over about 400W will blow a fuse and be awkward.
zd99p9,,iz1gk1u,It would be the best if you have a power bank with an AC outlet and a good size foldable solar panels in case you can't access to that outlet. But in that case, you gotta be careful of thieves when you charge your powerbank outside using the foldable solar panels.
zd99p9,iz42f7b,,These are good for emergencies but severally suck as a charging source
zd99p9,iz3nvdf,,We have a good sized battery pack that we plug in at the library and an emergency radio for weather updates.
zd99p9,iz0eyi6,,I started out with [this](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832701403065.html?src=bing&albslr=118650968&isdl=y&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US) one, bought it for $17 at Newegg in 2015.  I now have [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kaito-KA350-Voyager-Trek-Solar-Crank-AM-FM-SW-NOAA-Weather-Radio-with-5-LED-Flashlight-Gray/280817097) one, bought for $27, also at Newegg. I don't rely on it charging my phone, but I do have two analog powerbanks that work just fine, each having 4 - 18650 Lithium batteries and providing 3-4 full charges on my  LG smartie.
zd99p9,,iz0ixj6,Looking good, Kaito is pretty famous in making emergency radio. Yeah I do agree with you about not relying on emergency radio to charge your phone normally, a powerbank would be way better but it would do in a pinch I guess.
zd99p9,izdp0b6,,Most actually have a cellphone or tablet with free service believe it or not
zd99p9,,izduuph,No one said that they don't have phone or tablet. I have a smartphone and a laptop but I still enjoy listening to the radio from a real radio.
zd99p9,,iznkyuf,And I was merely suggesting that said radio can be listened to on other devices, you went for an attack instead of clarification good job
zd38xs,iz833qa,,I was just going to call them again tomorrow because I've exhausted all options, have to be out of this flat by the 21st and I'm an electric wheelchair user... This was not the news I wanted to see. Especially when even on the emergency line I've never gotten an answer, just a "all our operators are busy, please try again later" :( cue panic in 3...2....

zd38xs,,j07tvbl,No improvement BUT there is apparently a new team in citazens advice which is for housing advice - I spoke to a lady today from them and after hearing all my long term illnesses etc and just how awful the council have been, breaking thier own policies etc, she is gonna raise it with them - if they still don't help and change my allocation/homelessness priority etc she said they may have a good case to take them to court.  So that's a thing atleast! But in the meantime it's just a wait and see game, wait for the court action to start, wait for them to talk to the council etc etc. Which is all well and good, but man, it's stressful. I was street homeless a few years ago when my mobility was much better and no one tells you the worst things about it - because it's traumatic, so having that on my mind is awful.  Thank uou so much for asking, it's been a horrible time.
zd38xs,iz4xnym,,Wow.  Shelter workers in the UK get paid?  In the USA, we only have unpaid volunteers at shelters.

zcruji,,iyy76q0,I just read that multiple people were stabbed there. I don't know if I'll actually be able to sleep if I go there. Thank you though.
zcruji,iyyshim,,Go to commercial drive and walk a block or 2 down Grandview. Theres some folks set up there (when I was there a month ago) and it's dryish under the SkyTrain tracks..there's also some spots you can still access near Clark St and the bridge before. Not sure if you can still access under the SkyTrain by the tracks by VCC station. Used to sleep there and it was dry and fairly hiding.  Or trout Lake in the bushes. These are all within 5-8 blks of Broadway SkyTrain station. Or the community gardens down in Strathcona park was always a fav of mine as well(plus there's public bathrooms nearby.  Good luck

zcruji,izwumjy,,If you have any Mormon churches in the area, they have these spaces that you can go into. At least here in Utah they have them
zckkyg,iyx4eqm,,This question gets asked a lot and I always say to people who ask this:  Ask yourself what YOU would NEED if you were homeless or camping for an extended period of time. That's your answer. Think about what you would need to Survive on a winters night in a city when you know you have no where to sleep or stay warm. What would you personally do?  But to your points. 1: Food is really easy to come by as long as you don't care where you get it/find it. leftovers on the street, entire pizzas in dumpsters, starbucks dumpsters, etc. You have to be careful when providing snacks to people. think about allergies, think about how their teeth are. Many homeless people have really bad gums and teeth and can't eat what you normally eat. Apples? out of the question no way in hell I'd be able to eat an apple when I was homeless as I'd likely lose a tooth if I bit into one. Same with hard granola bars. Soft food is the best option if you want to provide snacks but really a snack isn't going to fill someones needed calory count for the day nor will it fix hunger. Trust me when you're homeless you're hungry 24/7.  2. Underarmor socks were great. Cheap socks will last a couple days at most. Really the only good quality socks are going to be over $20 for a pack. anything under $20 I guarantee you will be torn up in a week or two.  3. Not really.   4. no  5. Gift Cards. Giftcards to a 24 hour coffee shop even better. But grocery giftcards also. allows someone to buy what they know they can eat and get the most calories out of the food.  But yeah don't think things like this. Eating nutritious food isn't something that anyone, at least that I knew when I was homeless, even thinks about. It's about calories. The more the better because that's what will keep you moving throughout the day.
zckkyg,,iyxiaxm,Hey, thanks for the thorough answer I appreciate it. I did the snack thing with what I‚Äôd personally like last year and did cheez it but read a post on here that those aren‚Äôt necessarily the greatest since they‚Äôre not that high in calories and aren‚Äôt soft so I wanted to ask if there was preferences. I‚Äôll definitely think about this more and see what I come up with.   I hear you on the socks, I‚Äôll do my best. I read through some previous posts on this sub and your response so that gives me some good ideas. Thanks for writing all that out.  I didn‚Äôt even think about gift cards to grocery stores, that‚Äôs genius so I‚Äôll probably do that. It sounds like the best thing to do might be to do higher amounts in grocery gift cards so the individual person can decide what they like and maybe a couple things in the pack like socks. Thanks again!
zckkyg,,iz7p2fk,If a post like yours isn't stickied, it should be
zckkyg,iyyuwte,,I know this sounds crazy, but, apparently Chia is a high protein source. Maybe putting a chia pet in ea pack.
zckkyg,iz7oj57,,Dollar Tree has some decent quality socks, both men's and women's (in my local store you can get the men's in two pair and three pair packs, but the three pack is a bit harder to find. But if you order online, you can get what you want, but you need to buy a minimum number of packs.
zciue7,iyww9vg,,Food stamps
zciue7,iyx1znw,,The food pantries near me don't really let you "shop." They have premade boxes that they pass out. If you actually want to shop for your own food, apply for food stamps.
zciue7,iyxdgcr,,I feel like most people would prefer food stamps is it lets you keep your purchases fairly discreet and you get to shop and have dignity. Just shop like a normal person. It's unfair but there really is a stigma against people who shop at pantries that's kind of less than and it's unfair. And I say that is someone who's used pantries and also volunteers at my school pantry now. With food kitchens as good as they are they aren't really helpful to people with food intolerances like me being lactose intolerant and also gluten intolerance. There aren't many options for us. Food stamps allows me choice that I need for my medical issues
zciue7,iyyksjo,,Food stamps is better than a soup kitchen, but in an emergency it could save you.
zciue7,iywvjby,,What is a ‚Äúfood kitchen?‚Äù How does it differ from a food bank?
zciue7,,iywye29,They serve hot food
zciue7,,iyx03uh,Food kitchen give you the food to eat there and food bank gives you non personable food to eat later (my understanding, haven't used either yet but considering it to not destroy my savings on food when needed on car and other necessities that aren't taken care by social services)
zciue7,,iyzz632,So, you have never been to a food kitchen and are just assuming it's unhealthy? Or do you have some specific idea of what is/isn't healthy?  Your post says that kitchens "almost never have healthy choices," but how would you even know without trying?  Because I would think that any food kitchen is going to serve what is nutritionally considered to be a balanced meal with protein, vegetables, etc. It's not like they're serving pizza every night.
zciue7,,iyxnytv,The food banks in my city require a person to be registered and approved. Usually they are only open once or twice a month.   A food kitchen provides anyone who comes in a cooked meal no matter what their income is. Usually daily.
zciue7,,iz1d9gm,The food bank in my city is open to everyone 5 days a week, no questions asked. But you're only allowed to come once a week.   Then we also have pantries that hand out the boxes to people once a week but you have to register for that.
zciue7,,iz1fl0c,I love that! Unfortunately, I'm not approved at the best one in the city because I'm a sponsored permanent resident. Even though I'm no longer with my sponsor with no job currently. I'm working with the Y to find another where I'll be approved.
zciue7,,iz1gslz,They give you 4 empty grocery bags and let you shop for the food you want. Normally it's one bag filled with breads, one bag filled with produce, 1 bag for dessert (my favorite!) and also non-perishables and then one bag for meats/frozen goods.   But hobos call it angel food because you gotta listen to a church sermon before getting the food.
zciue7,,iz51itz,What city if you don't mind my asking? I live in Montr√©al. I've always found it homeless/low income friendly especially compared to cities in the US I've lived. There are a lot of food banks.   >angel food  I got a chuckle out of this. Most of the homeless people I've known have a good sense of humour.
zciue7,,iz57e8o,Raleigh, North Carolina
zciue7,iyxvea4,,Ok, I understand now. We don‚Äôt really have food kitchens where I live. There are a couple of shelters and at least one church that serve a meal. More commonly we have various outreach or volunteer groups that bring cooked meals to distribute at a common location like a park or they stop and distribute at a few of the larger encampments.   In my experience the food served in the shelters and a lot of what is passed out by outreach is very *institutional* and frankly pretty gross. I‚Äôm sure they are going for quantity over quality.   All in all I agree that food stamps/EBT/SNAP whatever you want to call it is the best way to go. A lot of people supplement that with one or two trips to the food bank.
zciue7,iz1crme,,Yes, they do offer healthier selections. They get fresh produce by the pallets and have farms dedicated solely to the food bank.   The National Guard came and worked on our farms during the quarantine.
zciue7,,iz1dk7e,A lot of people are getting the max amount on SNAP because of the pandemic. So people who only qualified for $15 per month have been getting like $270 per month since 2020 because of the national emergency.
zciijw,iyyttck,,I wear regular clothes, being homeless didn‚Äôt make me lose my sense of style. I had a girl ask me out today and I had to lie and say where I lived. Hopefully going on a date bc we bout to hit the dollar menu!!!!
zciijw,,izuyjt6,omg that makes me so happy
zciijw,iyxoema,,Durable outerwear is key, obviously make what money you have go as far as possible.  Online purchases are the hardest for me in a pinch when my reg bank acct is messed up. However, go online to the Rothco site and search up Ranger pantie. They're short pt shorts. They dry super fast, you can literally swim/shower in them and towel off and be dry, thereby cutting down on some of your laundry expenses. Get about 3 pairs. It'll cost you about 72bux online. Or, go to any Mil surplus store and search for the Rothco brand. Soffee is good too but not as opaque.
zciijw,iz02isy,,I would wear anything besides white if you can‚Äôt clean stuff regularly and yea people are going to treat you much worse if you look the ‚Äòbad‚Äô kind of homeless.
zciijw,iyxxnk0,,I wore the exact same stuff I currently wear (and previously wore) jeans, tank tops or tee shirts, hoodies, and sneakers. I‚Äôve never been into fashion or clothing trends, my basic look hasn‚Äôt changed since.. well *ever* really.
zciijw,iyycqar,,When I was homeless, I always had clean clothes. I would do what ever I had to do so I did not fit the stereotype or look homeless.
zciijw,iz6bjud,,I wear cool shirts and wash them when I can, importantly I wear a cheap undershirt every time to catch my sweat so my shirts don‚Äôt smell as quickly. Keep washing or replacing the undershirts they are cheap as hell
zciijw,izrewjg,,I‚Äôm In California so I can kind of get away with wearing pajamas pants and a big t shirt. I don‚Äôt look great but it‚Äôs comfy. I start my new job Tuesday though so I‚Äôll have to step it up to jeans and wearing a bra again üòë
zchal9,iyxc7z6,,I was homeless for 6 months a good chunk of that time in winter so it couldn't have been a worse scenario. I used to tarp in a hole in the middle to erect a kind of rough tent to put cardboard on the ground keep somewhat insulated and had a mylar blanket and a sleeping bag. As for washing up it was hell but luckily there was my library nearby and they had a single stall so I would literally take my products and sink shower pretty much daily. I'm pretty sure the library probably knew what I was doing since I would come out with wet hair but they let me do it because they knew me beforehand. It allowed me to keep my dignity by at least being presentable. People will still treat you overall decently if you look decent. I would store my dirty clothes in a garbage bag and when I got two full I go to the laundromat and wash my clothes. Sometimes I would have to collect bottles to have enough quarters to do my clothes but I managed.
zchal9,iyxxqxe,,off and on about 4 or 5 years now. currently homeless in LA since march, before that i was in oregon. i sleep wherever i can. sometimes bus, sometimes bench. i have a locker at the gym where i wash and shower before i go to work. i wash dishes for about 40-45 hours a week and take up extra gig work wherever i can. i finished my undergrad this past spring so am now just saving money taking things day by day.
zchal9,iyy4xru,,Currently homeless living in my car and I wash up with baby whips and sleep at my old job parking lot. I cope with sanity knowing this is for the best and I play clash of clans. My account is really good so getting on that helps with my shitty life
zchal9,iyx4y58,,I was homeless on and off for around 5 years. The most I'd spend outside was a few months at a time but I was mostly surviving in nature. Washing isnt impossible and easier in the summer. I used to go to this creek in the woods and bathe in it once every few days while the water was ice cold it was kinda nice considering the heat. I suppose any natural water source can be a bath if it's clean and not stagnant.
zchal9,iyyayt0,,The first time I panhandled to make ends meet. The 2nd time I had SSI at the time, so it helped. The third and final time, I sold newspapers all day, held signs on the weekend, and went to day labor, and that that allowed me to rent a small room that was horrible. Now I am a college grad, going for my degree in social work, and I have a job working with teens who have mental health issues and drug problems.
zchal9,iywo4a0,,I was street homeless (no vehicle or whatever) for 5 years. I slept/lived in many places. My favorite spot was under a bridge that had a concrete platform and it was divided into sections by concrete walls. They made perfect little rooms. We hung a curtain across the front and it was perfect. I‚Äôve also lived in tents in all sorts of locations, under freeway overpasses, hidden away behind sound walls, etc. I stayed in various abandoned buildings from time to time and even lived in an old traffic courthouse.   I can vividly remember brushing my teeth at a water fountain in a city park in the summer of 2015. I would bird bath in public restrooms, sometimes I would even wash my hair in the sink. I had a gym membership for a while but they went out of business. In the summer I would usually just shower at my spot. I would hang up a tarp like a shower curtain but making a full circle and then shower in there. I hated carrying water so I learned to be very efficient with it. I was able to fully shower and wash my hair with **one** gallon of water if necessary. For getting and storing water I had a couple of the 5 gallon water cooler jugs, you can find them in dumpsters behind businesses and apartments. I would take them in a shopping cart or a folding grocery cart to a nearby park and fill them up either at a water fountain (by filling a smaller bottle over and over, very tedious) or I would use a pair of pliers so I could use the hose spigot.   When you‚Äôre homeless you are almost always passively scouting resources. This becomes so ingrained that even now that I have been indoors for two years, I still find myself noticing outdoor water spigots and power outlets.  Edit to add: also having baby wipes on hand at all times was mandatory.
zchal9,,iyxyd1n,that babywipe tip needs to be in the how to be homeless 101 bible
zchal9,,iyywv2j,I used to joke that the two most clutch items when you‚Äôre homeless are baby wipes and febreeze. In a pinch you got your shower and clean clothes right there.
zchal9,,iyx1jux,> When you‚Äôre homeless you are almost always passively scouting resources. This becomes so ingrained that even now that I have been indoors for two years, I still find myself noticing outdoor water spigots and power outlets.  Oh man that's so true. Still to this day if I'm out walking around and I find something I think "oh I could probably use this for..." then I have to remind myself, again, I'm not homeless. This is especially true for Tarps. Every. single. time. I find a tarp I'm tempted to take it and I don't need it anymore.
zchal9,,iyx294o,I have **3** tents in my closet. You know, just in case. These were all acquired *after* I moved into my apartment. It doesn‚Äôt bother me though, if anything I know I‚Äôll be fine when society inevitably collapses.
zchal9,,iyxqmnx,[deleted]
zchal9,,iyxwgag,lol, you would have to pay the shipping (I‚Äôm only rich in tents) and at that point it would certainly be cheaper to just buy one.
zchal9,,iyxz7io,I appreciate the sentiment and well thought out your probably correct about just outright buying one
zchal9,,iyyx4ti,I have had good luck getting very cheap tents on craigslist, from thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, and from yard sales or flea markets. If you let people know you will be living in it you will usually get a good discount.
zchal9,,iyz0zqi,This was incredibly helpful Tysm! I‚Äôve never used Craigslist, if I buy something is it always guaranteed I‚Äôll get my proper item or money back??
zchal9,,iyz1xos,Lol, nope. Craigslist is buyer beware, no guarantees. It is strictly peer to peer cash based in person transactions. It is very possible to be swindled, though honestly I have done a lot of buying and selling there and never had any issues. Just use some basic common sense: meet in a public place, fully inspect the item before completing the transaction, always pay in cash in person, if anything seems off or shady it probably is. People who want to ship things to you or have weird requirements regarding payment are certainly scams. Buying something like a tent is pretty safe, most scams will be high ticket electronics or cars, etc.
zchal9,,iyyvxar,Hopefully you never need the tents for other than camping by choice.
zchal9,,iyxcor1,Boy do I hear this. Now I get super excited whenever I see camping equipment especially a really good tent or sleeping bag I'm like this is awesome I should totally get this even though I never go camping. Simply because I think Savannah if the power went out or whatever. This feeling of being prepared for the worst case scenario has led me to have a fully stocked medical cabinet which came in handy when I got really sick and my boyfriend did too. Power went out I had my super thermal sleeping bag it comes in handy sometimes
zchal9,,iyyvvbj,I think I notice the outdoor outlets a bit more now that I was homeless.
zchal9,iyxruco,,2 years. I stayed at a shelter, collected empties for money. The shelter was good for all hygiene needs.
zchal9,iyy1g0i,,I‚Äôm not homeless yet,.. but my Rent went up 18% last year. I‚Äôm almost certain its going to go up as much (or more) next year.   Employer is only promising us COL (Cost Of Living) raises of 2.5%  Inflation, Food and Housing prices are through the roof.   I‚Äôm seriously considering living in my Car.
zchal9,,iyydkn0,Think about trading the car for a van if considering that.
zchal9,,iyyis8w,Trade the car for a van or SUV. Trust me
zchal9,iyy1knj,,Off and on I've struggled with homelessness even as a child. But on my own I was homeless for almost the whole last 13 years. Been housed about 6 months now, in independent, but rent reduced, housing.  I had ssi a lot of the time I was on the streets, and if not, I was working temp jobs here and there, including offering to cook and clean in exchange for floor space or couch nights occasionally with friends. But with ssi, I could go off grid for some time if I so wanted, and just do extended camping similar to what I'd do if I was housed, and nobody would be able to tell I was homeless just by looking at me.  Living in populated areas however, I always had a storage unit, bus pass, library card, 24 hour gym membership, did movie pass for awhile, Cafe and restaurant subscription or rewards programs come in handy as well.  Living month to month on disability isn't enough to put down deposit on a place plus first month's rent depending on location, but it was enough I could have stuff to do throughout the day, and warm dry places to be. I also learned how to be resourceful with getting free laundry and foodstuffs that I'd be happy to explain if someone wants to know, just pm me.   If not for ssi, I'd likely had just done like that one guy did, Rob a bank for a dollar and wait for the cops. It's damn near impossible to get a job while homeless and keep it, and fuck being completely penniless, I've done it before, but not something I ever plan on again.
zchal9,iyyvr32,,I was homeless just a little over a year.  For roughly half that, I lived in two homeless shelters.  But for the other half, I lived outside. For my sanitary needs, there was a 'water closet' at the Friendship center that had a big plastic sink and a water hose to wash anything with (yourself, clothes...). There was a closeable door so you could get naked if you wanted. It was generally assumed if the door was closed, it was in use.    Monday to Friday from roughly 830am to 2pm or so. On Weekends, there was a baptist church that had an outdoor water faucet that I would use to wash- it was outdoors with no privacy, so I stayed clothed.   As for the sanitary needs as a female of childbearing years, I would cut apart a old piece of clothing and use bits of that. When I didn't have access to a private toilet, I'd just switch them out with a new piece, and put them in a Walmart bag to throw away (the next morning usually). I'd also try to have a pack of baby wipes handy for times like that.  For the time spent sleeping outside, 90% of it was under a bridge that had church services every Saturday morning. The other 10% was in a more public place when my 'roommate' checked into a shelter- since I was in Texas I *was* breaking the law, but I felt safer there since I could more easily get help from there if needed.
zchal9,iz025s8,,I‚Äôm homeless now and have been off and on for many years
zchal9,izrf252,,On and off for about a year. Slept in my friend‚Äôs car and had a 24 he forbids gym pass to shower and keep warm. It‚Äôs a stuggle especially when u lose sleep
zc95w8,iywx180,,Just commenting to say to all the scammers:  You are DISGUSTING for trying to get my information, especially knowing I‚Äôm homeless. Idk why I keep getting my hopes up. It stings every time
zc95w8,iyx30m7,,Friend, you're doing more than enough.  Time to stop beating on yourself.  As another user pointed out, we should have a system to prevent people from becoming homeless, like they do in so many other (poorer!) countries.  Your didn't create your situation, and the fact that you haven't found your way out yet isn't on you.  [Luck alone dictates 80% of our outcomes](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/03/01/144958/if-youre-so-smart-why-arent-you-rich-turns-out-its-just-chance/).  You're applying to jobs and applying for SNAP and asking for help.  You're doing just fine, effort-wise.  Here are some links to info about food banks in Miami:  * [https://www.foodpantries.org/ci/fl-miami](https://www.foodpantries.org/ci/fl-miami) * [https://www.foodbanks.net/miami-fl/](https://www.foodbanks.net/miami-fl/) * [Yelp's 10 best food banks in Miami](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=foodbanks&find_loc=Miami%2C+FL)  Those should be able to get you over the hump while you're waiting for SNAP to kick in.  This last suggestion is guaranteed to annoy, but I promise it comes from a place of science.  Once you've secured enough to eat, make sure you get some exercise everyday!  Exercise will boost your energy levels and you'll feel less depressed.  If you like animals, check out one of the [animal shelters](https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=animalshelters&find_loc=Miami%2C+FL).  Oftentimes the staff are happy to let people hang out with some dogs and cats for a while.  Can be a good source of happy brain chemicals (oxytocin).  Keep your head up!  You will make it out of this.
zc95w8,,iyx9yka,You guys have beautiful souls. Seriously. It may seem silly but these words help me *tremendously*. Thank you for the links.   80%? Now i gotta read that.  Not annoying at all. You‚Äôre 100% right. I actually lost 100 lbs at one point. I was scary depressed and it was a last ditch effort to keep my head above water. It felt **amazing** and I got addicted to it. I didn‚Äôt miss a day for over 6 months. That high is *chef kiss*
zc95w8,iyvfbrc,,Terrible. If it's only financial hardship in your case, this should be federally funded to help you. Miami must be a nightmare now for existence. Last time i was there was in '05.
zc95w8,,iywxdsl,Yeah. Its rough out here. But I‚Äôm in a car, so I have it better than a lot of people here. I‚Äôm applying for an EBT card and disability. Wish it didn‚Äôt take so long.
zc95w8,,iyx2y17,The disability fund will be depleted soon.
zc95w8,,iyx8ld6,._. Well that sucks.
zc95w8,,iyx9vnb,ok so if you can work and do DD are you really disabled? and are you preparared to live on that tiny amount given monthly?? Unless I was in a wheelchair and or totally immobile, blind, deaf, or battling stage cancer I would be better off working.
zc95w8,,iyxc2el,I want disability as supplemental income. I‚Äôm still going to work and hustle (one thing miami‚Äôs great for). I hope I can still have it if I‚Äôm working minimum wage.  My ‚Äúdisabilities‚Äù are mental. For the longest i didnt think it was a disability. But the more I learn about myself, the more I understand why my therapist teared up when I was telling her about myself. I left that room years ago wondering why tf she was so sad. Why she was saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry you have to go through that.‚Äù I was literally just talking about my everyday life.  Its scary how much you can get used to.
zc95w8,,iyxcfth,I would like disability as a supplemental income as well, except for one thing. I‚Äôm not disabled. I have problems like everyone else but I work through them and I have no choice to. Otherwise I‚Äôd be homeless. I work I work manage my money wisely, and I have no choice but to make it work. You need to change your mindset instead if you‚Äôre waiting on a disability check, go out and get a job and make better choices.  Instead of driving on suspended licenses and no insurance.
zc95w8,,iyxf3qi,I want to do everything i can to get back on my feet again *and* get disability. I‚Äôll be truthful on the forms, if they think i deserve it then cool, if not, cool. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt rely on disability, or any other govt funds.   This is why I was down on myself in the post. This shit is in my head, why tf do i give into it so much. I shouldn‚Äôt still be out here. I was letting myself go without food for over 24 hrs simply bc i didnt want to leave my car. Peeing in cups for the same reason. Sometimes life is just. Too much. Sometimes I shut down. Maybe it‚Äôs an excuse. I don‚Äôt know. But I promise I‚Äôm trying.
zc95w8,iyvhp0z,,Everything in life is going to take a lot longer than you think it will.   Look at what you have going for you, even in this situation.   Life is a chaotic random adventure. It's ok to feel like shit sometimes, but feeling bad because you haven't stuck to some idea of what life is supposed to be is pointless. There is no right way to do it.  Reading a book, even a shitty one, can be a godsend for keeping the shitty thoughts at bay.  It's ok to just do what you can and say fuck it to the rest. You need some downtime. Being out here is really draining.  As a guy with a really thick accent once said, "You must have hapenis in your life." I'm pretty sure he meant happiness, but that makes me laugh everytime I think about it.  Keep on keeping on. Good Luck!
zc95w8,,iyvi3ki,P.s Miami is a rough place to be homeless. I hear west palm beach is the place to be in Florida.  P. P. S. Find some churches, missions, food banks near you for food. Go to as many as you can get to. Food and little socializing can go a long way.
zc95w8,,iywr3yo,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è. I keep forgetting it‚Äôs okay. I needed to hear that
zc95w8,iywq376,,You haven't let yourself down. Everyone needs help now and then. It your turn now.  I became homeless because of depression. I lost my job during COVID, couldn't afford counseling or medication, and stopped functioning. I was evicted and ended up in a homeless shelter. I hated it, but it provided food and shelter, and it gave me a place to get away from the day-to-day stresses of caring for myself.   After a couple of months, I pulled myself together enough to start job hunting again. I landed a good job, moved out of the shelter, got back on meds and found a great counselor. I'm not cured, but I'm closer to normal than I have been in a while.  That's what worked for me. It may not work for you, but may be worth trying. See if you can find a shelter so you won't have to worry about the day-to-day things like eating and showering. Ask the staff for help getting in to see a doctor or other healthcare provider who can prescribe antidepressants. They take a while to work, but can be real life savers.   Above all, stop kicking yourself. I know that's hard, but it doesn't help anything and could make you even more depressed. This is your chance to start over and make your life what you want it to be.   Good luck!
zc95w8,,iywvj0u,Shelters scare tf outta me. Miami is‚Ä¶not the most friendly place. But you‚Äôre right. They can‚Äôt all be bad. Working up the nerve to go to one is embarrassingly difficult for me.
zc95w8,iyvyoso,,Why was license revoked? Apply retail..fast food...any one of those will hire you.
zc95w8,,iywuqir,Yeah, I‚Äôve been applying to restaurants near me. I couldnt afford insurance. The cops caught me driving with a suspended license while I was doing Doordash. Took both my license and license tag. I gotta get a whole new registration & everything.
zc95w8,,iyx9gs1,I am surprised DD let you do it without proof of insurance of course if you pay monthly DD doesnt stay on top of these monthly . Live in your car for a few months at least you have that. Once the car gets towed or impounded you will be even more screwed. Take any job that will hire you but you should try to park on private  property somewhere with permission so your car doesnt get impounded.  If you cannot afford insurance, then you really have no choice but to sell the car pocket whatever money you get after paid off. maybe rent a room for a few months and start all over again
zc95w8,,iyxauhy,When i signed up for dd, i had insurance. Then I started using my sister‚Äôs. üò¨ (just jk dd)  Thankfully I‚Äôve found a good place to sleep and a good place to park my car when I‚Äôm gone overnight. Fam I‚Äôm applying to subway, anything around here. Idc if it‚Äôs minimum wage.
zc95w8,iyygijg,,If i were there, I'd head to key west, get a fishing pole and a small grill, and get a job cleaning tables, and other odd jobs. Or go to the Gold Coast side. FL can be a brutal place to be homeless, but there are places which are very open to people who are trying.  You should also go to indeed.com and search for Keller Williams and Kaiser technical college Real Estate licensing course. It's free. It's a lot of really boring information, but once you get licensed, you can either work as a realtor or a home inspector, or both. It's what I'm working on. It's probably the best plan to get out of being homeless.

zc95w8,,iywv6qg,No. I should have, but haven‚Äôt yet. Idk why it makes me so anxious but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs for a shallow reason. And yes, I‚Äôm fortunate to have my car. Although gas + food = ~$1,200/month.
zc95w8,,iyx76ns,Really it's that expensive down there? I am from Finland and get by with probably less than 500‚Ç¨/month. Probably need a bit more now that the winter is here, for heating mostly.
zc95w8,,iyxahon,Wow. I wish?? Here in Miami I‚Äôd be lucky to get a small room in someone‚Äôs apartment for that price. Alone.  I was shocked too, the first time I did the math. It makes no financial sense to be out here. Which is ironic. I can stretch $20 into 3 meals, and another $20 goes into gas if im using the car for a lot of the day or throughout the night (a/c). $40 x 30 = $1,200. Its crazy.
zc95w8,,iyxc3vk,That's crazy man. I can get a meal for about 80-90 cents. But I do live in a house, so I can store frozen veggies and meatballs in my freezer, and eggs in the fridge.
zc95w8,,iyxdlp1,Fam. I have fantasized about getting a fridge for several months now. I‚Äôd sleep on an air mattress and use that money for one lol. I could 1. Save a ton of money, and 2. Eat healthy again. I eat at a gas station and it‚Äôs $4-5 minimum. It‚Äôs the junkiest food and so bad for my body. If I wanna be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù i gotta spend more.
zc95w8,,iyybvhd,Check out Walmart. They have prepackaged salads and sandwiches for around $5. Some grocery stores have prepackaged wraps, sandwiches and pasta for a bit more. They also usually have a microwave you can use to heat up your meals.

There are also power outlets you can use and public restrooms for the beach.   The funny this is I work hard in a warehouse so I‚Äôm either in shorts just chilling at the beach or im in boots and jeans.   I figured out for me I just need a place to be lazy at and not worry every second. I have that at the moment sorta at this spot at the beach.

I work everyday I can and still have had been homeless, even with a job. Todays society is based on family and/or offspring, if you don't have any than your worthless, even with a job. But that in my own opinion.   Idk if you think im a hobo, a wanderer, a suitcase man, or anything you wanna call me or think of me while I'm on the streets, all I know is that when im working im making money for me and not none of these money hungry, wallet biting, pocket book munching mother fos while I live on the streets, or even concrete jungle surviving.

I get a small Social Security check but I couldn‚Äôt afford to live anywhere on that. At the time I was living with my ex-boyfriend and his family. Things went south in the relationship, he started getting physical with me, eventually his family kicked us out.

Not all of us have mentors w the capacity to properly guide us towards a productive path. I chose the Army, but st√≠l lacked certain interpersonal and organizational skills needed to maintain a career there. I chose Motorcycle technology as a vocational skill, not knowing 90% of those hired are hired by family and friends, which i have none in that field. I suck at math, so no cashier/money handling jobs.  I am now at the age where I'd rather disappear into the woods than associate with the majority of the stupid mfrs on this planet, but i have Child Support and i actually care about my offspring.

zc0o2r,iyv36yw,,i love how out of 4 possible reasons you listed, none of them were rising rent costs or wage stagnation. not even the very obvious global pandemic made it onto your very short and ignorant list.
zc0o2r,iyy337l,,Well... I needed to care for my dad who had dimentia. I moved from my apartment to his house in another state, and so I had to change jobs. I didn't make as much as my last job, but I was going to be living there, so I thought the difference in wages lost would be made up by not having to pay for rent. Of all my siblings, I was making the least and I was the youngest with no kids so it made sense that I take the responsibility.   So, things are humming along for a little under a year and then my dad, while going for a walk, fell and broke his hip. This was really the start of the end. The medical bills were piling up and his dementia grew very bad. He eventually healed but his mental state was very bad. I had to stay with him longer and longer and all the while my debts grew because I wasn't able to work as much and his medical expenses grew. Now, he owned his house outright and it was agreed between me and my siblings and my father that because I was taking it upon myself alone to take care of him, I would be the sole owner of the house when he passed. (You can see where this is going). So, two years later I am deep in debt, but I'm not worried because I can sell the house and salvage my life. Dad dies. My siblings immediately contest my dad's will saying he was not in his right mind when he wrote it. I have no real money to hire an attorney. I go into a pretty deep depression after having my brothers and sister basically turn on me all for a piece of dad's house. It sells, I get one fifth of the proceeds which doesn't cover all the debt I'm in. Depression gets worse, I stay with a friend until I wear out my welcome (not her fault, I basically stayed in bed for three months and had crying fits around her children). I stayed in a shelter and basically had everything stolen. Lost my IDs, documents, but I didn't care. I was sexually assaulted several times, but I was numb to the world. I just didn't care. I eventually wandered down from Washington to Oregon where some nice people took care of me. Then a new person joined the group and things got ugly. Made my way down to California and I'm here now.   So, yeah. That's my story. It's not that rare. A lot of people are one medical emergency from being in financial trouble. It doesnt have to be drugs or alcohol or mental illness or whatever else people think of us. I've meet people who lost it all over a broken wrist, a fire, all it takes is for one domino to fall and then...

zc0o2r,iz1ld70,,For me, it was leaving a toxic relationship, and having to build a life on my own. I had to move away from the city I was in, leave my decent salary job behind, and stay with family. The extreme stress and undiagnosed PTSD made it impossible to get hired anywhere, and gradually money and resources just ran out. Also, getting off of antidepressants and benzodiazepines, which are some of the most difficult withdrawal symptoms.  I'm back on my feet now, but those events set me back for about 5 years of nomadic life. I think for a lot of people, it's a snowball of bad luck in a short amount of time. You end up in a ditch that's near impossible to climb out of.

There‚Äôs also many jobs that are very fast paced and physically exhausting on the body like construction which can take a toll on your body. People wanna know why people are entitled well it‚Äôs because of things like this. If you‚Äôre also disabled mentally in any way shape or form, the system easily works against you.

He's a toxic manipulator and threatened her with divorce when she brought me back.  The system is broken [by design], and from what I observed and heard personally, the social services are inadequate at best, at worst a joke.

zc0o2r,iyz3og5,,In my area the best paying jobs are $18/hr (most are $12-14/hr) while the lowest rent is $1500/month.. My body couldn't handle working 60-80 hours a week anymore to just sleep and store my stuff in a leaky rat infested apartment and struggling to do that. All while my sleazy landlord who literally lives in a mansion in the richest city in the state kept raising the rent so he could go on lavish vacations around the world with his trophy wife (yes, I checked his Facebook profile to find that out, lol).   The last straw for me was one night I heard a rat scratching and chewing inside the wall right next to a power outlet. The next morning I woke up and saw rat feces on the pillow next to me and realized I was better off putting all my stuff in storage and just sleeping in my car. So that's where I am now. I'm sick of breaking my back just for some rich pos to reap all the benefits.  In this area there's zero help for the poor. No shelters, no public transit. Nothing. And on top of that the police actively keep the homeless population away. They run off people sleeping in their cars (like me) and will even pick up those without transportation and drop them off at the city/county line and tell them to not come back. Mind you that's usually out in the middle of nowhere and this area still has a known sizable population of coyotes and even the occasional mountain lion.

I‚Äôm insecurely housed so I stay with someone but it‚Äôs out of necessity and not choice. I‚Äôm just afraid of being out on streets homeless. I have complex ptsd and possible borderline personality disorder, and these conditions can be improved but probably not without intense ongoing therapy for like a year or more. I feel I would need to be supervised and having ongoing care until I feel like I can manage alone or being independent enuf to no longer need oversight to manage my everyday stuff. I do use substances to some degree to manage my ability to function although I do try not to overuse anything because it isn‚Äôt to get high, but only to improve mind state to function. Because of all the issues I have, I thought I didn‚Äôt deserve to have kids and so I lost all of mine to abortions üòî this weighs on me a lot too. The feeling like in our society if u can‚Äôt get mental health care u feel pressure to abort your kids, out of fear they won‚Äôt have a decent future either. I wish I had given up for adoption.

zc0o2r,iz2i7ew,,It was only a matter of time before inflation outpaces the ability to pay rent or afford cost of living. The push to force most people into renting is not by accident. This country was not intended to be a nation of renters but many people have no other choice now. Which means that they are not free. You have that hanging over your head constantly, worrying about something as basic as a residence nobody can throw u out of. Imagine how much theft occurs from pple who rent. All that money they could use to buy a small plot of land and a small home they could have afforded but can‚Äôt because they make it a crime to be poor, forcing u to rent making other pple rich while u are paying for your premature death thru eventual homelessness bc of having to give most of your earnings to landlords in your prime healthy years.

I got involved in inhalants, thats when things got a bit rocky some legal trouble lost a few jobs, but still held it together and was getting sober when all hell broke loose.  My addiction problem was almost entirely a byproduct of severe depression and bipolar, 3 years ago they changed my medication and I had about the worst possible side effects sending me into a psychotic break with hallucinations, during this I assaulted someone which I have no memory of, they continued to give me the medication in jail for 2 weeks during which I continued to hallucinate and didn't even know I was in jail.  Finally they pulled my meds and I came out of it.  Because of my history the courts wouldn't believe in the psych issue and I ended up with a felony.  Once I got out of jail everything I had was gone and I had no job nowhere to go.  I bounced around halfway houses and finally a transitional housing/rehab that i currently reside in.

zc0o2r,j0lri8x,,I've been on veterans compensation for about 11 years now. The rate at which I am paid I suppose to be above poverty level, at the lower end of middle class, but with the current economy it's more around half of what the local poverty level is. After the COVID restrictions were lifted, landlords in Lynchburg, VA were evicting people to renovate and raise rent. The last apartment I rented was nearly condemned, with the windows falling out, little to no insulation, full of bugs and not in a good area. When the renter offered me another apartment, it was worse and nearly 60% more expensive. That would have been the third apartment from this landlord, the first one had leaking pipes and a puddle on the floor that you couldn't keep dry and fungi growing out of the walls. Putting in a work order to get anything fixed was a waste of time. Simply put, I am better off living out here in a tent. The rental market is not for renters.
zc0o2r,iyv146c,,as for asking ppl if they are homeless because they didn‚Äôt feel like working a lot, based on a study from 2021 that linked the data from a 2010 census on the homeless population in the U.S. with available data on benefits and taxes, more than half of sheltered homeless adults under 65 and 40% of unsheltered homeless ppl worked at some point in that year (2010). you can read a summary of a few of the points [here](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/employment-alone-isnt-enough-solve-homelessness-study-suggests) and click through to the entire report from there. if these numbers still feel low to you, i‚Äôd ask you to imagine trying to find/ hold down a job while also having to think about where you‚Äôre going to sleep or how safe you‚Äôre going to be that day instead of coming home after a long day.

zbzi4m,,iywbwqm,This question feels very confrontational, not sure if that‚Äôs your intention. But no, of course not everyone would go, because shelters aren‚Äôt a good fit for *everyone.* For me personally a traditional shelter would not have been a good fit for a variety of reasons. For one thing shelters don‚Äôt allow you to be there during the day. I have a disability and need to rest frequently, so hauling all my stuff to a shelter every night just to haul it all back in the morning is not a solution for me.
zbzi4m,,iywq4t3,Absolutely not confrontational. I want to be informed. I seem to have been blessed with a great shelter in a safe rich county. I wanted to learn more what others deal and suffer with. I won lie, I don't enjoy 'living' in a wealthy prosperous suburb of a major city. I want to travel and see America but the reality that I may face leaving what little good I have makes me pause if it means going downhill from here. And this emergency shelter is a drop in day center for homeless to eat, shower, relax, watch TV, use computers and wifi, and have case workers. So this shelter is beyond anything I've ever heard and stumbled on.   Life is about compromise and priorities and values. I'm only having sincerely and with no ill will
zbzi4m,,iywqjbs,I didn‚Äôt mean *your* question was confrontational, I meant the one to which I was directly replying.
zbzi4m,iyu0uvl,,in the states, many many shelters have unreasonable requirements and are themselves pretty dangerous places. if its not a religious based non profit banning trans folk, addicts, and anyone that doesnt fit their standards then its a state run facility that is majorly understaffed and underfunded. imo, the question to be solved is why are shelters so bad that people dont wanna use them?
zbzi4m,,iyu1ak3,Wow good point. I just had to be check for a sex offender list. Everyone seems lovely here's even kids are running around safely. I'm def blessed and have to be thankful, I see your point. Literally the main police station and massive fire/rescue company is across the road, feels super safe
zbzi4m,iyuhc7b,,With a lot of shelters, you literally have to stand outside in a line for up to like 8 hours and then you still might get turned away at the end of it all. It isn't always easy to get in. I've also been to a women's shelter where they would turn away any woman who couldn't successfully prove they were being abused (honestly wtf)  Also, not all shelters are safe. Depending on a person, some people could actually be too weak or disabled to get themselves there. Also, some may not know about it. Personally, I'm from a place where this isn't a thing so I don't know but point being, there's always reasons.
zbzi4m,iyuyowr,,People don‚Äôt feel safe! People steal like it‚Äôs Normal. Also they will get kicked out for being high/drugs
zbzi4m,,iyv2ix8,How to avoid being robbed? I was thinking of getting a travel hidden poach that goes under your cloths to hide my stuff. Good idea to prevent people going into pocket while sleeping?   Luckily my shelter is by a massive police station, everytime I look out the windows cops pass by. And the place does sex offender and criminal checks since kids freely come and run around the shelter. Feels super safe. Would be nice if they checked for alcohol/drugs/weapons and not just temperature, though ..
zbzi4m,iyv8ihg,,Some homeless have dogs and shelters won‚Äôt take pets.
zbzi4m,,iyw42wg,Exactly I went through that before I ended up sleeping in my car. 4 yrs later I had to find a place not too expensive it's pretty nice
zbzi4m,iyudx5f,,Some don't deal well with the structure or the other people in the shelters.    I've known someone who spent an entire winter outside because he didn't like the people he had to interact with the prior season.  And this was at a pretty tame shelter.  I told him about the atmosphere during the current season, but prior experiences were enough to keep him out.  This thermal shelter was largely non-preachy but a lot of the unpaid volunteers were from churches and wanted to chat.    I hated seeing him with a wind burned face looking cold, but it was his choice.  Edit: there were also specific times people had to be places and that conflicted with more than one person's ability to stay in the shelter.  Working a 3rd shift basically made you unable to take advantage of the program.
zbzi4m,iyvzyca,,Because homeless shelters are about like prisons.  There's plenty of very mentally ill people, plenty of dangerous drug addicts, plenty of aggressive gang members.  Fights are very common, thefts are very common, even stabbings, rapes, and murder  In nearly all cases, most homeless prefer the streets.  &#x200B;  In the defense of the homeless shelter's employees, they're usually hugely understaffed and don't have the people needed to keep the peace.  The government notoriously underfunds any service that impoverished people use, in order to discourage its use.  Homeless shelters try to make up for being underfunded by having volutneers help, but most volunteers get scared away from it after one shift.  &#x200B;  America definitely needs to do better with their homeless shelters.
zbzi4m,iywmjo9,,Because most are full, and your surrounded by mentally ill,usually poly addicts, there's a lot of violence,thefts,disease,bugs and have fun sleeping in a room with 40+ other strangers. And most won't take pets either...many reasons. I NEVER used shelters when I was homeless. Just learnt how to survive in cold weather without dying.
zbzi4m,,iywn8nk,I can't survive outside .. and the shelter is really well funded and right by county police headquarters, it is in one the wealthiest county in America. If I leave my stuff outside and only bring in myself (and clothes) and just sleep (with ear plugs and eye blinds), shower with free toiletries and dip out, would it be safer and work better? I keep to myself, and notice the unstable people only go off when you stare at them, for what it's worth .. I'm far from the big city and the people here seem more super class in bad circumstances vs serious mental health issues or criminals. Kids freely roam with men and women in the shelter. And always supervised by staff 24/7 with cops literally seconds away. Idk, maybe I hit the winter shelter jackpot? No clue what I'll do once April works
zbzi4m,iyuux4v,,The two shelters I stayed in had a limit of 3 months at a time, and there was a wait of three months I think from when you left and could go back (maybe six? I can't remember).   The only time I know of there was 'emergency' help was when there was a foot of snow on the ground for the better part of a week. The Salvation Army shelter I was at set up cots in the dining area, and we (the 'regular' residents) could stay inside and didn't have to leave during the day like usual)
zbzi4m,iyv37eo,,Some choose to sleep on the streets, in a shelter you have rules to follow some don't want to follow rules. Also there might not be any beds the shelters they are full. it's a terrible situation
zbzi4m,iyvjs44,,My county requires a shelter obligation and takes 80% of whatever income you have (be the from a job, SSI or SSDI etc). People often avoid them because there is no way to save up to exit homelessness paying a shelter 80% of your income.  People also avoid shelters because they can‚Äôt bring their pet, or partner (if they aren‚Äôt married they aren‚Äôt placed together).  And then all the other reasons folks listen. Shelters are hit and miss here, nearly all fail to provide any real case management despite that being part of their contract with the county.
zbzi4m,iyubms0,,Shelters are jail for the homeless
zbzi4m,,izgrxci,Can you elaborate?
zbzi4m,iyybanr,,I think people assume shelters have open beds. Shelters here are full and have long waiting lists.
zbzi4m,iyu6mad,,Some shelters are full of drugs and violence, unpredictable behaviour often comes from mental health issues/drugs.
zbzi4m,,iyv51tl,The mental ward was traumatic but at least drugs/alcohol and weapons were banned. I can see shelters been even worst in some places.
zbzi4m,iyvxzqv,,Some prefer it sadly. I was in a shelter but hit when it was cold. Still a lot of them don‚Äôt like the aspect of being around a lot of people and the small risk factors it can bring.
zbzi4m,,iyvzpme,Small risk factors?
zbzi4m,,iyw3dlv,Yeah some cats in the shelter steal your shit, some people just start drama, some people just don‚Äôt do well with others. So they prefer solitude and or just coming to the shelter for food. I‚Äôve seen people get a spot and str8 just stay out for a few days doing whatever. Plus I mean some people don‚Äôt respect space, had a guy underneath my bunk watching some weird violent type of porn and it was like 2 am you could hear it in the wholeee dorm. Like there‚Äôs a bathroom there man wtf. I‚Äôve had people almost but tf up no pun intended, but cause I wouldn‚Äôt give them a cig.
zbzi4m,iywlewr,,Shelters suck. I've said it on here before: I'd rather got to jail than a shelter
zbzi4m,iyx28ba,,I was once told buy a homeless man that he comes out worse than he went in, so he doesn‚Äôt go anymore. You go in with shoes and a coat‚Ä¶sometimes you come out without those things. Very sad.
zbzi4m,iyu54eb,,The shelters here in the US will kick people out for stupid reasons. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs people sleeping outside. I took in my 2 friends (they‚Äôre a couple) who was living with someone that kept getting in trouble with the police and was evicted. They had 5 days to find a place. They would‚Äôve been on the streets. They have stayed at shelters and they were really nervous about living like that again. Thank goodness they work
zbzi4m,iyujbbk,,Shelters have bed bugs
zbzi4m,iywoqhv,,Mainly because they do not wish to follow the rules of the shelter. OP mentioned specifically when shelter WAS available.
zbzi4m,iyx4o60,,I can‚Äôt be around the other people . I‚Äôm not into confrontation and I don‚Äôt wanna have to wonder what‚Äôs happening once I fall asleep. I can easily be sent off by toxic people. So it‚Äôs best to avoid it all together
zbzi4m,,iyx7cwd,Habs you been before and had experience with toxic people? What happened and howd you recommend someone who has to be in the shelter to react or avoid bad experiences?
zbzi4m,,iyx99v7,Stay to yourself and have zero possessions. No money . Play broke . And don‚Äôt make friends. Leave once you wake and return just to sleep.
zbzi4m,iyxpxze,,There is plenty of room in the shelters we spent the summer in Phoenix. Most people prefer to live in tents on the zone because you cannot drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or fentanyl/meth. That is the truth. My man and don‚Äôt drink or smoke anything so we stayed inside. People get kicked out constantly by breaking the rules and fighting/stealing.
zbzi4m,iyvq7fq,,Shelters don't tend to take pets so people with pets can't use them.  Some people require their pets for emotional support.  Also they are over run.  Where I live there aren't any shelters yet.  There are some 15-30 minutes away by car on a good traffic day.  The first soup kitchen showed up in 2015 in my county/city.  They are currently looking into finding space for a homeless shelter.
zbzi4m,iyxaz7i,,Safety... hygiene issues... fighting...items stolen...not safe
zbzi4m,iyy03jf,,some may be self reliant and not want to be part of a homeless industrial complex that will demand personal information and adherence to their rules.  Also fresh air > shared indoor air
zbzi4m,iyz0tqv,,shelters can be somewhat violent places - you might lose your possessions, or worse.  shelters also have restrictions on what chemical substances you can bring in.
zbzi4m,iziw34m,,There are a lot 9f homeless people this has been going on for years it hasn't just started. Shelters are never going to change, key word*homeless*. All across the country someone has fallen on hard times whatever or however it happens. I was reading some comments I don't know about everywhere but some make you drop if they suspect drugs usage, if you are a sex offender why even go to a shelter go on, be for real. What people don't realize is the majority of homeless people used to be somebody before homeless happened to them. Just because you are homeless doesn't make you an alcoholic or drug addict. And that's the problem that's why homeless people are treated like trash, give them left over food from the day before or don't care if the shelters are clean and safe. What I want to do is fight, fight for all homeless people. You have black lives matter, white lives matter, LGBT lives matter, everyone matter accept homeless people. When I get into a home that on my list is to form a committee to fight for the homeless we are people too. Don't get me wrong but the energy that was used to bring Brittany home could have been used towards the ones who need it. Heck some people have been living on the streets 9 years that's prison alone right there. Why do people turn their heads on homeless or talk down to them. Homeless lives matter too.
zbzi4m,izrhc3z,,Shelters are for profit doesn't matter if they say nonprofit that is a lie they are paid so it's a biessness making money on others misfortune
zbxxnw,iyualye,,I'm glad you're warm üòä
zbxxnw,,iyv4fg8,Thanks! Was nice to lie down and get out of the cold. Being in a recliner car was horrible. Then I found a very decent shelter. Didn't sleep well, chalk it up to first time nerves. Eye blinds ear plugs and more warm clothes will def help make it easier to sleep. Though even with the heat and three covers it was cold! May sleep in my big jacket and a beanie and gloves and extra socks. Any advice to keep warm even with the place is heated and younger covers? I may just be too lean to keep my hear in lol
zbxxnw,,iyvg2vi,Get some long johns for under your clothes
zbxxnw,iyutqnu,,Omg did they give you a brand new pillow? That's fucking awesome!!!
zbxxnw,iyuii0b,,Sleep well üò¥
zbxxnw,iyuaolh,,Is that a Cheeto in the bed
zbxxnw,,j0ka34f,Looks very much like a cheeto! - lol.
zbxxnw,iyuowlr,,Hypothermia shelter?
zbxxnw,,iyvhg42,It‚Äôs usually called a warming station I actually work for one as well as their extension which is a actual homeless shelter in NY
zbxxnw,,iyuwngi,Probably one that only opens up during very cold temps
zbxxnw,,iyv4efd,That makes sense. Thank you. I had never heard that term before.
zbxxnw,,iyw8jfb,I thought they meant like the small shed like shelters that are as small or smaller than a jail cell but safe and warm or cool.
zbxxnw,iztrmiz,,Use indeed and LinkedIn and just keep applying for work, save up a few paychecks and hopefully you‚Äôll get back on your feet
zbxxnw,iz322fq,,This looks rough bro. Try a shelter
zbxxnw,,iz34c8l,They are full and only thing is overflow hypothermia. Food, laundry, restroom, park car spot, cot with sheets. Trying to find some gratefulness in all this low point and low point
zbxxnw,,iz34mqx,Yeah bro that that depends where you're located. Different states and cities have different qualifications and regulations and rules and stuff about obtaining shelter. Keep trying be creative something will workout. Maybe try different city if the one you're at becomes to difficult. There is definitely a shelter so where that will take you in.
zbxxnw,,iz7e46r,Thanks to God for this!! prayers things get better!
zbxxnw,,iz7er67,Trying to be grateful I found a good place, safe, relatively clean, out of the cold, showers, etc. Not ideal but not on concrete in the big city. Thanks for your prayers, very kind and heartwarming having you rotting for me!
zbxxnw,,iz8ifur,I think you are quite intelligent for seeking this hypothermia center , too many people refuse to go (and I dont know why) like you said its clean and warm.  Seek out churches also, there are some good people there and you might be able to get a room with a member or something like that .  Stick with Jesus , he is the change.
zbxxnw,,iz96ifc,Thanks for your compliments! I actually went to a nice church right across the street, lots of people and a good sermon. Was new and a bit timid so didn't meet anyone but was nice being around people and in church. How to ask for help? Still in shock of my situation and never asked for help, always supported myself since leaving home at 17 and from a culture we're asking for help is very unmanly. Know how to find Churches who helped recent concerts (am a refugee turned American) going through hard times?
zbxxnw,,izas1li,well, i think you are going about things the right way, FIRST  seeking God and going to the church , and keep praying because God answers prayers.  So many people dont do this , but just show up at churches looking for immediate resolutions for their situations and unfortunately a lot of churches are in financial situations themselves , membership is down, etc. Keep attending, and you will meet people, talk to the minister and explain your situation , he might be able to direct you , I've even known some Ministers that allowed people to stay in the church for awhile . What country are you from originally may I ask?
zbxxnw,,j1zzn8q,Religion is the refuge of the weak minded and cowardly. Pray to yourself the only true saviour.
zbxxnw,,izpmcou,How does that look rough? Looks like brand spanking new sheets, pillow, walls look clean etc looks like a normal room to me lmao. Maybe I‚Äôm just seeing shit tho
zbsbbq,iytarsm,,Is there an encampment there?
zbsbbq,,iytegam,Not to my knowledge. They‚Äôve been getting the homeless off the streets
zbobtv,iyt5d8w,,This was a very interesting read, I enjoyed the peek inside your head. I‚Äôm always interested in hearing people‚Äôs stories, their personal philosophies, the experiences that shaped those ideas.
zbobtv,,iywrjbn,I see my individuality, as an instrument in a band... collectively, they work together to form complex aural landscapes people get lost in for a few minutes.  Individually, each instrument needs to be unique and aware of how it is different from the other instruments, to better compliment them.  There's a time for everyone to play the same thing, and a time when everyone needs to play their different parts.  Lots of mixing in-between.  Individualism isn't about a spotlight.  It is about being the best individual one can be for oneself.  This doesn't mean one has to be selfish.  If being the best individual you can be for YOU, means that you have to give out cigarettes every day... or make meals for others... or greet everyone with a smile and a "Howya doin t'day?"... then that's you.   Every bass player doesn't have to sound and play the same way, to be the best individual bass players they can be.  It is about recognizing and acknowledging your own distinction first, and then integrating it into everything else.  Not that you asked.  There is a book's worth (I wrote it in 2013) on a whole slice of how and why I am who and where I am today.  I left out that slice almost completely in this summarization.  I didn't leave it out as a promotion.. I wrote the book as a therapy in figuring out what the fuck I had been putting myself through for 40 years.  Suffice it to day, I have issues with authority I cannot trust... and I tend to be as smart as, or smarter than, most of the authority I find myself under when getting an unskilled job.  I realize that this might sound arrogant... but I've found that being really smart only makes my own ignorance easier for me to deal with than most folks have in handling what they don't know.  For me, there is no stupid... there is only "I don't know yet."  This doesn't mean there aren't things I cannot do.  I'm better with my limitations, maybe?  Lazier with them, definitely.  The point THERE.. is that instead of adapting to the new conditions of my last job, I let myself get fired.  When Staples as a company decided that they no longer wanted to perform hardware repairs on computers... only software repairs... and they wanted to handle all the software repairs offsite by remote... they eliminated the computer repair positions in all 2000+ of their stores.  In December of 2016.  The Easy Tech position was replaced by a sales job.  The job went from actually taking apart computers to find out what was wrong... to either plugging a computer into a network and walking away, or selling the customer a new computer.  It involved cuts in pay for many.  Staples had helped gut the computer repair industry (with Best Buy, and Office Depot/Max, etc) when it began offering the repair service, putting many small repair shops out of business (they had the name recognition, and 2000+ locations at the time) and then hiring their previous technicians.  Staples eliminated their parts vendor.  You literally couldn't order parts to perform repairs anymore.  The day after the store manager announced the new policy, a woman walked in with a older Dell Latitude in one hand, and hard drive in the other.  My manager was standing behind me.  I felt like the scene was staged.  This laptop... has a drawer on the side.  Two screws, and you slide the hard drive out.  5 minutes to do it and SHOW her how she can do it.  I had to say.. "I'm sorry, we don't do these repairs anymore.  Can I show you a new laptop?"  When I had gotten the job, two previous managers ago, I was asked where I saw myself in 5 years.  I said I wanted to be running a recycled computer business, possibly a branch of Re-PC out of Seattle/Tukwila (I was in Aberdeen at the time).  And here I was, three years later, being told that to keep my job, I have to tell people to throw away perfectly good machines, in favor of selling them a new one to avoid installing a new hard drive.  Or whatever.  I LIKE repairing computers.  I had to go.  I couldn't fight the company... crazy to think so.  All kinds of other shitty things they do in the name of making money.  If you purchase something off the Staples website that they don't sell in the store... and you return it to a store because you don't like it (but there is otherwise nothing wrong with it)... the store will then destroy this perfectly good whatever, and write it off.  Chain policy.  This process is cheaper for them, than packaging and shipping it back to the drop-shipper where it originated from, since Staples didn't actually provide this product from any warehouse or store it owns.  I can't count the number of tablets... CODY is one brand name I remember, that were smashed at the store I worked at.  My need for a job became second to my need to distance myself from that company.  I told my boss what I thought, included a bit of telling off as well... and got the final two writeups he needed to fire me.  I signed a one year non-competition contract when I got the job... It isn't enforceable, but if I ever used Staples as a reference for that year, they'd bring it up, so enforceable or not it existed.  I had a friend, a manager of a different Staples... the guy who was behind hiring me (while he knew I was homeless, I might add) in the first place.... make the call and find out six months later.  He was curious as to how long this other manager would hold a grudge.  I guess there's been plenty of stupid after the "I don't know... yet" phase.  Choices again.  Informed stupid though.  Maybe not plenty... definitely enough informed stupid.  One man's stupid is another man's genius though.  Truck nuts.  Someone made bank off that.
zbobtv,iyu8m85,,Thank you for this trip inside your mind Bongart .
zbobtv,,iywznxo,You are welcome.  I... hope \*nudge, nudge\*... it makes me, make more sense.  It doesn't explain everything, but then again, we all have stories, and it would take a lifetime to really, ***really*** hear just one.
zbobtv,iyteigt,,Thank you for sharing.  Hopefully I‚Äôll get that happiness bit figured out.  Stay safe.
zbobtv,,iywj4h0,It's a process?  I'm going sideways for a second.. I'll veer back towards the point in a second (edit.. Slab Second).  One of the things I do... for fun and practice.. is to transcribe existing music.  I'll listen to a recording, and break it down, track by track, score it out in Piano Roll Notation, and reproduce it digitally.  Same thing we did in cover bands... listen, break down our parts, and put it back together with us at the helm.  I do it for fun and practice solo, because it keeps me "in shape", when it comes to using the Digital Audio Workstation software.  Just like practicing with an instrument.  Considering how you can build a piece of music with it, from the ground up, without using any actual recordings, makes the DAW an actual musical instrument of its own.  A really smart synth, you might say.  An unlimited number of tracks, full effects bank, stocked MIDI rack... all in one software package.  I digressed in my digression.  Anyway... ever sit in a room full of people, listening to the different conversations, focusing on one and blocking out all the rest... and then refocusing on a different conversation and blocking out the previous one?  Recognizing happiness is sometimes like that.  Like... listening to a complex arrangement, and picking out just one part to focus on.  Dogs do it when they stick their heads out car windows... or really all the time.  They can focus on one smell out of everything their 20,000x greater or more sense of smell picks up.  It's there.  Happiness is always there somewhere.  It just gets masked or buried by everything else around it.
zbobtv,,iyxfcbt,Ahhh, hmph‚Ä¶okay, yeah I‚Äôm getting it.  Admittedly, I was a bit worried with trying to understand from a musical/tech perspective (I‚Äôm deficient in the areas, but appreciate the arts), yet you wrapped it up nicely bongart. Ty.  Somethings I‚Äôll have to sit on and reference‚Ä¶like slab second. Lol. Enjoyed that one.  Yes, in my case, there‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs happened lately and my happiness most certainly got covered up along the way and past trauma arose to the top.  Thankfully I was at least able to obtain a safety release for my nephews (with help from their mother‚Äôs sisters working with me and social services) and get them back to their home State and into school again.  Unfortunately‚Ä¶had to leave their mother out there to her own decisions for now.   Again, enjoyed your posting and replies‚Ä¶might take me more time to catch on fully, but hey, I‚Äôve got some unique things to reference and therefore, look forward to.  Perhaps one day, I‚Äôll figure out how to halfway use this site properly eh?.
zbobtv,,iz0hrbp,I'm still figuring all this stuff out too.  Like... when you spot a bit of shiny happiness, and you make a move, and some big ugly angry slides in-between like a hurricane going for Florida.  Do you handle the angry, or do you deal with the spikes, push it aside, and continue for the happy?    How does one deal with that spiky anger thing properly to not lose sight of the happy, when one is also dealing with a dogged and relentless memory that won't let one forget one saw that Bit O'Happy?  That's when I look over at Zen for hints.
zbobtv,iyt35p3,,Thanks for motivating and interesting work
zbobtv,,iywypoq,I would like to help motivate others to try and... dispassionately... diagnostically... examine their own choices.  Fuck good or bad at first.  Just identifying and acknowledging them is hard enough.  "I had no choice" is actually extraordinarily rare in the wild.  It more often means "I had no choice I liked, would, or could accept".  A guy cut his own arm off, wrote a book and got it turned into a movie, rather than accept the idea of "I had no choice" when faced with the situation of dying trapped in the desert.  Yes, an extreme example... but still... it points out that there is almost ALWAYS another choice... or choices.  Not good ones... but they are choices nonetheless.    Many people have difficulty recognizing the choices that LED them into situations where they felt they were choice-less.  Can an individual rise out of poverty into "wealth"?  Sure.  Not all the methods are scrupulous.  Some of the good/valid methods require specific personality types to pull off (great at sales/meeting new people, head for business and numbers, etc).  Sometimes a method (door to door sales, repair, etc) only works for the first few who bring something new to the table, and all those who try to follow afterwards find only a market already flooded with product/services.  Not everyone can be a well-paid rap star.  Or whatever the newest music trend will be.  Or whatever the newest get-rich-quick scheme will be.  Or great product everyone needs.  The first few blaze a trail and drink their fill, the mass that follows lives on trickles.  Knowing why one makes the choices one makes.. the honest why, not the "I feel justified in believing this particular why" goes a long way in making better choices.  Not necessarily better for a position in society... but better for the one.  Not selfish, because being selfish isn't by default better for the one.  A healthy individual knows when to say no, because life cannot always be "yes".  Sure... yes most of the time, and no occasionally.  Individual balance.  That's what I want people to look at more.  Their individual choices.  Yes, things happen TO people that is out of their control.  If some can turn individual tragedy into what **they feel** is success... doesn't that prove that the process itself is possible for anyone?  It is a matter of what we choose to do, with what we have and who we are, in any given situation.  If we have to change who we are... that is still a choice.  I'm not advocating the change... I've rejected change often enough... too often, most likely... it is the choice to accept or reject it that is important.  And the why.  I fiercely reject changing from who I perceive myself to be, because I have become a person I can live with, with morals and ethics that make me feel good about BEING me.  I like my own companionship, and I can entertain myself better than most others can entertain me.  I have found that being happy, for me, doesn't have to include another person directly.  Sure.  I can be happy playing a video game someone else made... but I'm not in a room with them, relying on who they are and what they say and do to be entertained.  I'm playing the game they made, or watching the movie they produced, or listening to the song they played bass on, etc.  That's me, because I'm honest with myself about what it takes **for me** to be happy.  It is still my choice to reject change... to not become what someone else would have me be.  Maybe if I was presented with a better deal... change, and you get THIS!...maybe.  I just haven't been presented with it, or found it, yet.  I haven't faced that choice yet.
zbobtv,izb6wuq,,Thanks for writing this up. It's good to hear a bit more from you. There is a zen poem that comes to mind, which this reminds me of. Especially about finding happiness, even if it comes hand in hand with unhappiness or circumstances that others might find miserable or untenable...  "Joyous in this mountain retreat, yet still feeling melancholy.  Reading the lotus sutra,  practicing zazen singlemindedly.  What do love and hate matter,  when I'm here all alone  listening to the sound of the rain  late in this autumn evening." ~ Dogen Zenji (1200-1253)
zbobtv,,izd2iad,I like to work on always seeing things from as many different points of view as I can.  I have a mental exercise where I try to put things in terms of being seen through a camera... not to be making mental movies or pictures... but to assist in the ability of finding a different point of view.  With an actual camera, this is rather easy.  One just changes location, or even just makes setting changes with the lens... wide field of view, versus a tight focus that blurs everything else.....  Aperture Science... we do what we must, because we can.  Sorry... couldn't just leave that tangent alone.  ... Sometimes, it is so I can confirm, sometimes it is just to learn, sometimes it is so I can see better where I'm wrong (and confirm that), etc.  Sometimes for fun.  The self is still there though.  I'm working on it.  Multiple POVs make it easier to  blur my own attachment to what I'm seeing/experiencing/talking about.  I'm at the stage where I still see Zen as a goal, when I know it really isn't.  And that was pretty cool.  Thank you.
zbobtv,,izd62v0,You're welcome! And it's okay! Never leave the Portal jokes out xD
zbobtv,izclux6,,I hope you pursue section 8 to gain climate control among other things!
zbobtv,j2eyj1m,,Your biography would be a book a lot of people would love to read, for familiarity and for insight.
zbobtv,,j2y21gr,I'd have to title it something like "*Pitfalls you didn't know you should worry about*".  I'm a guy in a man-made cave who doesn't like what the world around him has become.  I've said it before... Science Fiction is partly to blame, for teaching me how to see what man could become, and being disappointed in man for not becoming it.  I appreciate the thought though.
zbobtv,j888jdh,,i have constantly dreamed about living in slab city, its complete freedom with survival just on what you build. i would literally give up everything just to even visit there, its almost a fantasy land from how surreal it sounds.
zbobtv,,j8978c1,>its complete freedom  No,  it isn't.  It isn't The Last Free place either.  Yes, you do have more freedoms than other places.  Most of us here are broke and homeless... broke, as in no money, and broken, as in mentally ill to some degree.  Unless you aren't in the USA, getting here is as easy as sticking out your thumb.  You wouldn't have to give up anything, let alone everything.  Fantasy land... yes, that is an apt description for the majority here who live in their own fantasy land, rather than spending time in the real world.  We frequently refer to Babylon.... and Babylon is everywhere that is not Slab City.  The only thing stopping you from coming here, is yourself, and likely some subconscious common sense.  Survival takes many forms.  Some here survive by preying on others.
zblcwz,iytj49r,,You've said previously that you were considering a mental hospital. If you do have mental health problems, you should get those under control before going to school. Depending on what degree you're going for, your life may not be quieter.

zblcwz,,iyw47xg,Missouri is not a good place to plan to rely on social services to help you get to a better place. Columbia is probably slightly better than the rest of the state but it's still not going to be good. if you are a student you could take out loans for housing expenses maybe?

zbkzw4,iyskfar,,I've been in college towns before. Very different from college cities though. When the college is the major reason for the town, it's pretty awesome. When it's like Houston or Chicago, not so much. Every May there's just a bunch of free stuff on the curbs because students move out. Dumpster diving is a gold mine. Frats do volunteering and there's also student ministries so the soup kitchens and coat drives are always doing well. It's cleaner, richer, and these kids will just give you food or money. BUT please be aware, if you scare them, the cops will be on your ass right away. Never be pushy, never stand directly in front of a business to fly a sign. You will be able to tell by their body language right away if you scare them. Don't push your luck and you can live a very comfortable life.
zbkzw4,,iyto6m7,Well explained. Thank you.  My own college town experience was somewhat similar, with the exception that at times some homeless were undoubtedly harassed/abused.   I‚Äôd like to say mostly this wasn‚Äôt the case though. Most people were kind and understanding.   Football game days were here and there, typically before the game was alright‚Ä¶it was after the game you had to be careful. No matter who you are.   Got some of my own furniture freebies at the end of semesters.   Ten years ago there used to be quite a few abandoned houses that many squatted in‚Ä¶I personally don‚Äôt recall any issues. However, after moving away and over the years of revisiting the area‚Ä¶things have changed drastically and those houses were (I‚Äôll say lightly, claimed) and renovated.  No abandoned houses exist in the area that I‚Äôm aware of anymore due to the market.  There used to be several empty lots that now have houses built on them now, one we used to gather around on, with a small camp fire and just have good times.  It‚Äôs changed a lot for sure. So much that I personally have lost interest in going by when I‚Äôm in the area.
zbkzw4,iys1h7n,,There are probably more resources like food or clothes/hygiene donations in a small area, but some of them might be restricted to students
zbkzw4,iytnpjl,,Go Ducks.
zbkzw4,iyubx63,,I can tell you that they make it very hard to be homeless at my school (University of Alabama)
zbkzw4,,iyv47bo,Anything in particular about the college town or just run of the mill homeless issues?
zbkzw4,,iyw2kmf,Cops are everywhere and will hassle anyone that doesn‚Äôt pass for a student or faculty member. It‚Äôs the south and the administration is very conservative, there‚Äôs large distances between any place you could potentially sleep and the places you could panhandle, if you even could. Although the college area is very rich, the college is supported by a labor pool of poor black folks that live outside of town in old crumbling flats. The police purposefully patrol the old color lines in between these areas so that getting back and forth is difficult.
zb38bb,iyras2v,,I wish the homeless would band together and demand homeless legislation like no spikes , the handles ins the Bench.. more public outlets, decriminalize pissing by a bush.. hot food on EBT.. also free bus rides strait up
zb38bb,,iyrg9f1,You would demand all of that and not affordable housing?
zb38bb,,iyrhvej,Of course that the ultimate goal but in politics here you gotta negotiate something. All of those things would eliminate a lot of problems for us in general.   My worry is they make living outside almost nice than inside then more people who end up homeless will stay longer. It seems like a problem but it‚Äôs better to hand out clean needles and dispose of the used than just let addicts get infections
zb27n4,iyosamy,,Because I‚Äôm sick of all the guns I‚Äôve had drawn on me, sick of all the psychotic bums balls deep in addiction, sick of the police bothering me pushing me to keep moving all night long, as long as you keep moving it ain‚Äôt loitering right?

zb27n4,,iyqgdy0,I did wilderness camping in an ice storm. Nearly died but was laughing my head off. All of the down trees and firewood was covered in a glaze of ice.  I had to thaw the wood to get a fire going, while running out of firemaking material.
zb27n4,,iyp0zvc,What equipment would you recommend?  Large backpack Small tent Lighter Pocket knife  Outside of these basics any advice or tips?
zb27n4,,iyphpuw,I‚Äôm making it with just some cheap parachord and an axe I got from Walmart. Everything else is just common sense really, sleeping bag, tent or tarp. People overcomplicate this shit for social media views but honesty you can go far with just an axe and some rope.
zb27n4,,iyp811t,I had a mummy sleeping bag rated for cold weather. I wouldn't have made it past night one without one.
zb27n4,,iytertv,Did you have a sleeping pad under the mummy sleeping bag?
zb27n4,,iytiyst,It was like a yoga mat, one of those foam ones. They have some that you can inflate too. These days, in the city, it's like five layers of cardboard. No matter where you are, you want to create a space between you and the ground, the ground will pull the heat from your body.
zb27n4,,iyqgikr,My A.L.I.C.E. Pack could fit the whole entire world inside of it. They used to be cheap army surplus but those doomsday prepper types have driven the price way up.
zb27n4,,iypzgta,get a two-person tent with a footprint of something like 6 or 7 ft by 4 ft and an oversized 120x120 or California king size blanket that you can put over the tent and then a small tarp to put over that and you won't need any heaters and you'll probably not even need a sleeping bag for warmth at least. it's game changing.  just make sure that the blanket you use or the two that you overlap covers the entire tent down to the ground.  and if you want to do two layers it'll help even more really depends on how cold it is outside

zb27n4,iyow64l,,I'm back in the city now after spending a little bit of time in the woods. It was wonderful. Scary at first, but then absolutely peaceful. I'd make a long walk once every few days for supplies and that's when things went wrong. I got a blister in my heel, it popped, got infected, got real sick, first a mild fever, then red lines going up my leg and everything feeling hot. I was real weak. Longest walk of my life getting to a place where people could find me and call an ambulance. A few days in the hospital until I was stable, then booted to the street again.   I got real lucky. I can't imagine making that walk if I had broken my leg, or bit by a rattlesnake. I love the woods, but unless I have a way of getting out when I get in trouble. If you're wanting this, please know how to take care of yourself. People can be dangerous,  but sometimes not having anyone around can be just as dangerous.   Stay safe everyone, stay warm, you are all loved.
zb27n4,,iyp5xps,I stayed in the woods the few months I was homeless. But I was an avid backpacker before that and had the proper supplies to set up a livable camp, the right clothes and shoes, a good first aid kit, and wilderness medicine training. I can‚Äôt imagine trying to do that with few or no supplies.
zb27n4,,iyphgh6,Nature in essence is predictable, especially with experience. Truly it‚Äôs not for everyone. I‚Äôm glad you made it out alive tho. GG
zb27n4,,iypi7ui,That was my biggest shortcoming.  I was inexperienced, I waited too long thinking the infection would get better.   I've been in some sketchy situations in the city too, especially as a smaller woman. Never had a gun pulled on me though, let alone multiple times! If I had your know how, I'd ditch this place in a heartbeat. Happy trails friend, that fire looks so damn nice!
zb27n4,,iyqld79,This! Have some sort of first aid kit. I lived in a campground for a year once and I got food poisoning and I ended up in the ER. I had never been so sick in my life but if it hadn't been for my son checking on me, I would've died
zb27n4,,iyponng,Vaseline is great to keep in your pack for blisters.

zb27n4,iyp1yki,,City life isn‚Äôt for everyone. My dream was always a nice house out in the country with some land.. staying in the woods is as close as I can get right now haha
zb27n4,iyp5b5d,,I grew up in the woods, I‚Äôm originally from a small town in VT. I wasn‚Äôt homeless until much later in life in San Jose, CA, which is a city but a strange city where parts of it (or not far from it) are quite rural. Just about every spot I ever lived was quite far off the beaten path and my other friends tended to feel uncomfortable out there. I loved it and I rarely had to deal with the constant sweeps like my friends. Most of the places I lived I was able to stay for a year or longer.
zb27n4,,iypgo7i,I saw this thing on TikTok where a lady from the Appalachia area was saying never stay in the woods at night and don‚Äôt look in the trees. Something about how if you name the thing she‚Äôs talking about you‚Äôll summon it? Have you ever heard of anything like this?
zb27n4,,iypi1pp,That sounds like some scary story superstition bs. I‚Äôve heard many different versions of this kind of thing around campfires. They‚Äôre not true, just scary stories.

zb27n4,iyq89ln,,Having a good two-way radio is a smart move
zb27n4,iyr04w8,,Totally agree. Woods are the way. When I was young and didn't have a home, a guy let me stay in an abandoned school bus on his property in the middle of the woods. No idea how the bus got there, but the seats had been taken out. I got it all clean and tidy inside. There was a compartment in the floor where I kept my powdered milk mix in a glass jug, wrapped in wet cloth- it stayed surprisingly cold that way. Dug an outhouse, had a nice firepit outside and a cast iron skillet, a big coffee pot, and there were a lot of wild berries which were such a treat in summer. I would never have survived in the city. People ruin everything.
zb27n4,iyrzd85,,I live in the woods but not that far out. I come in every night to sit at a 24 hour Wal-Mart because it‚Äôs safer. Than I go back to the woods during the day and sleep.
zb27n4,iyotwft,,is that s scanner? That's smart tbh
zb27n4,,iyoyglm,Yeah UV5R  works decent in a yard.

zb27n4,,iyox4c2,Just in case someone comes by because they're loitering in the woods. No, really.
zb27n4,,iyp18sr,I don't understand, like it will detect cop walkie talkies or to call for help?
zb27n4,,iyphven,I just use it to listen to what trains are doing in a yard. For police or calling for help is pretty much useless, most PD‚Äôs use P25 SDR radios and hams are just annoying.
zb27n4,,iypo43j,It's nice when you can listen to police on it. A friend (NYC, still analog there) was walking in a parking garage with one and there was some suspicious activity going on in the distance and he turned it on on the police channel and it echoed throughout the parking garage and the suspicious people took off running.
zb27n4,,iyq8q1i,As a licensed amateur radio operator, I agree. They are annoying.
zb27n4,,iyp1k7h,I think it'll pick up any radio transmissions made in it's range, so they'll know if someone's around and what they're doing.
zb27n4,,iyp1q4o,Oh ok thankyou!
zb27n4,iyr0khs,,What resources can you recommend for studying homelessness-outdoor survival? I want to know  \- what kind of geography / location / landscape you want to look for for safe, long term living, free from wild animals as well as potential harassment from people  \- Should I also buy crop seeds and a water filtration system, or rain water collection system
zb27n4,,iyrnoma,This is nearly impossible.   There are wildernesses left in some parts of the country that you could probably walk miles into and never see another person, and basically be free to build what you can.   But it's going to be very, very far from the closest Walmart, grocery store, traditional resources, and you'll require bare minimum .270 rifle and tons of ammo, lots of cold weather gear, all traditional survival gear, and even as an enthusiast I really don't know how you can dry more than a few pounds of meat before a kill goes bad in summer, maybe if you had tons of huge drying racks and tinder and wood set up, and drying meat is an acquired skill, as hunters we take a cooler and ice the meat. And any place with sufficient big game will also have predator animals, I think the ideal area would have big game like elk, moose, or caribou and black but not brown bears, you don't wanna play with brown bears, black ones aint really shit and just another food source.  Also I've studied wild plants extensively, but even if you get to know wild plants, you'll really only know everything about one given area and if you go 100 km you'll only recognize a few things, and it is dangerous business the phone and identifying apps are a game changer. From some old illustration in a book you'd probably confuse Queen Anne's lace for hemlock, whoops lol  Most homeless people are staying in wooded/undeveloped areas bordering cities, undeveloped land often exists in midsized cities along the river in floodzones. In these areas, I have seen people build shanties or shacks and the like, and I've heard of dudes set up for ten or twenty years, but as times change these places become more scarce and more likely for police to run through, which is one reason why people who accept or embrace homelessness rather than go to shelter and try to get two jobs are typically always moving around and only possess and invest into what they can carry.   What you're looking for is homesteading, which is a dead practice that no longer exists anywhere in the world, and we are all forced to either obey our masters as landless peasants or face heavy persecution, the entire planet is colonized by central banks cheers
zb27n4,,iyrdih1,I don‚Äôt stick around one place for too long to have a suitable long term survival shelter. Flat land with decent cover for a fire, being cautious of animal tracks and shit in the area. If you can manage a small garden by all means go for it and I‚Äôd recommend a water filtration unit for now but having a rain collector would also come in handy if you choose to go the Long term route, also city planning comes into play. Last thing you want is to put days work into a shelter only for the city to come in and ‚Äúexpand‚Äù
zb27n4,iyr4sdh,,Would it be better/safer for women on their own as well?  Genuine question tyia
zb27n4,,iyrct1d,It‚Äôs possible, but honestly all the women I know that are homeless or are traveling homeless have a dog, or stay in groups. It‚Äôs tough be careful out there.

zb07ru,iyopcvw,,Yea white vinegar or get at it with one of those bleach wipes. All in all you gotta dry out your gear before you stuff it into a sack to evade all that gross mold build up same shit happened to my sleeping bag.
zb07ru,iyown79,,Especially with covid, those little bottles of hand sanitizer were everywhere. You could get it for free or super cheap. I keep a little squeeze bottle with me and take a couple free squirts when i see a bottle. Awesome for cleaning and killing smells. FYI,  don't use rubbing alcohol. Something about it can deteriorate and weaken plastic.
zb07ru,,iyqyqa2,You hand sanitizer your tent ??
zb07ru,,iyri7fx,There's a spot in my tent where moisture tends to run down and pool. After a couple days it will smell like mildew. I put some hand sanitizer on a napkin and wipe the area. Knocks out the mildew immediately

zb07ru,iyowyba,,Be careful not to breathe the fumes of whatever you're using in that enclosed space.   I haven't tried white vinegar myself but at least it sounds less toxic/unpleasant than rubbing alcohol or chlorine bleach.
zb07ru,iyrwikq,,If I have money and it's on sale I'll grab a bottle of spray lysol. It really helps to keep mildew from happening and when I can't clean it properly it makes me feel a little better thinking the mildew that's there is a little cleaner (even if it probably isn't.) I found myself becoming over-paranoid about germs during covid. Trying to rein that in.
zaxtff,iyoj2pq,,Food is definitely very easy to get lots of daily in most places. Your help is very appreciated. Personally, I love banana bread. Maybe visit a couple places and see what's already being passed out, and go from there.   It seems I crave a lot of sugar out here. I think it's because everything takes a ton of energy when your homeless.
zaxtff,,iz31hqv,Okay noted, Ill pick up some bakery items! Thank you for the advice ‚ù§Ô∏è
zaxtff,iyocw6b,,Just ask people what they want. Might be something other than food. Best way to know what is needed is to ask directly.

zaxtff,iyox187,,Nice clean socks!!!!
zaxtff,iyogbxm,,Non perishable food. Soup with easy open tops. Sardines, crackers. Beef Jerky. Candy bars.
zaxtff,iyrh92j,,Notice how the list of potential suggestions is varied?  That's because homeless are individuals, with individual needs.  So... as has been suggested, if you want to know what some of the homeless people who are near you would like, you should ask **THEM**.  Here's another way of looking at this.  If someone on the internet said that they would love a Whopper from Burger King, would you automatically assume ALL the homeless people near you would also like Whoppers?  You honestly would have no idea if the suggestion even came from an \*actual\* homeless person.  So... if a stranger on the internet says you should give out socks, why assume all the homeless people near you would ALSO like socks?  It might resonate with YOU... as in, if YOU were homeless, YOU might like socks.  That doesn't mean it will resonate with any of the homeless individuals near you.  I don't need socks.  I need to get to the laundromat, so I can wash all the dirty socks I have... since instead of doing laundry, I just got more socks.  Think about that.  Does this mean you should give out rolls of quarters instead?  NO.  It means that individuals have individual needs... and the **only** common need that the involuntarily homeless share, is a need for a home.  Check your local area.  If there is a food bank near you... donate whatever food items you want to give out, to the food bank.  Why **re-invent** the distribution system, when there is already one in place?  The only difference between the homeless in your area going to that food bank to get food, and you bringing it to them.... is the fact that they aren't going to get it themselves.  And if there \*IS\* a local food bank, and the local homeless **refuse** to go there to get free food... you should not be indulging the demand that the food be brought to them.  So again.... check your local area.  Is there already a food bank distributing food to the homeless and those in need?  In fact, if there \*IS\* a local food bank... go to it.  See how far away it is, and see what they give out for food.  Ask THEM what they could use as far as donated items they can pass out.  If you go there, and you see that what they pass out is completely inadequate... then of course, try to add something.  You might even find that what they need are volunteers more than food.But if you go to that food bank, and you find they give out far more than you could imagine... that might inspire the question "Why aren't the homeless people that you want to help using this food bank?".  It might simply be because it is in the next county, miles away.  There's a difference between people **choosing** not to make use use of available services, and **there not being** any available services.  We live in a world where you have to do SOME kind of work to get the food you eat....  locating and picking your own berries or nuts, growing your own vegetables, hunting small or large game, dressing/prepping/chopping/cooking the food, going to the store to purchase the food, having or earning the money to have food brought to you, etc.  SOMEWHERE along the line, there has to be some kind of work involved, in exchange for eliminating the distance between whatever the food is, and an individual's stomach.  If that work amounts to trudging to the food bank (or soup kitchen, or church, or shelter, etc)... then so be it.  When an individual says that they **don't want** to go get it for themselves... why should that desire to be serviced be indulged?  If there's no food bank, then sure... go give out food.  If there are no soup kitchens.. again... go give out whatever want.  I used to try to tell people far more about the benefits of volunteering, or even trying to organize food banks and soup kitchens when there aren't any... but fuck it.  No one wants to actually help eliminate the issue.  They just want to help for a day and feel good about helping.  Just be smart about it.  If there are no services near you... go ahead and help.  If there ARE services for the homeless near you... try to help those SERVICES.  You'll help far more people that way.  You will be helping the people who are TRYING to help themselves.... by helping those who CHOOSE to use the services around them.
zaxtff,,iz326a1,Yes, I understand that. I was homeless before and only made this post because they won‚Äôt tell me what they individually want out of what i‚Äôm assuming is fear of sounding greedy.  The area i‚Äôm in is very unkind to homeless people and resources are far and few between. There are practically no shelters, food banks, or soup kitchen. It‚Äôs almost like a small skid row.
zaxtff,,iz3kt9z,Then shouldn't there BE soup kitchens and food banks and church canned food drives?  Why is a sandwich, a pair of socks, and a "Sorry life sucks" better than starting to organize and provide the missing services?
zaxtff,,iz5agt9,I‚Äôm 17. I‚Äôm doing what I can. Why can‚Äôt providing food and warm clothes be enough? üôÑ
zaxtff,,iz65djx,What happens tomorrow?  And the next day?  You give out gift bags/care packages, and you feel better because you "helped" the homeless.  You'd carry that feeling for a while... yeah?  The homeless you helped will still be homeless while you feel better about being you.  If they were hungry before, they will be hungry again long before your good feeling wears off.  What does being 17 have to do with anything?  You can't talk to people, because you are 17?  You can't do Google searches to see where the local churches are, and go and talk to the people who run them to see what they could contribute to creating a soup kitchen?  Some small towns have soup kitchens that are only open once or twice a week.  You can't walk around the town where you live, and talk with the managers and owners of the stores, and see what they could contribute?  Because you are 17?  You can't go to a town council meeting and watch and learn what goes into the proposals that the town approves of?  You can't learn how to draft a proposal... because of your age?  You can't do a natural language search in Google, like... [how to write a proposal to open a new soup kitchen](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+write+a+proposal+to+open+a+new+soup+kitchen)... and sift through the results?  The process itself of ACTUALLY opening one isn't easy... far easier to open a clothing bank... and I'm not saying that YOU have to do this solo and all alone.  You could start the ball rolling, and get a local church to open a soup kitchen, with help and donations from around town that you organized.  The church would handle the non-profit stuff, and likely would supply the actual kitchen and eating space.  Maybe you were the one who got the different stores around town to donate the food.  Maybe you'd be the one to shlep all the way out to the nearest food bank, to talk to the local director about how to get a shipment that would be used for the soup kitchen you were now affiliated with.  This is all networking.  This is... paying attention, talking to people, schmoozing, organizing... maybe a few spreadsheets... making pins on your copy of Google maps... and a TON of going from place to place.. to place to place... etc.  This is getting involved in your local government, to see how they do things and learn part of the process.  A proposal... is just an idea... broken down into a specific format and presented in a specific fashion.  You stand at a podium with a microphone, you provide a summary of the concept, pointing out where the town would be responsible (using a closed Recreation Center maybe?)... proposed sites for the soup kitchen, etc.  Again... the best place to learn what works best in your town... is at one of your town council meetings.   They are open to the public (except in cases of special, posted closed session town council meetings).  It doesn't have to be tomorrow.  Start with churches.  Take a weekend, figure out where they actually are.  Rough out what you'd say.  You are a former homeless youth, there's no soup kitchen in the area, and you'd like to talk about what it would take to start one.  Maybe the next weekend, go to the nearest church.  After that first conversation, you'll have a much better idea with what to say at the next church.  And GO to the next church, even if the first one says they love the idea and want to do it all themselves.  Go and observe some town council meetings.  get them used to seeing your face without saying anything.  Watch, and learn.  Take notes.  Your youth cannot stop you from making more people... targeted people... aware of the problem and a desire for the solution.  By just starting the conversation, you won't necessarily have to be the one who finishes it.
zaxtff,,izgd4kr,Yeah actually. I‚Äôm 17, meaning I‚Äôm a full time student doing duel enrollment in college and high school and I work a full time job and I foster kittens. I don‚Äôt exactly have the time to ditch school and my job that supports me and the lives that rely on me to go to council meetings or volunteer at the non-existent soup kitchens in my area, nor do I have the time to start one.  I don‚Äôt just give out gift bags to feel better about myself, that‚Äôs an extremely rude and tone deaf thing to say. I do it because it‚Äôs what I can to make someone‚Äôs day a little easier. Its what I wished someone would‚Äôve done for me. It‚Äôs terribly disheartening that I can‚Äôt feed them everyday, but I CAN feed them today. And like I said, my area is NOT KIND to homeless people, you don‚Äôt think people before me have tried to get the ball rolling? It‚Äôs not that easy. Do you not realize what‚Äôs you‚Äôre saying? You listed off a ton of things that take a LOT of time and are a LOT of work. If I had all the time, energy, and bravery in the world, I would network, talk to people, organize, research, etc, but I don‚Äôt and life‚Äôs not that easy. What I do have is 10 minutes to stop at the store to feed someone for a week. It‚Äôs the best I can do, so I do it.  You‚Äôd probably be a lot happier if you weren‚Äôt so negative.
zaxtff,,izh2gos,>Yeah actually. I‚Äôm 17, meaning I‚Äôm a full time student  That's even better.  The High School... means you speak to your guidance counselor, about this being a school project.  Ask if it could become something where other students get involved, and you get course credit for the work.  In regards to college, if you get any money through FAFSA, you are eligible for a Work Study grant.... a chunk of money that gets doled out to you weekly, in exchange for some kind of work program given to you by the college.  Your college financial aid office might be able to connect you with a student advisor, and you could potentially turn this into a college credit project, with a paycheck.  You have boots on the ground, where help is needed.  You have experience being homeless.  You have a desire to help.  You can combine all of that, and again... just get the project off the ground and into the hands of the people who would make it a reality.  That's going to make a difference.  Temporary stop-gap measures aren't enough.  The access to food has to be regular, not sporadic.  You asked why what you want to give isn't enough.  Because that kind of help doesn't last.
zaxtff,iyox450,,First of all, thank you, that's very kind of you and it is super appreciated!!  They have those little squeeze tubes of peanut butter. Light, no utensils needed, packed with calories. They also have apple sauce, and other stuff too. Soft non refrigerate foods are great, especially for those folks with teeth problems.
zaxtff,,iz32gj7,Oh perfect! I picked up a few of those packets last time along with some bread so Im happy those were a good choice, I‚Äôll be sure to get some more. Thank you for the advice!
zaxtff,,iz6o5r5,Awesome! You've got excellent taste! *wink* But seriously,  you're a hero for doing this. Thank you, thank you,  thank you!!!
zaxtff,iyoe7fy,,Those granola bars are good. Snickers candy. What would you eat if you were in their shoes? Any type of hoagie sandwich. Preferably chicken, would be fine for a day. Once you get to know them , they‚Äôll let you know.
zaxtff,iyphb16,,Hot dogs.. cooked. and popcorn chicken, chicken wings n sauce, some weed, trail mix (saves lives,) apples, jerky, gift cards to fast food or a food store.
zaxtff,iyq215h,,Dollar tree almost always has ultra pasteurized milk that will last 6 months unopened
zaxtff,,iz5kku6,Oh awesome! I grabbed some cereal packs from there so that‚Äôs great advice thank you!
zaxtff,iyp0od1,,Single serving things are best. And if it takes heating to use it can be difficult (not impossible) for people to use.   Thankyou op
zaxtff,,iz32ulx,What kind of single serving items? like little snack packs? Thank you for the advice!
zaxtff,,iz3bw4t,I really mean this, thankyou so much for doing this op. It really can help people and honestly the human element of someone caring can mean as much as the items themselves.  Honestly fruit and sandwiches are not ideal for a lot of people.  small bags of chips like the ones you get in a party pack, peanut butter crackers snacks, granola bars or fruit bars are all great. Anything easy on the stomach and tasty is really good. If you can think of anything with vitamins is a good idea like maybe those single bags of cereal that are nutrient fortified.  Something really useful that would be a great thing that most people never think of would be those little rolls of antacids would be really great to offer. Lots of people have stomach issues/ heart burn and those can be a life saver if someone's got bad heartburn.  I hope some of this info helps, I'm no expert but I would think any of these things would have been great to have when I was on the streets a few weeks ago and I know if anything happens this is what I'd want, but I'm just one person so hopefully this is a good base of ideas.   I know most people want to hand out healthy food but honestly I know most people I knew myself included just wanted something tasty and easy to eat. Also caffeine in any capacity is great. I know they're expensive but cliff bars  would be a perfect snack.  Seriously thankyou for being kind enough to try to help people in a way that works for them. You showing interest not just in helping but helping in a way that works for real people means a lot to me. You're good people!
zaxtff,iyoa4fa,,Don‚Äôt worry about distributing food. People have ebt and soup kitchens
zaxtff,,iyoq0y3,Speak for yourself.  I use neither.
zaxtff,,iyrbsuz,I don't think I ever knew that.  Will you say why you use neither?
zaxtff,,iyrcm4e,During the pandemic I learned how to live without them.  I realized I didn't need them.
zaxtff,,iyx1ly9,When I stopped using a PO box, and requested a change to General Delivery, we coincidentally had a fire at the Niland post office.  I couldn't get my notifications from them.  Social services told me they accepted the address change, and kept sending the notifications to the PO box I didn't have access to anymore (I got ***told*** they were being sent, by the box holder.. fucker).  At any rate, I didn't have SNAP anymore... and then a slab minute or two passed.  Fire was in February of this year, so 10 months or so.  I can't remember the last time I went to Commodities (local, once a month food bank) or Ernies (same thing, done here generally the day before or after Commodities).  I understand.
zaxtff,iyse666,, Sandwiches and chips, apples and cuties üòä  Crackers and peanut butter are always a good treat.   Think of things that are shelf stable but not hard to open.   Oatmeal bars, bags of nuts and raisins.  You are very sweet to do what you can ü•∞üëç
zarwc4,iynhldp,,I think it's better to try than to throw them out. You may find some people who really appreciate a healthy, nonperishable, blood sugar friendly snack they can keep on them.
zarwc4,iynmv2l,,Donate them to a food bank or a shelter.
zarwc4,iynbkrf,,Please don't throw them out.
zarwc4,,iynbq5y,So they would make a good snack to pass out you think?? I can‚Äôt get the kids to eat them and I get about 30 more packs a day.
zarwc4,,iyncbfk,For a snack, yes.
zarwc4,iynurmh,,I absolutely love raisins, dried cranberries have lots of added sugar typically, but I've ate pounds of raisins from the food bank, one of the better things I've gotten from the food bank. Nature's fruit roll ups, only dates compete for that.  I'd appreciate it much more than processed junk that is typically given out, I believe most of that simply shouldn't be allowed to be sold for human consumption period. But I'd also think stopping to offer me a pack of raisins was a bit silly, kind of thing someone who wanted to stop to proselytize for their sect would do. I mean 10-20+ packs of raisins though, or idk how big they are but a good amount, that would merit my legitimate appreciation.   And I've been unhoused, so I guess if there's one health food snob who has been unhoused there're probably more.
zarwc4,,iynwa6u,Oh no no I didn‚Äôt plan on stopping to hand out just one. I was going to give them bags that had like 20 packs each on them. There‚Äôs sensuously hundreds so I have plenty to give out.
zarwc4,,iyod9gw,you'd be surprised what a hungry person will eat.... Dumpster diving is disgusting and unhealthy.  Yet folks still encourage and do it. -I'm a certified food handler.  I once saw someone take a half eaten burger out of a teash can and start chowing it down even after I mentioned "Community Dinners" to them.
zarwc4,iyo1cdi,,I would love to get them! You should pass them out. There are always people that are hungry.
zarwc4,iynnowg,,I just wanted to suggest maybe making oatmeal raisin/cranberry cookies or granola bars out of the leftover packs. They're tasty when cooked in oatmeal too!
zarwc4,,iynovbh,I was even thinking of making like. ‚ÄúPower cookies‚Äù with them to give out. Kinda like an oatmeal cookie but with some extra protein !
zarwc4,iyngj4b,,I don't think anyone would be offended but raisins and cranberries aren't very popular with anyone.
zarwc4,,iyngped,I know that‚Äôs why I feel bad because I know it‚Äôs super lame! I would not be hurt if they didn‚Äôt want to take them
zarwc4,,iynujp6,Maybe try a local mutual aid group? Or food not bombs?
zarwc4,iyntccf,,Making cookies is a great idea, also, just offering them to people. Some people will like them. With the excess you can donate to a local food bank
zarwc4,iynwik2,,I like to carry trail mix. Always good even when you don‚Äôt want to eat or it‚Äôs hard to eat because it‚Äôs been a while.
zarwc4,iyo0vn7,,Tell your organization to stop ordering raisins & cranberries!!!!!! Nobody likes them; nobody eats them!!! You might as well be offering pickled eel to people
zarwc4,,iyo1060,I‚Äôm sadly not in charge of that aspect. I‚Äôm the caretaker of the kids. I‚Äôve taken it upon myself to organize these and give out the extras
zarwc4,,iyo16ft,Build a wooden trebuchet and launch them at the offices of those who are in charge of ordering them
zarwc4,iyp697t,,Absolutely do not throw them out, if you want to hand them out feel free to do it. That is an absolutely amazing gesture if enough people did this a difference could definitely be made.
zarwc4,iyp11mu,,Those are super awesome to have.
z9qox7,iyih1pa,,You need a cold weather sleeping bag and figure out how to sleep as flat and level in your car, if you're gonna stay in your car. There's also BLM land, but you have to alternate sites every 14 days at least 25mi apart, so plan for that around your work area.  Research homeless shelters in your area and how much gas you'll use driving to and from work.   Also research laws in your area affecting homeless persons.  In some cities the police will take you into custody if you indicate you're homeless.   Also, go to the post office closest to your job and arrange for all your mail to go there, either to be forwarded and held there or get a POBox.   Get a 5yr CD at a nearby bank or credit union-youll need to deposit at least 500 for it to matter, but if you're a Vet you can get one at Navy Fed CU, open it with $5 and add to it as possible, and also borrow against it. Most others give you 30-60 days to add $500 or more before closing that window and then that's what you're stuck with and you can't borrow against most of those.  This is gonna be your first step to buying a home.  Being homeless is more expensive than renting in many cases. Get yourself a car batter jumper. O'Reillys have some for $84 and they're really good. I keep mine charging on my car while it's running, and then jump my battery every time I need to start it because I need to buy a new battery.   Jack in the Box sells two tacos for a $1. McDonald's sells large coffee for a $1.   Regardless of your beliefs, you gotta change your subconscious attitude toward your situation and your future, and your situation will improve. When you get the chance, go see a movie that's funny, positive and uplifting.   Your age is not a limiting factor. Also, for extra money, look into becoming a Notary Public in your county, then complete the steps to become a Loan Signing Agent. They earn at least $100 per signing, you can do this online, and you're only limited by your time spent doing this. Look on Indeed to find the Keller Williams and Kaiser School of Technology Real Estate License course for free, and apply. This is your second step to buying a home.
z9qox7,,iyleh8t,See how much refills are on coffee at McDonald's. At the one I would frequent, they were free, but it could be different
z9qox7,,iyj26vs,Dude such a pog reply prob best ive ever seen
z9qox7,,iyj60g2,Idk what pog means
z9qox7,,iyj79r5,It means like good or awesome
z9qox7,,iylhzdt,Thanks!
z9qox7,,iyjeq0q,'play of (the) game!'  like the best/most exciting/well executed moment that happened in a particular match.
z9qox7,,iykk19g,Just a note on the last point. Yes, age is a limiting factor in looking for jobs. And in Texas, at least, it is not free to become a notary. The state regulates how much notaries can charge, and the top fees are nowhere near $100. It could be different in other states, but here you can only charge $6 for a signing.
z9qox7,,iyliffl,There's no money in just being a notary public, but you need to be a notary public to become a Loan Signing Agent. They sign and notarize Loan documents for leasing vehicles, or obtaining mortgages on purchasing homes. Loan Signing Agents typically earn $350 per Signing, with the low end at $150 and the high end being paid commission off the sale of truly high end sales.  In Arizona, a Notary earns $2 a notarization. It was $12 for a year, then they dropped it back down. Btw, Texas needs LSAs.
z9qox7,,iyliqsb,Also, the real estate course is tough. For me at least. It's a lot of information, and most of it only makes sense once you'd start thinking about real estate purchasing and laws constantly. But there's no time limit. Once you start, youre in.
z9qox7,iyj1psc,,You‚Äôre not gonna slip at all. You have steady income and a car. You can sleep anywhere, but your car is always an option. You can keep extra shit. I have to carry everything on me at all times but I still have a job and the only way to slip further would be if U got fired and for some reason takes a while to find another one and you have to ration. You‚Äôre going to be okay my friend.
z9qox7,iyjiu7z,,Welcome to the club. Don't be afraid to ask questions. I've been homeless for a decade and worked fulltime for 5 years.
z9qox7,iyivff7,,I'm sorry to hear this. You have a welcoming support group here (r/homeless). What are your current circumstances?
z9qox7,iykt6ql,,r/urbancarliving  Find a good supportive case manager and (if in the US) complete the VI-SPDAT as soon as possible . Get your name onto as many housing wait-lists as possible. Some of these wait-list have years long waits.
z9qox7,iyk01hd,,how do you ration your car for heat?  This is a serious question.
z9qox7,iykejfj,,Well, how did you get to this position? Can you rent a room? Poke around on craigslist and any local Facebook groups to see if anybody has a room for rent.  Any coworkers that can help ? Circle K has a special i think its $10 a month for 1 XL polar pop drink a day.....hang in there
z9qox7,iyli24v,,Gym memberships.
z9qox7,iymkaxs,,At least you have a car
z989kx,iyfyjto,,i was homeless in oregon, got almost no help because they're so overloaded. a lot of homless flock there, even the most radical leftists that i know are starting to get tired of the homeless population. go elsewhere, both for the cold/constant rain this winter and for the lack of resources.   unless you are willing to camp deep in the forest, stay sober, and clean up after yourself, i would suggest staying away. too easy to get into drugs, too easy to get sucked into trouble being homeless up there.
z989kx,,iyi39e8,What, that's a letdown for the state. I don't do drugs or alcohol. Would that improve my chances or is it a lost cause now in Or? Anywhere else you'd recommend to someone who hasn't been further than Texas and wants to get to West Coast or even Az or Co? I'm trying to leave east coast and esp the winters of Midwest. I want to start driving out and having some cities on my radar to check and see if I like would be great
z989kx,,iyj78eb,I'm in Eugene, I'm homeless, i don't use any of the local resources, if you need assistance it's very crowded and personally working a full time job i just don't have the time to do both. So I work and don't use any social services. If you're self reliant it isn't so bad, the few times the police have bothered me they were very chill and had better things to do once they realized I wasn't an addict. However rent is crazy just like everywhere else, $1500 studios and etc.
z989kx,iyfltsc,,You're gonna hate Oregon right now if you're living outside. Portland is awesome in the dry and warm weather though! Eugene kind of sucks for an extended stay but they have cool punk/ metal shows a couple times a week regardless.
z989kx,,iyi2yxk,I heard Oregon and Washington were too for social services and getting help on your feet or just not hassled being in a car. Why right now not great? Weather? I have a car possible upgrade to small sedan. And now told about met .. not looking to be attacked
z989kx,iyh3ex4,,Just checked; it will drop to freezing for the next week. Nigh-time temps:   31, 34, 34, 28, 34, 35, 32.  Most of the winter there is typical.  Very cold & rainy.  Sometimes snow.  Go South.
z989kx,,iyi3n9u,Wow thanks for the heads up. Thought close to the coast would keep the coastline warmer like Western Europe. Any cities you'd recommend I check out and look into, even out of state of further inland like Az or Co? Mostly looking to live in v√©hicules until I retrain for IT and find a cheap studio. I dont need much, simple frugal man happy with minimalist lifestyle. East coast metropolis is not the way to do if

z989kx,iyh0gri,,if you dont mind the cold and rain and wind and (potential) snow.. sure go to oregon. portland has more resources but eugene would have less people.
z989kx,,iyiakgm,Portland's resources are maxed out.  The increase in homelessness has strained the underserved population.  Portlander's are going through compassion fatigue. The increase in homelessness has coincided with an increase in crime, assaults, unsanctioned camps, dirty discarded needles, garbage and human waste throughout the city.  Businesses are closing and longtime residents are leaving.  Portland's city council just passed a ruling to create large, sanctioned camping sites with support services and will be outlawing unsanctioned camping.
z989kx,iyj3219,,Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt.  I thought that was going to be the answer for us. We drive from Virginia to Oregon. Worse choice ever. If you have any sort of income find one of those places that sell raw land in the middle of the US in the middle of nowhere and get a chunk you can afford. Get way back off the road and dig in like a tick.   After almost ten years on the road we finally have some stability. Still in a tent but no worries someone is going to come chase us off. It‚Äôs our land. Even got chickens they eat the bugs and we eat them lol

z989kx,iyfil16,,I lived in Eugene. It‚Äôs the most densely populated homeless area in the country. Plenty of places to eat. It might be the easiest place to be homeless.
z989kx,,iyi3e55,How does the homeless and college student population clash? And why isn't Portland more homeless? Anywhere else in Or or Wash you'd recommend?
z989kx,,iyi4lyl,The college students don‚Äôt clash with the homeless. A lot of them give money away and or are scared of the more mentally ill ones but otherwise they just ignore each other. Eugene‚Äôs population is much smaller than Portland. I said it‚Äôs by density not by total numbers.
z989kx,iygs3dm,,Super overbooked last year due to Covid.
z989kx,iyiruly,,Lived in Eugene for a good while on and off.  They have an incredible homeless shelter there called the "Eugene Mission" that'll help you get on your feet again. They'll provide you with everything you need as long as you can follow some simple rules.  You don't want to be outside right now in Oregon though due to the weather.  If you have any questions just ask. I know a lot about the area.

z95p26,iyhq46j,,I‚Äôd love to know where you live that you can get a bed in the hospital, period. Because I was told I could wait 3 days in the ER last time or just go home because even then there probably wouldn‚Äôt be a psych bed available in the entire state.   So I‚Äôm always side eyeing the idea that people are just using psych hospitals like hotels from the elements.
z95p26,,iyi29in,Virginia. Stayed in er for 2 days wisting for bed then send 3 hours to a shitty place in Richmond that made me worst and traumatized me .. the great beds are in northern Virginia and full
z95p26,,iyi3eer,I‚Äôm sorry that sounds like hell. I ended up just leaving under the 24/7 care of my spouse which was pure luck he was able to do that for several days. Otherwise I probably would have just rotted in the ER waiting for a bed.
z95p26,,iyi59z6,Wow, everyone I knew in the mental ward in Richmond stayed 3 days in er and asked to leave and got a TDO (told they were danger and had to stay and be moved to the shitty place). They were going to do the same to me when I asked to leave but decided to stay "voluntarily" and not involve judges. Most people stayed 2-3 days in er, can't tell if it was thanksgiving or if was year round. One guy had been 8 times in mental wards and said usually not that long to get a bed and usually stay in area but will transport you to first bed even if it's on the TN border and youre across state by DC .. he did say the cold (he loved in a tent) was main reason he asked for help, he def had mental issues but the trigger was the cold that made him go into hospitals
z95p26,,iyi7e0z,Like most states mine is critically overwhelmed with news for psych beds and we have like one state facility I think? At best‚Ä¶maybe some private ones but it is GRIM if you need major psychiatric care here.
z95p26,,iyi8471,Sadly everyone said the psych hospital was not therapeutic and actually traumatizing. The good hospitals by DC were just full. In the end I was out of the cold and.not paying expensive hotel for a week. But at the cost of some new PTSD on top of one's I had. It was very rough. Lit everyone was like this is awful but we're out of the cold and have a bed. Everything else was very negative.
z95p26,iyt78j3,,Absolutely! Use to do it all the time when I was homeless. In NYC till I found out my bills were racking up lol
z95p26,iypgdpx,,I almost did this myself. It got so cold one night, and I think it broke me because now whenever I get cold I really start to panic. I really don't like it.
z91td0,iyg6eh3,,There was one spot I lived at for awhile where there were little small field mice, but they were the most polite mice in the world. They never chewed holes in the tent, they would just wait for the door to be open.   Once when my dog was about a year old a mouse had gone into the tent while the dog and I were out for a walk. When we got back my dog was going nuts trying to find it, he was pawing things, trying to sniff behind stuff, but he couldn‚Äôt find it and finally tired himself out and gave up. So not long after the dog falls asleep I‚Äôm just sitting on my bed on my phone and this tiny little mouse peeks out from behind a crate. He looks at the sleeping dog, looks at me and then sprints for the open door. Unfortunately the door was one of those ones that are about 8-9 inches up from the floor. Because of the angle of the tent walls he had been able to get **in** the tent, but now couldn‚Äôt get **out.** So very quietly and carefully, so I wouldn‚Äôt wake the dog I started putting stuff in front of the door making a sort of ramp. Thankfully the mouse seemed to understand because as soon as I finished and backed away back to my bed he ran out and scurried up the ramp to freedom and my dog had no idea.
z91td0,,iygcr6m,That was what these mice were doing at first, too! I used to not fully close the door all the way but the ex was a dick about it. But when they got desperate enough, they eventually started chewing holes. One of the mice that got really big and I think a smaller one died because we got them out and they were stuck in the garden for a few days, and the smaller ones were literally born in the tent inside the shoebox I had my interview shoes (I gave up on interviewing because the mask mandate dropped.).

z91td0,,iygc5b8,No. The plague is transferred by fleas and we would have had the plague a year ago. The encampment a block over is in worse shape and they would have gotten sick as well. The apartment building I lived in was infested with rodents and no one who lived there got it either.
z91td0,iyei0bk,,I threw the traps out because it was too painful to even look at them. And after what happened, I'm never going to set out those same traps again, lest one of the survivors has to keep looking at it and remember as well.  Also, it turns out they come out whenever the ex smokes. Maybe the secondhand weed calms them.
z91td0,iyeka5v,,Make a mouse taco
z91td0,,iyeo01t,No. I love himb!
z91td0,,iyeqqik,One minute you love em the next minute you‚Äôre trapping em
z91td0,,iyeysio,Yes, to get them out of the tent. When we trap them, we patch up the holes and then release them outside.
z91td0,,iyg27lu,It'sa my mama's recipe
z91td0,iyfifq5,,There's humane traps that simply trap them into a box for you to relocate
z91td0,,iyfmped,I used a mouse motel. But one of the mice still suffocated in one of them in a hot day. Between the trauma and lass among the mice and I, I decided it was best to throw the traps away. I am never using another trap that looks like those to limit reminders of the incident to the surviving mice and I.
z91td0,iyiafs7,,Awww kill it! It can carry disease
z91td0,,iyjiuhd,I am not a murderer.
z91td0,iyf8mxi,,Keep your food in a tightly sealed, waterproof plastic bin and you‚Äôll have no reason for mice to come in.
z91td0,,iyfeo7a,I do. They still come in anyway. The ex got Mexican food last night and today I found them breaking into a bag of chips it turns out he never finished and left on the floor. I keep my food between 2 plastic bins and trash bags for the rest. Sometimes workers or church people give us pure packaged snacks and the mice will get into the snacks within a matter of minutes. When we get bags of snacks for church people I leave them for the ex, but he just leaves them untouched, sitting in the floor despite saying he will eat them.  Some things I just keep in the Amazon Fresh bags and the mice almost never get into those, but it's mostly fully sealed packaged food and nonfood items. I was given a paper bag with a notebook and pens in it (no food), and I saw momma mouse climb into and stand ontop of a gallon water bottle looking at it, but she never jumped in.  Whenever I do a full cleanup, they'll stay away for almost a week unless a smelly food is brought in or something they really like such as peanuts are placed close to the "wall" by where they tunnel and run around. The holes are always on the ex's side under his clothes which he never cleans up. Whenever I clean it, I have to deal with all of his drug stuff because he smokes weed (which the mice love and also try to get into), and the fillings and butts of the switshers he uses the wrappers of to roll weed. The problem is I hate cleaning up poop and I always run out of Clorox wipes. Even if I don't run out of them, I end up running out of baby wipes or hand sanitizer and get stuck using the chlorox wipes for things they shouldn't be used for.  They're also smart, and they will come in and look around for food regardless. I keep meaning to order super grains off Amazon Fresh ($3.69 for a lb of tiny grains they will eat) to leave outside as a deterrent so they won't eat all of the plants in my garden (One reason why I have hardly any crops.) when they can't find or get anything from the tent. Mice starve to death in as little as 4 days of not eating, so they're just going to ravage my garden if they lose access to food. The ex has witnessed them going from pot to pot to look at the different plants to see what they can eat.
z91td0,,iyg2ccs,Every time somebody says "this food is for the wild animals so they don't eat my food" I cringe.
z91td0,,iygdnjy,Well it's that or they keep breaking into my tent and destroying my garden. When they're removed from the tent and it gets sealed, they go ham on the plants.
z91td0,,iyg2gce,Mice will chew through plastic buckets.
z91td0,,iyi116e,Not if they‚Äôre hard plastic and tightly sealed
z8ttfn,iydqt8p,,Yup. And yesterday a judge lifted the restraining order against busting up a huge camp in San Jose. Hundreds of people will be scattered and lose their possessions and their homes because they cant carry it out with them.  The New York law is based on the one that Gavin Newsom recently pushed a to force homeless people into treatment against their will if it is "deemed necessary. " Who gets to decide what's necessary? The arresting officer. Yup. California is stepping up their war on the homeless.
z8ttfn,,iyfcx8a,Gotta keep your Camp clean if you want to avoid a sweep.   And buying non running RV's and parking them doesn't work anymore.  Cities are hip to that.  Don't allow tweakers in your camp.  No stealing bikes,, car parts,, amazon packages, etc allowed.  Treat your Camp like a community and it will go a long way when you need help to stay there.
z8ttfn,,iygn15q,> Who gets to decide what's necessary? The arresting officer.  No, the arresting officer does not get to decide.  He merely gets to say that he thinks that it is necessary.  A JUDGE DECIDES.  And when the judge makes their judgement, the detained person has the right to a lawyer.  If he can't afford one, the taxpayers pay for one for him.
z8ttfn,,iyhtqh2,No, this is not a criminal case. A person is not being charged with a crime. If an officer deems a person "unstable" then the person must prove TO THE OFFICER that they are in treatment for substance abuse or mental illness and if they cannot, an officer will detain them and place them in a residential treatment facility NOT JAIL...this is not a criminal proceeding. This is not a non compos mentis hearing. If you're wondering how this is not a violation of constitutional right...well, yeah, that's exactly the problem.
z8ttfn,,iyh9czd,Detained? Sounds like an arrest
z8ttfn,,iyhzw8r,‚ÄúTaxpayer‚Äù like Elon musk who doesn‚Äôt pat taxes? You are a horrible excuse for a human what are you doing on here troll?
z8ttfn,iyewcf5,,I am for the program in NYC and the one in Cali that will court commit people to outpatient treatment. The latter will also give housing. It isn't right for mentally ill people who can't take care of themselves to be suffering in the street.
z8ttfn,,iyex53c,Rounding up people the pigs deem mentally ill and forcing them to be institutionalized is actually a bad thing. Believe it or not.
z8ttfn,,iyeytjc,NY has not built more institutions, so no worries there. But some need to be in them. We, as a nation, and Canada too, need more of all of it. Affordable housing/community outpatient care for those who can live on their own. Housing for those that need some supervision and more support. Group homes as the next level, but some yes need a hospital shorter or longer term.
z8ttfn,,iyf1c88,Housing and healthcare is perfectly fine. What I take issue with is when police deem someone to be mentally ill and force them into being hospitalized against their will. That will get a lot of people hurt or killed.
z8ttfn,,iyf3t85,It‚Äôs not just police.  It‚Äôs any number of public service entities, and they are being provided with access to consultations with trained professionals.     It‚Äôs naive not to recognize that police are often the first point of contact between the mentally ill and public services.  This gives the police an option other than incarceration for dealing with people who should not be on the streets.   It‚Äôs not like a police officer wields more power than just getting a person initially referrers to the mental health system where they can receive a professional evaluation.
z8ttfn,,iyf3xdg,I understand. The problem is people getting hurt and killed by people living in the subway. The article I read about it said clinicians are being sent in with police, but police have always had authority to put on 72 hour holds
z8ttfn,,iyhrs6v,In this spiraling out of control society brought forth by lawyers to protect the white collar criminals, the police are simply the hunting dog that is complicit to the hunter..  That role is the out of control lawyers and gangsters in black robes being the judges.  Along with d.a.'s.  This is absolutely alarming.  They wanted mentally ill people running the streets to begin with.  Institutions being left abandoned decades ago speaks for itself.

z8hzo0,iybxd7q,,She needs to call 211 and start searching for help on findhelp.org. You can help her by doing research for her. If you live in a large enough city, she might be able to train with JobCorp while staying close to you.  Now this is the tough part, if she needs to be away from you in order for her to be in a better position, it's important you don't judge or put pressure on her to stay for your benefit.  That's an unfortunate but real possibility.
z8hzo0,,iybxuyj,i would never pressure her or make her feel bad if she has to go to be in a better position. and thank you for the advice. i really appreciate it
z8hzo0,,iydovid,That's very wonderful of you. It's not always apparent to people, love can blind you to the needs of others, you start to think of "us" and not "me" and "you." I hope for nothing but the best to you both.
z8hzo0,,iyufqzm,so you have any experience with job corps? it seems‚Ä¶ weird.
z8hzo0,,iyv2jcd,I went to Job Corps- I can try to answer any questions you have.
z8hzo0,,iyypw2r,what was the experience? please dm me
z8hzo0,,iyyqoyh,I shall!
z8hzo0,,iyysnxs,Sent! Though to your inbox, not to what I *think* you mean by DM
z8hzo0,,iyv2i3m,I second Job Corps. With her situation I bet she would qualify
z8hzo0,iybqkk6,,Call shelters in your area. Women shelters if you have any nearby. The Salvation Army lets people stay overnight but have to leave during the day. You have 2 weeks so get to work calling around. Look for someone that needs a roommate. Hopefully it will not come to her being on the street.
z8hzo0,,iybxwme,will do thank you sm
z8hzo0,iych7fu,,You need to go to /r/legaladvice.  If she's paying rent she's a tenant, she has rights. You have to evict tenants, I don't think 2 weeks is long enough to do it.
z8hzo0,,iydcmmh,i meant paying rent as she is basically a roommate with the mom and son. she stays with them and she pays the mom whenever she can
z8hzo0,,iydpvf8,she is still technically a tenant if she is paying money to live there.
z8hzo0,,iyigcj1,If she receives any type of mail at the residence they cannot evict her without serving notice and she has 30 days from that date good luck Bro
z8hzo0,iyc2rs4,,I‚Äôm going through the exact thing you‚Äôre going through right now. It‚Äôs so scary being on the other end‚Ä¶ the guy I love, is getting evicted as we speak. I‚Äôve given as much as I can and as much resources to help him figure something out. It‚Äôs so hard when you‚Äôve done all you can but you feel like you could do more, when there‚Äôs nothing you can really do. Stay hopeful, I‚Äôm trying so hard but I‚Äôm scared for my loved one. You guys will get through it I‚Äôm sure. I apologize that it‚Äôs not really advice. I felt like I was alone in this exact situation.

z8hzo0,iycm3ml,,Have her come live with you

z8hzo0,,iyuf2bg,have you been to job corps or have any experience? i looked it up and it seems scary and like a prison. however it is a place to get help ig. but i do want personal experience
z8hzo0,,iz9d2o5,Wow, scary and like a prison! That doesn't sound good. I started recommending the program after hearing many positive stories here on /r/homeless. After looking at it some more (bc of your comment) and specifically researching negative opinions, it seems that it varies across facilities. California has great resources, Texas is terrible. No surprises there, I suppose...  You can try researching the facilities in your state.  What I've heard the most about this program is that they are a good stepping stone if you're putting in the work. So if you are there to learn and apply yourself, then they will work hard to make things happen for you. This can include a path into community college. However, apparently they also have people joining who can opt for Job Corps instead of jail. So I wouldn't be surprised if that has an effect on the place, both in the people you'll be classmates with, and the structures that exist within the organization. It's not supposed to be a punitive place, as far as I know, but if it's used instead of jail, then I wouldn't be surprised if it is. After all, the US loves punishing poor people...  Good luck to you and your girlfriend. There is another website that I know of, www.findhelp.org that you can use to find resources in your local area.
z8hzo0,iyf8n5h,,It helps to know location, but if you're in a population dense area, the likelihood of her finding a program for transitional age youth is pretty high. Generally speaking, these programs help those between the ages of 16-26 (again, my experience and not all agencies have the same criteria). This may help when she's on sites like 211.org or findhelp.org   How are the social programs where you live? If you're in the states, is there anything like food stamps, cash aid, etc. that your gf can apply for?  Edit: typos
z8hzo0,iyfixy1,,Tell her to immediately sign up for job Corp the closest one to her even if it's out of state. She can go to school to get a trade and she can live on the premises!! They also have youth homeless shelters as well call 211.
z8hzo0,,iykvuzj,we looked at the locations and there is one in sac california(which is about an hour away from me). however she thinks that is too far and she doesn‚Äôt want to be away from me. i think this is bs because she needs what‚Äôs best for her atm.
z8hzo0,iybq168,,What's your home situation like? Why can't she move in with you?
z8hzo0,,iybxpfd,my parents are divorced. i go to my dads house during the week and my moms during the weekends. and i told them both about the situation happening and they don‚Äôt seem to care that much
z8hzo0,,iydkfcn,So force the issue. What's the worst that can happen? I'll tell you - your GF being on the streets
z8hzo0,,iydyygj,They‚Äôll kick her out for sure and likely him the second he turns 18.
z8hzo0,,iydzsxk,We don't know that for sure. Op didn't say his parents are deranged lunatics - just that they seem disinterested
z8hzo0,,iyefy71,Guy brings in girlfriend when they don‚Äôt want her there? My guess is they won‚Äôt take kindly to it
z8hzo0,,iyem5nn,He's a seventeen year old, practically a man already. What are they gonna do
z8hzo0,,iyemwkk,Boot both of them
z8hzo0,,iykw2jo,she has stayed the night once, and my mom said never again. and my dad says i should leave my gf since he thinks it‚Äôs gunna get worse and hold me back. so i think my parents wouldn‚Äôt appreciate my gf staying let alone be over anymore
z8hzo0,,iykyp2z,So buddy you're seventeen. My guess is you're either getting ready to go to college or to get a job. Either way, you ought to be thinking about getting a place soon.  Your GF ought to be important to you. If she isn't, maybe you should break it off.  Considering these two things, give her a place to stay until you figure your life out, ideally sooner than later. She has a job right? - she can help you with rent once you either make your next step or get your ass kicked out on the street. You're only going to wreck shit for the short while you stay at home with her.  It's a way better option than letting her sleep rough on the streets man. Doesn't this girl mean shit to you? Honestly seems borderline sociopathic to even be asking imo  Get a place or give her a place to stay somehow.... Not really rocket science....
z8hzo0,iyc6u6o,,People who are getting evicted like this had to have pissed off their gracious hosts. They aren't kicking them out for nothing. Something happened that we are not being told. No disrespect to OP  or others. Just saying. Best of luck to all who are facing these challenges.
z8hzo0,,iydvi6e,Not always. Sometimes it‚Äôs just because they need their own space. I hate sharing my space.
z8hzo0,,iyiv6hx,Again, if that's the case. They should of mentioned a time period like 2 weeks or a month. I understand about needing their own space. Good day.
z8hzo0,,iydyouj,The person getting kicked out?   In my experience repeated eviction and not signing into a legit lease is usually because of repeated non payment, taking advantage of the hosts/clashing with them way too much, poor financial decisions and not keeping a job, or abusive behavior. I‚Äôve seen it before with someone who myself/a roomie opened up our home to. She abused my roomie and used risk of homelessness as a way to force my roomie to keep her around.  Not wanting to share space doesn‚Äôt seem like a likely reason to be kicked out multiple times.   OP they need to first look at shelters nearby and also look on local Facebook marketplace groups for rooms for rent. If she‚Äôs working 9-5 especially if she was while living at home she should have enough funds to put up for a room on a lease.
z8hzo0,,iyennoc,[deleted]
z8hzo0,,iyf40xx,Sadly emotional trauma/mental illness is usually the reason for being homeless. Sometimes it‚Äôs trusting the wrong people or bad luck. But repeated homelessness is almost always because one needs mental heath evaluation.
z8hzo0,,iydpccb,[deleted]
z8hzo0,,iydqanu,If that's what you got from my reply that's on you. There is always more to a story that we are not being told. I can see if they said you can stay for 2 weeks whatever. Good day to you m8.
z8hzo0,iyfj6c0,,Depending on the state she likely has to be given 30 days notice.   At any rate if s eh is getting regular paychecks she should expect to pay rent. I would not pay this family any more money have her rent a room and wor out rent and util...probably with another female. I dont know what her long term goals are but she is still very young and need to figure out if she wants to go to school, be a caregiver, or get another job.   Will her family help her at all? She needs to come up with a plan that includes, work, school, or both and how much she can afford to pay in rent and find a nice roommate unti you turn 18 and move out. Good luck to her. Does she have a car? She can also donate plasma and do other things for extra money.
z8hzo0,iyfla2m,,Get a gym membership at Planet Fitness. It is an inexpensive way to get a free shower, get ready for the day and use a toilet. I would be hopping around a new fast food place each day to stay in an air conditioned environment when she isn't at work. Get a car for sleeping. Find a safe parking lot to park.   You can also rent camping spots for cheap. That way you can cook your own food and lay down without being cramped. Buy pepper spray for animals and bad guys.
z8hzo0,iyfznwp,,Can she find a live in caregiver position? Or a live in nanny position? I feel she‚Äôs well situated for this, as she already works in that field.
z8hzo0,,iyg9arm, You can make very good money as a live in nanny
z8hzo0,,iygegnm,Care.com Or if it's offered ihss
z8hzo0,iyigh55,,If the shelter doesn't work out, my advice would be finding a way for her to live in a car. Other than that, a tent.  It can help as a temporary patch. And at least get her out of the weather.  I don't know what it's like where you guys are at. But I think the way of getting her out of this situation is either through roommates. Or finding something that has enough income to pay for rent in your area.  It's also possible to find Non-Profit groups that can help her with Rental Assistance or Motel Vouchers. But it would depend on what options your area has specifically.
z8hzo0,iybty3a,,You both are at the beginning of your adult life and should think about the future as well as what is happening right now. Luckily these two things can help solve each other.  She should first of all be considered independent for tax purposes.  This opens up some possibilities. Will she turn 18 soon or is she just now 17? If the second she should look into being emancipated.  Then look into going to college. As an independent she can receive a lot more support than if she is still a dependent. Even if she goes to community College she can get support for living as well as classes. Most community or trade schools (2 years or less) will accept students at any time. Focus on a degree path that results in a real job. She will be able to have stability for herself in short order.   Another possibility is JobCorps, which will train and house young people for free.

z72fq0,iy4bes0,,Is it credit or eviction that's on his record. Places work with bad credit but not with eviction.
z72fq0,,iy4e4t7,Both, actually. My father said that once he tells them about him having such a crazy low credit score over the phone, they immediately shut him down saying something along the lines of apologizing and adding how they're afraid they can't help or be of assistance.
z72fq0,,iy5vx5y,What about buying a camper and staying at a RV Park? Is that option? If you have funds to pay year up front you can buy a camper and most Rv parks don't check your credit.
z72fq0,,iy8y0ja,This is what I was going to suggest too, especially a decent used one
z72fq0,,iy8yozi,Just dont get nothing to old.  Lot of parks dont accept any that are over 15 years old. Also take care of the roof.
z72fq0,,iy4elj5,Mhm eviction takes a while to come off if it ever does but a secured credit card would bring the credit up in months. It can be more expensive, but private owners can be good. They are far more empathetic than corporate owners. Have you tried rehousing programs?
z72fq0,,iy55h0b,The rapid rehoming programs are even worse. Most landlords don‚Äôt accept them because a lot of the people attached to them have bad backgrounds, unemployment, you name it. Their best bet is to eventually start paying off the eviction and find a legit, private landlord that‚Äôs not a scam that may rent them with a larger deposit. I don‚Äôt know. They are in a tough spot. You can‚Äôt have an eviction and expect someone to rent to you especially if you‚Äôre not paying off the eviction.
z72fq0,,iy4gg60,I'm not sure where, or how, to effectively find ANY private landlords. Do you know where/how to find one indefinitely?? Like, a legitimate website or something?  And I've done research on "rapid rehousing" as I've been suggested by Outreach people but continue to run into scams or dead ends with no response.
z72fq0,,iy4h2m8,Only place I really know would be like craigslist, apartments.com, Zillow but even with them you have to vet them. Make sure you see the apartment/house yourself, don't pay any fees until you do, build a rapport with them so that they feel confident that you can pay. You can ask local churches if they work with apartments. Also apply for rental assistance in advance just in case.
z72fq0,,iy8fpfe,Look on Facebook Marketplace for rooms to rent in a private home or rooming house. Many places won‚Äôt let two people into one room, but some do if you agree to pay a little above the stated rent rate. The security deposit is usually lower, and many say they do a credit check but don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt tell them about the eviction. This is important.  If they do a credit check they will find it and you will be beck to where you are now with no further harm done, but many do not do the credit check.
z72fq0,,iy803t6,Look around your area in person. A lot of the time people don't post their rental options online,  especially if it's someone who is older and not tech savvy. It might be cheaper too!! I'm praying for you, I know that you will make it out of this.
z72fq0,,iy5t1l2,[deleted]
z72fq0,,iy66vbw,Yes 7-10 years usually but that‚Äôs a long time to be homeless.
z72fq0,,iy6hp3v,7 i think. but it can be removed if the landlord/lawyers are nice enough to file a request. if it's an unjust eviction i would fight it.
z72fq0,,iy8sjir,Or simply pay off the eviction or make a deal to get it removed or satisfied
z72fq0,,iy5w07a,Im pretty sure its different between states and only if you paid whatever you owe.
z72fq0,iy54rgh,,First of all, there are lots of scams on private landlords. You  need to Google any address are  given and verify it is not a stolen listing. Craigslist Facebook marketplace the scams are everywhere. Make sure the address is not linked with a broker. Generally, the scam ads are very very easy to spot, but people still fall for them. They normally have out-of-state phone numbers Low rent no pet fees, utilities included, bad credit accepted , WhatsApp or cash app, blah blah blah.   Sorry you‚Äôre in this predicament but this is why maintaining decent credit is really really important. If there is an eviction on a record anywhere, it‚Äôs gonna have to be paid off. Or that person cannot be on the application. Hotels are going to drain you fast. You may want to look at a manufactured home for now, just to get caught up pay off bills and get your credit cleaned up then you no can move.  If it‚Äôs a private landlord, stop mentioning the eviction and bad credit right up front. Talk about the good clean background jobs, enough income. And start there. The eviction needs to be paid off. Is there any payments be made on it or have you tried calling the person that reported the eviction and see if you can work something off with him on a payoff? You can‚Äôt blame people for not renting to you within eviction So many people use Covid as an excuse not to pay anything I mean nothing.  Good luck I would be driving around manufactured parks right now. Also, you may look out and find somebody with a guest house willing to rent to you again make sure it‚Äôs legit and don‚Äôt send anyone any money or personal info. View the place first before you apply for anything .  I know this sucks but also you each may have to rent a room in seperate houses. Your Dad being 55+ may be able to get a nice room in a retirement community. If you 2 have to live together it will be harder to have an arrangement like that.
z72fq0,,iy6igvo,yes beware of scammers.
z72fq0,iy6waty,,Buy a used camper. Rent a space in EV park. You‚Äôll prob like it n have more security than renting. You‚Äôll meet like minded folks n get a lot of outdoor time (if u want it). It‚Äôll be ok.
z72fq0,,iy7231u,I came here to say this.   If you have the money to pay rent upfront for a year you should have enough to pay for an older rv or camper.   Full time lot rent in an an rv park is usually five or six hundred plus electricity.   You would need to buy a heated water hose, a sewer hose, and maybe insulation for skirting and a small heater to go under the RV.   You would be better off buying a larger propane tank for winter, but after that you will be set.   You can skip the skirting if you don‚Äôt hook up the water and is the rv park showers and toilets.  Good luck!
z72fq0,iy4o1t3,,I would look on craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. My ex was able to find cheap month to month housing through a FB ad while she had an eviction on her record. The guy just asked for 3 months of rent as a deposit and she lived there for 9 months.
z72fq0,,iy5nq60,Every place we applied to on Facebook turned out to be a scam. Be careful.
z72fq0,,iybksaz,Agree, Facebook marketplace is kind of a dumpster fire. I‚Äôve had no problem buying furniture on there but any time I try to sell furniture I get ten million interested messages but nobody shows up. Now that I think about it any time I have show up to buy anything from anyone the seller is always uncannily sooooo happy that I followed through ü§£  *edit, I suppose it CAN be done without scam, just never give out too much of your info to a posting. I like to say that I live in the area and name a specific thing about the area I‚Äôm in that only a REAL seller would know (like a landmark or a street name maybe something about where I used to live if it‚Äôs the same town) to let the person know I‚Äôm legit‚Ä¶ how they act after that let‚Äôs me know if they are legit‚Ä¶ never cashapp or anything in advance, I usually offer to meet up in a public place or if it‚Äôs their house I take someone with me.
z72fq0,,iyblwhp,Right? True story: we just bought a car on Facebook. We met him at the dmv, we had cash, he had a car as described. No weird story, no drama, just traded cash for a car. It runs perfectly. But at least 20 other adds were scams. They wanted us to wire money, or the money would be picked up by Fed Ex, their husband/wife/kid just died. What a bunch of nonsense and a waste of time!
z72fq0,iy65nxq,,Where in NJ are you? Try to contact Destiny's Bridge, they used to have a state sanctioned community for the homeless around the Lakewood area. I'm not sure if they still do but their website is still active so it's worth a shot.   https://www.destinysbridge.org/  https://www.facebook.com/RevBrigham
z72fq0,iy5a7z5,,That is scary. Can y'all work on your credit? Free credit builders: credit ai ( just deposit 25 dollars, you don't even have to use the card for it to report), grow if you have a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu), seedfi,,,,I'm shocked that income restricted would be this way. I was looking at the website of one last night, it said no eviction in the past year. I figured lots of their clientele would have bumps and bruises in their credit. I wish there was a social worker to navigate this for people. Maybe call a realtor for private landlords. My realtor friend helps people rent houses/ condos.
z72fq0,,iy80fi9,Calling a realtor would be a good idea
z72fq0,,iy8owdu,A realtor isn‚Äôt going to want to waste their time. They get maybe one months rent and ten percent of rental income. It‚Äôs not worth their time to do all the paperwork for a hard to place renter.
z72fq0,iy64vlc,,Are either of you working? A woman who was in the shelter with me in 2020 got her employer to vouch for her. She had bad credit and a job that paid OK but not quite enough for most landlords. But once her boss told her to have prospective landlords to call him, she had no trouble getting a place.  You might also try calling some local churches and seeing if anyone in their congregations will rent to you. I go to a Unitarian church, and a couple of our members have taken in homeless people.
z72fq0,iy74dc6,,>We simply can not afford to buy, or rent, a home at the moment. Is there another option for my father and I to move in somewhere that Definitely accepts bad credit OR where we can live other than with family members/friends (not an option) and get out of this horrible motel?  Yes.  As has been pointed out by many... an RV.  You've tried everything else to the point where all you are digging through is crap.  So... get a home on wheels.  Now... he ***owns*** his own home.  No renting, no vouchers, no programs.  In Washington State right now, that would mean he could park it almost anywhere, as per a recent ruling on the state's Homesteading Act, that declares a Washington registered vehicle to be a home.  But where do you park it?  Well... that depends.  RV parks, as has already been pointed out, aren't going to look at the credit score to reject a potential renter.  RV parks are an extended vacation spot.  A variation on this would be a trailer spot that has open spots, as opposed to only trailers.  You could park an RV for free on BLM land... [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/)... for two weeks at a time.  Then, you have to move to another spot 25 miles away, to continue to park for free on BLM land.  Of course... this all depends on whether or not you see a Ranger in those two weeks... and if you don't, then you stay longer until one shows up.  If you are told to move, and you don't... then you can expect a ticket and/or trouble..  There's BLM land all over the country.  Walmart is generally RV friendly when it comes to people parking overnight, friendlier than they are about cars parking overnight at any rate.  Of course, if the Walmart has No Overnight Parking signs in the lot... they aren't friendly to overnighting at all.  You could park overnight for the cost of one exit on the NJ Turnpike.  Get on before a Rest Stop, go and stay in the rest stop, and get off at the next exit the next day.  Cheaper than a motel, for sure.  No one is going to hassle an RV parked overnight at a turnpike rest stop, northbound or south.
z72fq0,,iy8t52t,Walmart is getting sued because of an RV that caught fire and killed a child in a neighboring car. For some reason Walmart has been made responsible for homeless and it‚Äôs not their problem. Out of courtesy some Walmart parking lot to do allow overnight parking but this will probably come to an end soon.
z72fq0,,iy95eo2,I wouldn't be surprised.  Their policy was initially to assist people on vacation, and truck drivers who had to sleep.  I fully admit, that the suggestion to "live" in a Walmart parking lot is abusing what Walmart intended as a "generous act" for their patrons.  They are likely regretting the decision to be that... friendly... these days.  And hopefully they are screening their managers better too.
z72fq0,iy6qa8n,,Find a shelter that accepts family. It may too late because they are probably full. But still look for a family shelter.  Cosigner's. A family member with an excellent credit score can cosign if the landlord accepts cosigners.
z72fq0,iy717d3,,Was your eviction due to nonpayment of rent? Is it in both of your names?
z72fq0,iy7knkc,,On airbnb you can rent a room for months at a time & they are fully furnished and have all utilities included. You have to pay for the entire month before it begins.
z72fq0,iy6b6k8,,Do y'all work or receive disability or? I'm asking on part because I'm curious if you need to stay in NJ.
z72fq0,iy76mrl,,Go online to look up experian and equifax and contest the derogatory items on your credit report. Clean up your credit report, it‚Äôs not that hard
z72fq0,,iy8texr,Agree. The problem is some people have little interest in cleaning up the credit they expect people just to ignore the eviction and all the horrible credit and bills they don‚Äôt pay. Horrible credit is OK. As long as you don‚Äôt have to move, buy a car or need any of life‚Äôs necessities
z72fq0,iy79vma,,I just went through the same thing with my mom, we were homeless from June of this year to  October. staying in hotels.  I had started searching in February. Both of us have bad credit and she has an eviction. We have a HCV but there's a lot of discrimination against it and no source of income or other protection laws where I'm at.  People underestimate how big of a barrier  credit screening  is for the poor when it comes to finding somewhere to live...     So every county should have a Continuium of care that offers homeless serviced and is suppose to work with you and help you secure housing. They will even pay for a hotel for you to stay in. In most counties. But  not for long. I'm not sure what county you're in but you should try to look up the CoC  for that county and see if they can help you guys if you hadn't already.  I really hope something come through for you guys.
z72fq0,iy7m17d,,Move to Wyoming. They get you set up with housing really fast. It's not that bad there. You got a bunch of national parks. Close to Denver and salt lake city.
z72fq0,iy5s3qo,,nope. buy a tent and make sure you participate in local elections. they pretty much shape the entire culture of any given neighborhood, homeless policy and programs included.  call 211 in the meantime and hope for the best ü§ûüèæ
z72fq0,,iy75l1k,This is me. I don't enjoy being a political activist but my life is on the line in every election. The poorest people feel everything first.
z72fq0,iybl6aw,,Do you have a vehicle? I would stay in the vehicle 2-3 nights a week park at truck stops rest areas shopping centers (toward the back away from the front of the store) camp at primitive camp grounds (always alternate your car camping spots never stay more than one night at a place in a 2 week period so your car doesn‚Äôt get recognized) then get a hotel for 1 day for a nice shower and warm (or cool) room and fluffy bed. Then back to 2-3 nights roughing it in the car again. It SUCKS (esp with two people) but a few days here and there going through it you will save quite a bit.
z72fq0,iyjluk1,,I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this horrific endeavor. It can be really hard to get a place with bad credit because they might not think you'll pay on time which sucks. I can help you get your credit repaired so you can finally start to see the forest through the trees. Message me for more info so I can make your life a bit easier for you and your family.
z72fq0,iy5r3p3,,Don't go to Florida
z72fq0,,iy780a3,Not disagreeing with you as I don't know jack about Floridas laws/regulations/ renting culture but why avoid Florida ?
z72fq0,,iy7cq0p,They have a lot of laws that criminalize homelessness, even if your couch surfing. My ex used to kick me out of the house all the time but because I had a verifiable address the LEOs didn't consider me homeless. Even people living out of hotels have to be careful there. I live in AZ now, and i just learned that the laws here are almost the same.
z72fq0,,iy8tkgj,Arizona did not have a homeless problem up until recently because people continue to move out here with no game plan and how they are going to afford it.
z72fq0,,iy91cod,If you did the research, you'd know how wrong you are.   Do you live in Sedona, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, or Tempe?  I ask because Phoenix (like most state capitals), Prescott, Flagstaff, Mesa, Tucson, and Nogales have always had significant homeless populations; and don't say it's because of the Hispanics or Native Americans, because they, along with other non European and non African origin people's, only make up 1/3 of the population in Arizona.   African Americans make up the 2nd largest demographic in Arizona.   White people, in general, but specifically of Anglo-Germanic origin, are the majority in Arizona.   The largest homeless demographic in Arizona, as in all 48 contiguous states, is Homeless Veterans.   Like me.   I had a plan; unfortunately my plan didn't include the wave of Californians from Silicon Valley sweeping in and buying up all the available properties that the out of state property investment companies hadn't snatched up.   I've always had a well paying job. I'm not the only one who was affected by poor city/county/state planning.   I don't care what else you have to say.
z72fq0,,iy92sd8,The homeless problem has been significantly worsened due to Covid, cost of living increase the number of factors. Our tent city homeless camp in Phoenix has never been as big as it is now. By the way I live in Gilbert we have very little homeless here because first of all we have little public transportation, the homeless tend to congregate around the light rail area in public transportation. Which is why most people do not want to see a train come through Gilbert.  And yes, Californians, and all the transplants that moved here have ruined the housing market. And if you don‚Äôt care about anything, I have to say they just don‚Äôt respond. Thanks but there‚Äôs a reason why you‚Äôre homeless and it‚Äôs probably because of something you did or did not do. If I were you move someplace cheaper, Arizona is clearly not affordable to you .
z72fq0,izwv6dv,,I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôm thinking of buying a cheap car and living out of it
z6llnr,iy8t9ig,,Define "best".  No... seriously.  Define it.  What is best for you, is not best for the next person.  Is a hot place the "best" place to be homeless, if you can't stand the heat?  Is the "best" place one where you see lots of cops, but they don't hassle you... or is it "best" if you never see cops at all?  Is a place the "best" if there are tons of resources available for homeless people, but you have to travel around the city all the time to access those resources?  Or would a city be the "best" if there were virtually no official resources, but there was access to unofficial food and basic shelter?  **Disclaimer: This is not a recommendation**.  What if there was a place where you could... do pretty much whatever you wanted, and you could build yourself a "home" on a piece of land that no one was going to make you pay for, and you could build that "home" out of pallets if you chose to, because there were no building codes to follow.  What if there was a place where your neighbors are all doing the same kind of thing... so you never have to deal with homed people giving you shit.  What if there was free food and water available?  What if there was specific socialization going on... music, fun, partying... whenever you felt like joining in, but otherwise you were left alone to do your own thing?  What if you could come and go from that place as you chose?  What if the population of this place dropped to about 150 people in the summer, and rose to around 500-800 in the winter, constantly offering the possibility of travelling without having to drive, because there would always be someone coming through that lived out of their vehicle, and would gladly offer you a seat for weeks/months if you chose?  What if you could live in that place for years without ever paying rent or a utility bill or a mortgage... or even having to get any kind of job?  Would that be considered one of the "best" places to be homeless?  Because there is a place... just like all of that... in California.  I'm not recommending this place... for a plethora of reasons.  I'm asking if YOU would consider a place like this to be the "best" place to be homeless?  For some... the best place to be homeless, is where there are a ton of jobs they have talents for, and thus they will be able to find work.  For others, the best place to be homeless, is where there is an abundance of low income housing and trailer parks, where they can afford to pay for housing... because they can't work and can only afford cheap housing.  For still others... the best place to be homeless, is where they don't get hassled for being homeless.  For still others, the best place to be homeless is decided by the weather.  And there are those who decide what is "best", by the available resources in an area for the homeless.  Kinda nice when the soup kitchen you go to, also has a free shower for you in the morning, and you can drop off your laundry by 10 and pick it up by 2, also for free.  And the food bank is next door.  That's Olympia, the state capitol of Washington state.  No housing or jobs to speak of... the area is heavily saturated.  But you'd be clean and fed every day... for sure.  So.... what defines "best"?  Is it the best if you can \*BE\* homeless there and be comfortable... or is it \*best\* if you get out of being homeless quickly by being there?  EDIT:  Don't ask for generics... be specific.  What do \*you\* want out of the place where you will be homeless?
z6llnr,,iyg5uiw,Wow I plan on moving to Washington relatively soon. I guess I will head to Olympia if I am still can't afford a place of my own at that point of time.
z6llnr,iy6y2u5,,I came to the Bay Area nearly 15 years ago because I heard it was better than Portland. I wouldn't say it was better. Certainly not it's pretty difficult. Yes, the weather is great and liberal politics,  BUT people are a little two faced when it comes to the caring.  Yeah, Glide is great, st. Vinnies is great, lot of nice groups and parks are cool, but they're trying to squeeze us out. A lot of camps here in the east bay and in the city have been been swept out. CalTrans and local politicians all talking about it being a safety hazard with fires and stuff, but what it really is is that people don't want to see my tent in front of their condo that they just dropped a couple million on. You're not going to see any tents in front of Libby Shaffs house or London Breeds house, the homeless aren't even allowed to walk in the same neighborhood as Nancy Pelosis house. Yeah, they talk a big game, but when the time comes, the stuff you can't carry out of the camp goes in a landfill.   I've heard similar stories of people who've come from the south. Venice Beach, San Diego,  San Luis obispo, Santa Barbara,  all gorgeous weather, very liberal politics but people are being forced out by NIMBYS.    Hey, there's always the folks on the I-10, camps that are out in the Palo Verde from San Bernie to Slab City. Up north in Eureka it's an OK vibe. Santa Cruz always felt nice, but I definitely got a whole, "this ain't your territory vibe from camps down there.  I don't know, maybe Vegas is the answer?
z6llnr,iyi27vc,,I was homeless in long beach I lived under an underpass off of San Gabriel River,  I was able to fish around Alamitos Bay and Belmont Pier so I could get food. I grew plants along the riverbed so I can have tomatoes, peppers onions things like that lots of backyards had fruit trees that I can readily pick. the weather wasn't horrible it didn't get extremely cold there was usually a chill in here but it wasn't freezing. They Have showers at the beach  it ain't hot but you can still clean yourself up. This was in the 90's so things might have changed.
z6llnr,iypd4xw,,Every single big or small town is their own beasts in their own ways. One or two constnats though anywhere you end up is that the grass will always be greener on the other side and that there is absolutely no fun at all allowed.

z6m3kl,iy35vrx,,What happened is the lie that only ‚Äòbad‚Äô people or people who ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô it end up homeless. People who so drugs still deserve housing. It‚Äôs rough but many of us didn‚Äôt doooo anything wrong other than exist in a system inherently stacked against those already poor.  Do you need any resources for your area? Winter if you live in an area with it coming on hard now, is no joke and you will need to prepare asap if you haven‚Äôt.   I will say this as a gentle after thought because I get you are probably freaking out. Please consider your internalized mindset that ‚ÄòI‚Äôm one of the good ones I don‚Äôt even do drugs‚Äô has been festering in your brain.  You are no better or worse than any other person living rough. We all deserve housing and the dignity of that. If being homeless had ANYTHING at all to do with being good or bad or doing right or wrong you‚Äôd see a lot of homeless politicians but here we are.
z6m3kl,,iy3p3p4,Agreed. Addiction is a disease that starts out as a coping mechanism. Many people shit on mentally ill or addicted homeless people, when in reality there is nothing inherently bad about mental illness or addiction that makes it so those people deserve to suffer. What they deserve is treatment and rehabilitation. I am mentally ill and formerly an addict, and homeless, and yet I work two jobs, take care of my pet cat, try to provide for my girlfriend as best as a I can, and strive to lead a better life. Many people refuse to understand we are human too.
z6m3kl,,iy3rwyv,It‚Äôs very true but I think that you‚Äôd be a good person even if you didn‚Äôt work two jobs and live a socially acceptable life.   My thoughts on the disease model of addiction have evolved over time so I‚Äôm not sure where I stand on that aspect of it. But agree yes we are all worthy of dignity and respect. Mental illness, drug use, inability to hold a job or pay for housing imo should never be a barrier to housing and housing first models WORK and Finland isn‚Äôt the only model for them working.
z6m3kl,,iy3snns,I attempt to hide socially unacceptable parts of my life to earn respect from others, but fundamentally I agree with you. Respect goes a long way and from it you can reap assistance and rewards. There's a fine line to tread between pity and respect in order for people to help you. I wish it didn't have to be this balancing act, but unfortunately that's just how society is structured. I hope someday the US puts programs in place that other countries use to help their homeless, criminals, addicts, and mentally ill. Just shoving us out of sight and punishing us does nothing to help and just makes the problem worse. I don't think I'll ever live to see that day though.
z6m3kl,,iy3t44y,It‚Äôs very true. My own homeless situation need abruptly and in a unique way but part of it involved me understanding that people like tragedy porn and if you want someone to help you their pity is probably going to motivate them to do it.   Basically people needed to see me suffering to help and it worked but I knew this concept before hand and so played up the fact that people wanted to see and know the worst aspects of my life before they‚Äôd help.  It felt disgusting and gross tbh but better than being homeless I suppose. I shower whenever I want now and You know what I mean when I say that‚Äôs like the best thing in the world.
z6m3kl,iy3yw3p,,Homelessness is a threat over the working class. Even with a million in the bank, you're closer to being homeless than you're not, all it takes is someone in your family getting cancer and that moneys gone.  I'm sorry you're finding yourself a victim of this system like this, it's not right, housing should be though, everyone should be housed.
z6m3kl,iy4ws0l,,In times of prosperity (like 90s America), it was a lot harder to become homeless in general. Most homeless people were severe addicts or untreated mentally ill people. Because back then, as long as you could hold down something little and part time, you could keep a studio apartment and food in your belly. Even drive a POS car.   We still talk like it's the 90s. Soooo many Americans are maybe not one, but 2-3 missed paychecks away from being evicted. It's not the 90s anymore, 40 hours a week doesn't guarantee you housing, let alone food and medical care. Some people work 60 hours a week and yes most of them are housed, but I know people who work like dogs and haven't seen a dentist in over a decade because it's too expensive.   It's easier for people to fault those struggling instead of accepting that they could be next.
z6m3kl,iy5v0n6,,If you have a vehicle start there. I live in my van.
z6m3kl,iy2vsve,,Being poor sucks :(
z6m3kl,iy5m72s,,Been there done that. Not working and traversing 5 miles daily to the local food bank and soup kitchen was the same dead end rut as working a job that pays dirt. My quality of life is about the same. I'm trapped. No way out.
z6m3kl,iy2hnk7,,People got greedy. Got worse with the pandemic for some reason. I got rennovicted twice and illegally evicted a couple years ago and gave up. I do drugs though. Just not hard drugs and not really something I do all the time. Weekend joints or the odd acid trip. Addicts can make your situation more difficult as things tend to dissappear around them. Don't stop working. Don't give up. And don't loose important belongings. Get a storage locker at least. Don't let anyone take advantage of you. Save your money.
z6m3kl,iy5x2di,,First off that's insulting to homeless people to think they don't work and do drugs and not true of most homeless people. About 1/3 of homeless do drugs and 1/5 have jobs but most are homeless because they lost their jobs and it's hard to work and be clean enough to have a job when you have no shower and get little sleep on the streets.
z6m3kl,iy6hfd2,,I‚Äôve never drank, or done any drugs. Sometimes things happen.
z6m3kl,iy93qev,,You made some bad choices along the way... you expected more from the world than you should have... you work on assumptions more than facts... you didn't change or adapt to your environment fast enough...  ... I'd start with those concepts.  I know you made some bad choices along the way... because I can safely say that almost everyone on the planet has made some bad choices at one time or another in their lives.  Of course... the consequences from those choices will vary greatly... as we are talking globally.  But at least identifying the bad choices and why you made them initially, can help you from repeating those same mistakes, when having to make those choices in the future.  I know you expected more from the world than you should have, because you expected us here to know how you got to where you are, without knowing at least SOME of the rough details for the landscape.  Going homeless in NYC?  That's one thing and easy to imagine and sympathize with.  Going homeless in Nowhereville, population 27?  That's another thing entirely and only raises questions... and offers very different obstacles.  What if you have a job, and you don't do drugs, and you are about to be homeless because you beat your significant other one too many times... or because you refuse to pay your parent's the money they want for rent... or you've lived with your grandmother for years and she just died and all her stuff went to the state instead of you?  What went wrong.... would be very different in each of those situations.  I know you work on assumptions more than facts.. because you thought the fact that you don't do drugs has some direct connection to how you \***should not**\* be homeless.  That little bit says a LOT about what kind of people you assume make up the homeless community.  It also shows what you assume about the people who make up the **homed** community... like doing drugs makes you homeless.  I know you don't adapt or change to your environment fast enough, because the likelihood that your impending homelessness happened without some kind of warning or signs is very low.  I acknowledge that this \*can\* happen out of the blue... and people will tell stories about it happening to them that quickly... but many of those stories always leave out a few details that indicate there was time to avoid being homeless.  Again... this doesn't mean it doesn't HAPPEN with no warning.  However... your post here is not a sign of adaptation to your new situation.  Adaptation is moving forward... well... progression.  You are asking about the past... going backward.  Sure... some therapy involves going backwards... but then you are going over the specific details of the past, and picking them apart painfully.  You aren't doing that here.  So I'd start by looking at these four potential trouble spots.  If you can be honest with yourself, instead of lashing out in anger, you may be able to find a few places to make some course corrections and get back on your feet.
z6m3kl,iy32b6s,,Late stage capitalism , welcome to fascism. Please ignore the ignorant fascist blaming working people , they've been propagandized and are clueless.  The problem = Capitalism , fails 100% of the time and leads to fascism   Capitalists = Billionaires = Mentally ill psychopaths' that have no empathy which makes them excel in a system (Capitalism) that relies on exploitation .  The reason nothing changes and gets worse = The U.S. is an oligarchy ruled by Capitalists (Billionaires) Politicians are ACTORS doing the bidding of the rich.   Jeff Bezos has enough money to end homelessness and still have 150 BILLION LEFT!  Billionaires are the problem .
z6m3kl,,iy950yg,>a system (Capitalism) that relies on exploitation  If you believe that someone must be exploited, then you are missing lots of opportunities, and thereby screwing yourself.  **The world is not a zero sum game.**  Just because someone makes a profit, that does not mean that someone else must take a loss.  I've seen several people - including myself - work their way out of poverty by simply taking deals that were available.  They didn't ask if they were getting exploited.  They merely asked "Does this make my situation better?"  If I buy a burger at McD's, I am not being exploited.  I want the burger&coke more than I want ten bucks.  From my point of view, I win.  The franchise owner wants ten bucks more than he wants a burger and coke.  From his point of view, he wins. We both walk away from the deal feeling like we have come out ahead.  This is repeated millions of times every day.  People make deals.  They trade labor or cash, or cigs, or whatever.  And each of them sees themself better after the deal than before.  If you look at other people like this, you will be able to engage in deals in which you both come away better.  But if you persist in believing that someone must be exploited, you are just hurting yourself.
z6m3kl,,iz2gmkb,Directed at Me?!?  Exploiting wha- I'm lost
z6m3kl,,iy6gl6e,You haven't got a clue.  Capitalism has been dead for quite a good while.  We're on the same side.  BUT... What you're seeing and why you're upset is not capitalism.  It's closer to imperialism.
z6m3kl,iy6c8q4,,American Capitalism is pricing working people out of being able to have a roof over their head...
z6m3kl,iy3i2eg,,Only uou can answer that question.  Get somewhere that's quiet to think hard about it.  A pro tip. Not at a shelter.  Sleep in your car or find a really great camp.
z6m3kl,,iy6zi2n,I‚Äôm liking this pro tip and that OP is questioning this very thing.  Safety and quiet, to sort it out.  If it helps, maybe write or draw to better understand the situation. (I‚Äôm better with visuals).
z6m3kl,iy5owtp,,Same! If it‚Äôs any consolation, people are much much nicer to you if you‚Äôre just down on your luck vs the guys drinking all day not helping themselves.  I have met so many kind people in my voyage
z6m3kl,iy9oc6h,,Same man bad luck ig
z6m3kl,iyp42w5,,Yeah. It sucks being disparagingly called a drug user. They don't even give a fuck about drug addiction. The housed just use it as a term of abuse and an excuse to not help...
z6m3kl,iy4auj0,,Cause it's the drugs and not society that causes homeless. Wtf, you're are still getting brainwashed by a society that has zero care
z6m3kl,iy5rglm,,lol yes because only people who dont work and do drugs can become homeless. also, wrestling isnt fake and the tooth fairy is real.
z6m3kl,iy2eko6,,This is gonna be hard to accept, but listen to me, because I'm in the same boat.   You didn't plan accordingly.   It's not simply that life throws you a curve ball. Sometimes, it's almost impossible to prepare for.   When. I was 16yo, i opened my own bank acct w $1k. I didn't know I needed to be 18yo or have an adult family member w me, so, when I did turn 18yo, the banks automated system corrected for what it thought was a clerical error.
z6m3kl,,iy3se4n,In one breath you tell this person they didn‚Äôt ‚Äòplan‚Äô well enough as if one medical disaster wouldn‚Äôt send even a well off person potentially to the streets.   In the next breath you said the opposite, life throws curveballs and you can‚Äôt prepare for them.   Might want to figure out your own thoughts before posting my friend.
z6m3kl,,iy46jjt,You gotta plan for curve balls. You gotta realize there will be some absolutely random things happen in your life and you've gotta do your best to plan for that. And, at the end of the day, sometimes all our plans are not enough. It's a hard pill to swallow. In my case, as a teenager, I lost over $2k because the person who opened my acct ignored my age at the time. It might've been a scam on his part to be honest, because he still worked at that branch at the time and he was fired over the issue. In the end, it's something I could've planned for, but didn't.  It's a curve ball that drastically affected my life, and, as well as I've done to plan for other crazy issues, I've been hit with a few.  It's frustrating, but that's just how it is, unfortunately.  Like i said, it's a hard pill to swallow. It was hard for me.
z6m3kl,iykqk29,,So to the writer of the post, what happened in your situation , I mean with your living arrangement ,etc?
z6lzws,iy2912q,,Have you pursued collecting SSDI?  I'd be VERY curious as to the Fed's reason for rejecting someone in a wheelchair who has to use a catheter.  You've got to have a mountain of paperwork by now that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are disabled.  [The Section 811 housing program](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/mfh/progdesc/disab811) from HUD for the disabled (not the same as Section 8) seems to have been made for you.  Utah has this [Shelter Plus Care program](https://jobs.utah.gov/housing/scso/spc/index.html) that connects multiple different programs geared toward assisting disabled homeless.  Here is a [collection of organizations](https://slco.org/homeless-services/resource-directory/housing-rental-assistance/) providing housing and rental assistance in Salt Lake County.  So... [get that paperwork going on collecting SSDI](https://www.ssa.gov/applyfordisability/), and find yourself some of the assistance that is in Utah for helping disabled homeless.
z6lzws,,iy67cqv,>I'd be VERY curious as to the Fed's reason for rejecting someone in a wheelchair who has to use a catheter.   I'm guessing it has something to do with this: "The Social Security Administration will not grant disability benefits to people with disabilities that have been caused or worsened by addiction."  OP got stoned and jumped out of a 5th floor window. And he's still using today.
z6lzws,,iy72zto,Well... damn.  I guess that'll do it... both on getting turned down for SSDI, and for what put them in the wheelchair.  I'm guessing that they are pretty much left with church-based charity... since all the official stuff is off the table.  That, or finding a place like here.  They wouldn't be the first disabled out here that did something to affect whether or not they could get benefits.    You can't collect when a train you were hopping cuts off your leg either.  That was Bing.  She also tried personally sewing her own mouth shut too... years after when she came here.   Don't know how deeply the two events are connected... but it was interesting to say the least.  I guess I can also understand why the OP didn't include this kind of information, as it does have an effect on the landscape.
z6lzws,iy363mz,,Soft begging is not allowed on this sub fwiw.

z6kjs0,iy226jr,,Howdy. I'm in Northern IL, near the border and the lake. If you need tips on local resources, parks, or food banks let me know. I camped up here for quite a while before bumbling my way into bricks and sticks.
z6kjs0,,iyatdp1,Please DM me. I've got stuff figured out thankfully, but never hurts with more input.
z6kjs0,,iyb973z,Thanks for the award!
z6kjs0,,iyb9ovc,You're welcome üëç
z6kjs0,,iycwwsd,How do u keep it warm inside? üò©
z6kjs0,,iz8cg9w,Truthfully a lot of it has to do with growing up rough and poor. I'm used to the struggle. I'd recommend a mummy sleeping bag rated for zero degrees. Thermal base layer and gonna get a heated vest powered via USB soon too. I'm always looking to improve my situation yet willing to accept discomfort.
z6kjs0,,izbdsyu,Sometimes I wish I had grown up homeless so I never knew what being comfortable is. I got a feeling many of us are about to learn what it‚Äôs like to be living in cold or otherwise harsh environments soon, as the economy gets worse and worse.
z6kjs0,,j04roks,Totally agree that we all need to prep. I came from low then worked my ass off to feel comfort and abused it instead of showing true appreciation. Same time being here in America can't pretend to suffer in my case. We struggle more from mental health standpoint and not access to resources. In terms of survivability everyone should learn about camping and survival basics. Getting over stigma of dumpster diving and idea that need to take a shower everyday. The ability to be able to transport your life such as living out of a rucksack backpack, etc.
z6kjs0,iy2t3fp,,I would highly recommend a camo tarp of sorts (not homeless but I like to camp in places I‚Äôm not allowed) and neon green and teal do not mix in with the surrounding brush anywhere in the world, so if you worry about being found and kicked out of where you are I‚Äôd recommend a camo tarp to help lengthen your stay at your spot as it would be harder to spot you in day light and even harder to spot you in night
z6kjs0,,iy52ccb,I second this. People can stare directly at me and not see me with camouflage. I've watched troopers stare from the edge of the bush and stared at cops searching in the bush.  I don't think cops like the bush too much. They were struggling in areas I got through easily with the right gear (boots, leg gaiters and overalls that can handle briar busting).
z6kjs0,,iyb223j,Totally understand and agree. Just didn't apply to me during this short period of time. Wrote more details above. Appreciate your opinion though.
z6kjs0,,iyb1w8z,Bought cheapest thing at Walmart because had almost no cash. This particular area and situation didn't matter thankfully. I was here temporarily and first time used a tent in my over year of being homeless because been in Vegas this entire year till recently. No longer using it and gave it to another homeless guy since moved off to a city far away. Truthfully my style is sleeping bag on ground.
z6kjs0,,j1gipxe,I actually really love this tent. It's so roomy for the size.
z6kjs0,,j1rdnbi,Totally agree üëç
z6kjs0,iy3iv0r,,It will be colder by the water and animals and people are attracted to water also, be careful.
z6kjs0,,iyb2ab9,Agree. Thankfully didn't really apply to my situation. This was a temporary unconventional thing. For me if something works I stick with it and keep it basic.

z6kjs0,iy375gv,,Looks like a nice spot. Make sure you have a tarp between your tent and the ground. When I was on the street I would hit up the dumpster behind a flooring store for carpet scraps. You could almost always find at least one good sized roll. It makes nice insulation between the ground and the tarp and carpeting the floor of your tent makes it more comfortable and protects the floor.
z6kjs0,,iy460r1,Dude. Carpets the bees knees. I was in Seattle for the WTO protests and we stuck around for a few weeks after. I went with an Australian girl with a car. All our gear was there. We parted ways for a few days and found out the car got towed so we were are gearless and fearless for 4 days in Dec. One night it started snowing and there was a roll of old carpet behind a dumpster. I literally rolled myself up in it,woke up to freezing temps and 6 inches of snow but damn I was Warm(& I scared the crap outta some people crawling out if it the next morningüòÇ carpet for the win! Saved my life that night

z6kjs0,,iyb2lhv,Agree. I truthfully do enough to make myself comfortable and that's it. Temp setup and didn't wanna invest more than I had to.
z6kjs0,iy2g99e,,How do you stay warm
z6kjs0,,iyb2sq7,My style is wear a ton of clothing, sleeping bag and maybe a blanket to cover everything. I do only enough to feel comfortable, but my standards are low lol.
z6kjs0,iy3jzm2,,Get a sheet of Tyvek
z6kjs0,,iyb2z5w,Great advice, but I only do enough to make myself comfortable enough to sleep lol. Temp setup and didn't feel like putting much attention beyond basic.
z6kjs0,iy2tetb,,At least you've got a nice view man.   You off the ground? Heaps of blankets and towels?
z6kjs0,,iyb3eww,That was actually biggest perk and not seeing anyone. It was warm enough I'd been in a sleeping bag for days to scout. Not off ground, but comfy enough. Wear a ton of clothes, sleeping bag and blanket on top. Only temporary situation here.
z6kjs0,iy305cx,,Be safe!
z6kjs0,,iyb3gkz,üëçüíØ
z6kjs0,iy3qlzf,,The closer to the lake you are the warmer it is as I grew up near Chicago as having a tent is smart but adding a few extra layers wouldn't be a bad idea either if you'll be staying in a tent for the winter especially when temps can get down to 0 or below farhenheit
z6kjs0,,iyb3447,Appreciate the advice. Only temporary and was comfy enough. I don't invest beyond that.
z6kjs0,,iydmpil,No problem I m from the state originally
z6kjs0,,iz8c5ln,‚úåÔ∏è feel free to chime in whenever
z6kjs0,iy51irj,,Be careful. Waters can rise very quickly, forcing you to relocate. Also, many people follow the river looking for what you've found. The flood plains are go-to spots.

z6kjs0,,iyb4kz7,Sure was while in DeKalb.
z6kjs0,,iy52bdg,Probably north of Waukegan
z6kjs0,,iyb4rb1,Suggest anything there if I'm around?
z6kjs0,iy92eam,,hey! I currently use a canvas tent with a stove but I'm considering switching back to a two-person tent of which I thrown oversized or California King blanket over the top of it and my body heat is enough to keep it considerably warm even in freezing weather. you should consider that. a two-person tent gives me just enough room for a bag pack myself laying down I'm six foot one, and my 88 key keyboard which is the same size as me laying down.  if you have a blanket that covers the whole thing and is thick enough or two blankets that cover the whole thing down to the ground you will be shocked as to how much heat your own body can produce in that enclosed insulated space.
z6kjs0,,iyb11ty,Awesome advice! I'll definitely do it next time I get a tent. This was temporary and gave it away to another homeless dude. Was just in that particular area for a bit. My typical setup is sleeping bag on the ground. Generally in Vegas so makes sense. Over a year and it's worked out fine thankfully.
z6kjs0,iyaxddc,,Hope you are doing well. Praying for you.
z6kjs0,iz32t7t,,‚ùÑÔ∏è oh wow u must be cold in there.... Some artic sleeping bags.. maybe a space heater and a pet dog can keep you warm
z6kjs0,,iz8c0pi,Appreciate you checking in. Thankfully I'm fine. I ordered a 0 degree rated mummy sleeping bag plus a heated vest powered via USB. Guess there's a perk to growing up poor in Oregon and thinking seeing your breath indoors during Winter was normal lol üòÇ
z6kjs0,iz32xay,,Get a fire arm . Or some sort of self defense weapons. Camping out like that can be dangerous.
z6kjs0,,iz8bp6z,I've got stuff to protect. I was a former athlete who wrestled for one of the best universities and was an amateur MMA champ.
z6kjs0,iy3vv9x,,Why are you in Illinois in the winter?
z6kjs0,,iyb4cn0,Supporting someone with terminal cancer who I coincidentally met through this group. They said I'm all they got so I came. They're an unbelievable person and I'll reveal more with time.

z6ib3j,iy1u9ax,,Life is full of ups and downs and I find that the ups outnumber the downs. Despite being homeless, despite the heartache, the cold, the sore joints, being ignored by "normal" people... I still can find wonder, pleasure, and love in my life. I am grateful for all the people I have met, the meals shared, the stories and jokes and the hugs and breaking down in tears.   For thousands of years, humans have inhabited this earth. We are living better than damn near all of them. I'm doing something right now I would have never dreamed possible in high school (and I'm not that old). Every day we learn, we improve, we get better. I am alive to see tomorrow, because despite it being hard today, and likely hard tomorrow, tomorrow will be better. The next day, even better. I want to live to see a better, more accepting, more sympathetic world, and every day we get closer to that.
z6ib3j,,iy78moo,Wow man, I‚Äôm just so blown away by your outlook in life. Thank you so much for sharing
z6ib3j,,iyb22oy,Thank you, that's very kind and exactly what I'm talking about! Your wonderful comment just brightened my day. I just made a connection, was validated by a stranger and at this moment I feel like I matter. That's huge, and really warms my heart! Thank you!!!

z6ib3j,iy25s5z,,Pure spite, I was not willing to lay down and die. Eventually though I realized I wanted to go to college and I ended up doing so.
z6ib3j,iy1mv8v,,Two things kept me going:  1) Not wanting to spend the rest of my life going to evangelical church services twice a day.  2) Wanting to show my family, who drove off and left me sitting among my possessions as I was being evicted, that I wasn't a loser just because I didn't get married and pop out a few kids.
z6ib3j,iy27yl5,,im still homeless but the fear of the pain from dying is the only thing keeping me around now  ive tried banging myself multiple times, contemplating jumping in front of a train and cutting my throat but i keep still pussying out even after drinking and smoking to numb myself from that fear. pain from taking my own life is just too terrifying for me, i hate that part about me
z6ib3j,,iy2iko4,But that's the part of you that's keeping you alive
z6ib3j,iyedjla,,Well I‚Äôm currently homeless. I think what keeps me alive is that if I die nobody would miss me. There isn‚Äôt anyone to notify. Or anyone to claim a body. I dream about living a life that I can be kind to people and impact them. Help them. That‚Äôs what I strive for every day.
z6ib3j,iy2068k,,Clash of Clans

z6ib3j,,iym68i0,I get ur concern but even if I saved all my money I still wouldn‚Äôt want to get an apartment because the rent alone will immediately take 2/3 my monthly income. There‚Äôs ppl living 1 paycheck away from homelessness, go give them financial advice

z6ib3j,iy2indc,,My kids.
z6ib3j,iy28rr6,,I'm partially homeless currently, so I still struggle with keeping going and pushing forwards until I can finally get a house and car, but what keep me going and what kept me going before is reminding myself that I'm not a quitter and I'm not weak, and if I kill myself now I'll die a nobody, a pathetic weak failure. It probably sounds ridiculous but that's my only fear, so I weaponize it to keep me going. Just do one thing at a time, and survive one day at a time, and hopefully someday it'll get better and I'll have the life I want and deserve.
z6ib3j,iy3sx6k,,I get to be dead forever. Why rush it? Also it's not that bad. A lot of it is perspective. I'm grateful for sme things.
z6ib3j,,iy46tg7,I heard this once : suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. When I feel suicidal I always remember this.
z6ib3j,iy7bvl9,,Not having a quick and easy way to do it.  If I had owned gun I would not be here right now. I was homeless with my mom and dog as well. My mom is disabled and part of that includes mental illness. When this happened I had to take over doing everything because it was all too much for her.  We did talk about it a few times. Taking all of our medicines and just all dying together. But I think the main thing that has stopped me from it up until now because I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for years even before this happened. Is that my fear of the unknown is still stronger then my suffering.
z6ib3j,iyi05wk,,For me it was the sheer will of wanting to be successful, I was not going to let anything stand in my way. I told myself that I would persevere no matter what that I would not stop I would not quit. No matter what life threw at me I would bounce back and bounce back stronger than ever  I was homeless for parts of junior high and High School which was very difficult trying to obtain an education under trying and difficult circumstances. When I turned 16 I said to myself I never want to be homeless again. I was angry and I used that to my advantage as my Shear will to push myself to better myself.

z6ib3j,iy2kkl0,,Not Formerly... yet.  Again.  So... not my first rodeo..  ***Homelessness isn't worth dying over***.  It might kill you... but crossing the street when you have a house or apartment can kill you.  Getting into your car on today's roads can kill you.  Not giving up the meth ~~can~~ will kill you.  Having a house, and a job, and an RV, and a vacation in the desert can kill you, just because you chose the vodka over the water every time.  Par-Tay!  WooHoo!  It might kill you... but it is NOT worth dying for.
z6ib3j,,iyc1mb8,I think homelessness is a fate worse than death. You don't feel pain when you die, but when you're homeless, there's a big deal of suffering coming your way, and for some people, it's not temporary.
z6ib3j,,iydfmzf,Maybe natural selection has a way of working things out then, and makes some modern people feel so strongly about what homelessness forces one to confront... that they have to end it.  Teenagers have committed suicide over bad grades, being rejected by their crush, etc.  They thought THOSE things were worse than death too.  Were they right?
z6ib3j,,iydkhc0,From hearing stories of many teenagers, and having been a teenager myself, I can assure you that bad grades and a breakup were only the last straw. Teenagers suffer from so many deep problems like social isolation, constant physical and verbal abuse by their pears, problems in the family, school pressure etc.
z6ib3j,,iyebhju,So you are saying that the life they were experiencing, \*was actually\* worse than death.  Sure... SOME teenagers have committed suicide because they were abused and lived a life of hell... and SOME teenagers committed suicide because they were bullied... and SOME teenagers committed suicide just because they got rejected.... and SOME teenagers committed suicide because of a combination of things.  Are you saying they were ALL right, when they thought their problems were worse than death?  Every one of them?  Even before their lives really started... they were right in ending them?  EDIT:  Let's save some back and forth.  No, they couldn't ALL be right in that their lives were \*actually\* worse than death.  Can you be ABSOLUTELY positive, that there aren't changes that could be made in a homeless person's life, that couldn't change their mind on their life being worse than death?  Are you ABSOLUTELY certain that there is NOTHING that could have been done to improve things?  100%?  Because if you aren't ABSOLUTELY 100% positive... then it CANNOT be worse than death.  Because death is 100% final.  There's no... "Oh Wait... you could have done THIS" to make things better once that line is crossed.  Here's another way of looking at this.  If there is nothing where you are, and you are homeless, and you feel that death is a better option.... you are LITERALLY saying that WALKING is worse than death.... that WALKING to a new place to see if things can be different, is worse than death.  Or rolling.  Or hobbling.  Or limping.  That doing any of those things is worse than being dead.
z6ib3j,,iygtmcg,Kids and teenagers have big dreams and hopes for the future to become free adults, they're very curious and hopeful by nature. If a child wants to commit suicide, then something very serious happened to him or her. Maybe not all teenagers commit suicide for the right reasons, but most of them do. I wish there was a way to save their lives, but unfortunately, the system is too rotten from its foundation to help them. In order to save their lives, you need more than a parent's hugs and kisses. You need substantial help, like protecting the child from bullies or help lower the pressure at school etc.  There are two types of homelessness, there's a temporary homelessness and permanent homelessness. The temporary type is experienced by young and able bodied people who are only experiencing a crisis, but as long as they're young and can work, they can lift themselves out of the situation, But permanent homelessness is a different story. It's usually experienced by physically or mentally disabled people who can't work and don't have family or anyone who can help them, so there's no much hope for them and there's a great deal of suffering coming their way. If the government can't or doesn't want to help them, then Why live in the streets in a disabled body or soul for decades until you die if you can end your  In the end of the day, it's a matter of respect. Only the person who suffers knows how much suffering they can endure and when enough is enough. Why prolong their agony?  Edit: Just to make it clear, walking is not worse than death, but lack of freedom, lack of safety, starving, getting robbed, beaten and raped daily, with little to no hope in sight, is worse than death.

z614mi,iy07xqc,,Honestly that looks like an ideal spot. Secluded enough to leave some stuff and set up a whole tent. My ares is too crowded I live on naps on public land. Never any privacy unless late at night when no one is out. I could get comfortable there

z5n083,ixy0prs,,[Use the maps](https://www.blm.gov/arizona).  Find the closest slice of BLM land.  You can park/camp hassle-free for up to two weeks at a time, before you technically have to move to another spot 25 miles from the first.  [Read through the comprehensive guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/wjvkjh/comprehensive_and_systematic_resource_guide_for/) we keep pinned at the top of the posts here.  Youll find more information that you can use... links to pretty much every resource at a federal level, and links to find resources at a local state and city level.  Just about every question we see here, can be answered by that guide.  Since cops can cover any ground you can cover, and more, staying off their radar means not looking like something that would attract their attention... or being parked somewhere that they won't think twice at you being there.  Walmart has a reputation for allowing RVs and Rigs to park overnight, and they sometimes overlook the fact that a car isn't an RV.  The first giveaway that Walmart won't allow overnight parking, would be the No Overnight Parking signs.  However, if your local Walmart does NOT have No Overnight Parking signs posted on many of the light poles in the light.... you can likely stay in the lot for a night or three in a row.  It is important to know that even "allowed" overnight Walmart parking is at the store manager's discretion.... and if they want to tell one person they can't park overnight while blatantly ignoring someone else doing the same exact thing.. they can and \*will\* do so.  You could pay to park in a parking garage.  There are a few around the city.  Chances are, there won't be a posted notice against sleeping in a vehicle... but you need to LOOK for those posted rules..  There might even be a legal loophole, where you could avoid paying a lot of money by "accidentally" losing the parking stub.  Say... you stayed in the garage for a few days... and when you went to leave, you didn't have your stub.  Their rules will likely say that you pay the maximum amount for the day.  That's alright, considering you would have been parked there for three days.  You \*CAN\* get a permit from the Department of Parks and Recreation to camp on land owned by the city of Phoenix.  In fact, if you camped on land without the permit, this is what you'd be charged with... not having one.  Should be cheaper than rent, and that means you can get a little elaborate with your camp setup.. and if cops came by, you'd just show them your legal permit.  And they go away.  You'd also be able to "camp" out of the car this way, instead of a tent... with the permit.  If you can get permission to park overnight on any private property, there is nothing the cops can do.  Maybe you can trade night "security" work for a place to park at a welding shop, or some other small industrial-like, or construction-based, business.
z5n083,ixxwo8t,,When I had a car I parked in Walmart parking lots, was never bothered. Home Depot, costco, big lots...any big box store is good but walmarts got the cheapest stuff and the most relaxed employees. Was able to use the Walmart bathroom. Also spent a couple months parked in a church parking lot with the permission of the church. Freeway rest stops are good, but often away from resources/cities.   Be sure to cover your windows in winter to keep your car warm. Use a window shade, cardboard or clothing. If cops or someone from the store comes knocking, give them no trouble, apologize a lot and move on.
z5n083,ixxynsx,,So far, I've felt more comfortable near the Eos gym locations in Glendale and Goodyear. Also, their parking lots are situated east/west. Glendale is way more active at night than Goodyear is. I also have a heavy duty sleeping bag. My biggest problem recently has been my car battery. I managed to get a jumper set that's i recharge off the battery while the cat is running and I've been recharging my phone off that also.
z5n083,,iy8oy9w,Then the next paycheck from that decent job, has to at least partially spent on a new battery.  Or you can fly a sign in what spare time you might have.  Or you can find a small auto parts store, put in an application, ask to speak to the manager, explain that you NEED a job in an auto parts store because you live out of your car... and be persistent every couple of days.  Worked for me in Falls Church, Virginia once.  That's how I managed to replace the cam shaft gear for the timing chain assembly on my 1977 Plymouth Fury at the time.  I found a small shop, and pretty much begged for a job to earn the part.  No... it wasn't back in the 70's either... 1990's.  I know... you can likely get a cheaper battery at Walmart... but that battery wouldn't come with a paycheck.  This could also be a way to get a clean-up job at a repair garage.  You need a battery (and maybe some repair work)... and a place to park.  You might be able to find a shop that would trade you a place to park and a battery, for light clean-up and night security.
z5n083,ixyf4gd,,If you can get out of Phoenix. I've never had anything but bad experiences from aggressively shitty people there. I will go to great lengths to avoid that place. Go down to Tuscon.
z5n083,,ixz91d3,What's keeping me here is a storage unit of my families things that I'm tryna send to Mexico (my wife is from MEX) otherwise I'd already be out, because I've had too many negative experiences with people in Maricopa Co., not just PHX.   I tried. I really tried. I moved here right when all the Californians did and saw the rent and property prices shoot straight up. IF I stay in AZ, it will only be because I get a dream home close to the most scenic part of the Grand Canyon. If not, when I leave, I'm never coming back to AZ. Which is sad. I had so many dreams for my family here.

z5n083,,ixz98qy,I would do Door dash, i have done DD, before i ever do ride shares again. Plus, I'm living out of me car...
z5n083,,iy687pk,I was going to suggest Instacart. You can make an easy $100-200 especially on the weekends where you can make $200-$300 on Sunday alone. Once your signed on you can shop anywhere in the country and I met an Airbnb host that way while in Miami living out of my car who charged me $25 pr day to rent a room in his house. I stayed for a month before heading back to my home state. Instacart will throw you money the first month in order to get you hooked but it's a way to make fast cash that you can cash out instantly.
z5n083,,iy76vhj,I will definitely check that out! Thank you! Probably a lot easier on the car than DD.
z5n083,,iy7xhij,Well, depending on the area you chose to shop in. If you're in a major city/metro area you will drive less but then there are stairs, valet attendants, conceirge, gate call boxes, and traffic to deal with.
z5n083,,iy8giu4,W DD, there's all that, plus a lot of driving.

z5n083,,ixz816z,I have an Eos membership, it was the first thing I did before becoming homeless. My main concern is being harassed while I'm tryna sleep. My employer didn't give me a paper check before the holiday and it still hasn't arrived in my POBox yet. That's the only thing I'm concerned about right now. I think i can make it another week until I get paid. I'm hoping the check is there before I go to work on Monday

z5n083,,iy06z7j,I have a storage unit, my main concern is my car and the storage units. I have a decent job but I'll probably get back into Door dash for extra money. This holiday weekend screwed me up on a paper check. I had direct deposit but i got levied for CS.   Like i said, i gotta a lot of issues that lead up to this.   I appreciate you reaching out though
z5n083,iy5z564,,Everywhere is hiring in Phx..I dont know how much you make but you should be able to find a job making 17-18/hr. You say you have bills.....time to pay what is mandatory and cut back where you can. You should be working full time at 1 job and you can even find part time at a second job......you should have enough to rent a room. Unless you have extremely high car payment...wage garnishments...high car insurance..expensive habits you shouldnt be in your car.
z5n083,,iy76r5h,Basic rent in Maricopa Co is 1500mo. That's half my pay. I also pay CS. Most jobs in Maricopa Co pay under 17hr.  So far, all the room shares I've found come w a disclaimer about being a parent w a teenage daughter. Or being a homosexual nudist. I don't need any of that drama, and the only other available options are halfway homes, and honestly, even if they would take me, i don't want to take that away from the people it's designed for.  I don't mean to come off harsh, i realize i left a lot out. I appreciate your time you've given me.  I literally go to work, go park outside the gym i have a membership to for the showers, go to the library, go to work. I live off Jack n the Box tacos. They ring me up as soon as I walk inside.  This is my life at the moment.  My biggest concern is the laws in AZ that are prohibitory towards homeless and transient persons. Regardless of employment. People who work from "home" in their RV have been arrested for transience because of some concerned Karen, and then they gotta get their RV out of the impound.  I don't think i could afford that at this time.  Again, thank you for your time.
z5n083,,iy8k1nk,Yes, I know how much it is. I live out here. I am lucky I own my home and I bought cheap nine years ago. Otherwise I would be struggling to and probably living with my mom. Since you can‚Äôt afford to rent your own place, a roommate is about the only viable option. Lots of people have to share housing. Your options are to move to a cheaper state but then you‚Äôd be leaving your kid or get shared housing or live in your car. You don‚Äôt have a lot of options.  Also, nobody wants homeless in their community. Some are straight out thieves that will steal anything not bolted down. Nobody wants RVs parked in their neighborhood. They don‚Äôt live there. So you can‚Äôt blame people for not wanting a bunch of homeless in their neighborhood. Many homeless people seem to do very very little to change their situation. There is a way out if you work hard enough. I hope things get better for you. Maybe with a little luck. You‚Äôll find a great roommate in a nice housing situation that works for you. Good luck .
z5kbvl,ixwvr5f,,A five dollar bill. Hear me out, having the option to go into a store and buy a drink or advil or shoelaces or whatever you need at the moment you need it is a huge comfort. Just having a bit of cash and the flexibility to use it as it may become necessary.  HUGE! Even if it's to pop into a McDonald's and get something off the dollar menu so you can get warm for a minute and use the bathroom.
z5kbvl,ixwkop5,,Is it weird that I‚Äôm strangely a little excited to see what the people give the homeless for Xmas? I got 5 plates of food for thanksgiving from 5 diff people haha
z5kbvl,,ixx8woz,I got 6. I couldn't believe it.  I'm not religious, and I wish people would stop imposing Christian hedgemony. One of the things I was given came with weird bible quotes about "being my g-d" and not being afraid of a single thing because some g-d supposedly exists. üôÑ

z5kbvl,,ixwsdxt,Thank you very much, that helps a lot!
z5kbvl,,ixwsth1,Of course! Thought of one more. Small ground tarps that fit in small stuff sacks. I think they sell them at Walmart in the camping aisle & they‚Äôre pretty cheap. Makes a world of difference not sleeping directly on dirt or dirty surfaces.
z5kbvl,,ixyc79i,1. solar light ($1) very useful for homeless plus they work as tent nail/holder/ I forgot what they're called.  2. Hand warmers, boy o boy those are life saving in the damn cold, keep my extremities from freezing off.  3. Vienna sausage cans, gimme 2 no gimme 4, them cans are nice soup to keep warm, plus the sausage are very fillings.  4. $1 table cloth, work excellent as either a mat for waterproofing or as an impromptu tarp.   5. banana and water bottle ofc.
z5kbvl,ixwt7f6,,The toothbrushes given at the shelters here are so cheap they fall apart as you use them. When I was homeless all I wanted was a descent soft toothbrush. Hand sanitizer, Tylenol or aspirin, socks, tums.
z5kbvl,ixx0su8,,It all depends on where you want to distribute those bags. If you are wanting to give them to a shelter or pass them out to those who are outside. The need will be slightly different. You are off to a good start though. But here are some ideas. But you can also contact your outreach programs to see if they can help you get more people involved.  * Non-perishable foods. (Nothing that has to be cooked. Not everyone has access to be able to cook them or the ability to open them.) * Socks * Hand and foot warmers. * Gloves * Deodorant * Sewing kit * Flashlight * Manicure set * Shoelaces * Tylenol, Aleve, Advil...etc. * Women products. * Toothbrush/Toothpaste * Comb/Brush * Bottle of water
z5kbvl,,ixxpnrm,Do you have specific examples of non-perishables that you could share? We put together packs at work and always make sure to go with pop-top cans, but sometimes it doesn't feel like what we're giving out is doing sufficient good. For a while, we had MREs and those were a hit, but we have been out for a while and they are costly. What types of items are palatable even if they can't be warmed?
z5kbvl,,ixy8dd8,Anything that you have to keep in the fridge and can't be stored at room temperature. No fruit if these bags are going to sit waiting for someone who needs it. For example. I work in a shelter. Our snack bags we hand out to the public come in big boxes and some of those bags can sit up to 2 weeks or more at the bottom of the large boxes. The fruit will rot. But fruit cups are great!  pop tops can are perfect, but not everyone will have a source to cook them. Some stores will allow one to come and use their microwave, but not many. We take anything out that has to be cooked and put it in the snack room for our clients or in the emergency food storage. Our snack bags are made & donated by our community. We don't make them ourselves. Same with the hygiene bags we hand out.  I can tell you the bags we received to hand out with things like MREs, and canned meats that don't require cooking or to be refrigerated were a hit. So were the tuna snack packs. Espaclay the ones that came with the meat and crackers. Also, the cheese and cracker snack packs.  Pastries I'd stay clear from unless you know the bags will be eating within a day or two. But the ones that are individually wrapped and will last a while are great.
z5kbvl,ixwx702,,Canned food not usually a good idea as many homeless have no way to open it up. Socks gloves deoordorant toothbrushes and toothpaste notebooks and penxils

z5kbvl,ixxtj49,,toilet paper, baby wipes, toothbrush/paste, etc, Make sure canned food can be opened. our group stopped giving out foods that needed to be heated, because sometimes homeless folks are careless with their fires. there are some individuals who will give that to some homeless they trust, but our organization doesnt.
z5kbvl,ixydzpx,,Throw in a cheap lighter, or a bic if you're feeling generous, or even just a box of matches in a plastic bag. I'm not saying give people cigarettes, but for the smokers it'll be greatly appreciated, for those that don't, they may still be able to have some use for it. Especially if your area has a lot of natural landscape where people camp, a fire source can be a life saver during the cold months.
z5kbvl,ixz83ym,,I was on my way to a big Christmas thing at municipal auditorium in Nashville a couple years ago and me and a friend who goes by "Robin hood" got stopped. our stocking(just walking up 1st Ave N) had hygiene, socks, Beanie weenies, and a pint of Canadian Last Two Dollars!

z5kbvl,iy4fiyi,,Feminine products, small lotions, hand sanitizer, socks, gloves, beanies, those inexpensive mylar blankets, snacks that don't have to be refrigerated or cooked. Canned good gets heavy and people have to carry their stuff everywhere. Small snacks like peanut Butter crackers, small slim Jim's were always a hit where I volunteered. Also a sandwich was always welcomed.  If you can, lighters would be a huge plus. They are sold in bulk cheap on Amazon. Small pack of baby wipes, toiletries like small shampoos, soaps, deodorant. Bandaids and pain reliever.    Condoms. This one was a popular request.
z5eo69,ixwwny6,,Also scarves are SUPER underrated, I had no idea how massive a difference a scarf makes so I recommend anyone cold get one

z5eo69,ixwgmoy,,you're not afraid all that reflective material in a tent in the forest might attract an alien probe?
z5eo69,,ixwlub3,Are you speaking from experience?
z5eo69,iy96tso,,I like your collection of tips and wanted to add one. I can't believe how warm this kept me and it seemed to almost not matter how cold it was outside so long as the insulation was 100% coverage. but take it two person tent something with like a four by seven foot bass or smaller and cover it completely with oversized (120x120) blanket you can also use two queen or king size blankets overlapping so long as the entire top of it is covered entirely and then you can put a tarp on that or you don't really have to if you're like me and you're in the desert.  right now anyway I'm using the canvas tent with the stove and it doesn't keep me as warm as my body heat in a small tent did. of course I can always overload my stove but gathering wood and cleaning the stove stocking it up it all takes effort
z5eo69,ixwwpt9,,I wonder if you duck tapped them to the inside of the tent if it would keep body heat in the tent better.
z5eo69,,ixwxyiy,Very likely, but it would take longer the heat up the tent w just body heat, unless it's a very small tent.
z5eo69,,ixwz3hv,Tea light and clay pot heaters would help and the blankets being lined inside the tent would help keep the heat in. That way you wouldn‚Äôt have to do the under the blankets shiver all day.
z5eo69,,ixxe1cf,Yes, the stuff would work as a thermal barrier on the inside of a tent... or on the outside of the tent.  If you put it on the outside, it would just be in your best interests to put another fabric over it.  Again... those blankets don't stand up to weather and abuse.  Anywhere you want to block the transmission of heat... wrapped around you like a blanket, on the shelter that is around you, etc.  That's what it does.  You don't have to be looking at the reflective nature, for it to be blocking heat from going past it.  The tea light and clay pot would be a good way to introduce heat relatively safely... and the tent covered in thermally reflective material would keep the inside warm... or make it harder for the heat to escape at any rate.  They don't put this stuff on the outside of spacecraft and satellites for nothing.
z5eo69,,ixy0cvq,Something else that can be used is aluminum tape. Get an old army wool blanket, tape one side and then sew a cover over that. Also, if you fasten three shelter halves together, and use the tape on the insides of that, for winter, and for summer you could reverse the halves.
z5eo69,,ixy1atq,The downside I can see there, is the expense of the aluminum tape, as opposed to the cost of the emergency thermal blanket.  $10-ish a roll, versus $3 for the blanket.  Of course coverage is the real key... if the roll covers three times the area of the thermal blanket, then the cost is spot on.  But yes... foil does what foil does... whether it is tape, tin, or plastic.  It will all block radiative transmissions well and keep heat in.
z5eo69,,ixz9ur4,There's also the durability, malleability and stiffness of the tape. Quilting this together will increase longevity.
z5eo69,,ixzcwi0,My father worked for an Industrial Insulation company.... he was a field supervisor.  He'd worked jobs installing insulation at a Coca Cola bottling plant, and a Frito Lay plant... tons of oil/fuel depots.. you name it.  The company did such big jobs, they would have insultation made for their jobs.  Their warehouse had pallets of boxes full of those big, rough glass marbles they make fiberglass out of.  He used to bring some home... cuz kids like marbles.  That, and I spent many a Saturday afternoon playing in the warehouse while he caught up on the week's paperwork.  He brought home tons of "work stuff".... rolls and rolls of actual duct tape (this was the 70's and 80's).... rolls of aluminum tape, rolls of fiberglass tape, boxes of those wooden stakes they use for spacers... that black, hard, glass insulation that you can use to strip paint from metal (that stinks as you use it)... and I can't even begin to imagine how many Bostitch staplers passed through our garage.  In my experience growing up and playing with the stuff... I can't really agree that it is more durable.  The adhesive itself doesn't last as long as duct tape, because it is attached to aluminum foil as opposed to being attached to a combination of fabric and plastic.  The tape itself should only be used on firm surfaces... like actual ducting, or the sheet metal covering that is put OVER an insulated conduit.  When taping soft, paper covered insultation... or flexible black foam insulation... my father always used either the duct or fiberglass tapes.  And... that's also partly  why I suggested quilting the thermal blanket between two blankets.  I mean... the same reason as your suggestion to quilt the tape between blankets to increase the durability of the construct.
z5eo69,,ixy004z,For the clay pot heaters, I suggest getting a small glass oil lamp with a wick, keep the wick small. Use olive oil, it works great and you can use it for a ton of other things. Olive oil is an acid, so you can use SMALL amounts for your hair and skin as well. SMALL amounts. Also, i use a terracotta plate as the base for my clay heater. You're gonna have some smoke.    If you find some high heat resistant filter material, you can place that between the two clay pots. Leave the drain hole open in the inside pot, and plug the drain hole of the outside pot. The smoke will be forced through the filter material and should mitigate it's affects, but you still need to keep a source of fresh air available.
z5eo69,,ixxem4i,I wouldn't use Duck brand Duct tape though.
z5eo69,,ixxixqt,No maybe something that can take weather. Like gorilla tape.
z5eo69,iy3tap4,,I‚Äôll piggyback this and say screw sewing it in. You can just layer it in between blankets. When I was sleeping in my car last winter in 0 degree whether I put one under my sleeping blankets and one layered on top and I was extremely warm tbh
z5eo69,,iy41hfr,>Why sew it all together?  To keep shit from bunching up when you sleep.  That's why I thought sewing it together would be a good idea.  That, and it doesn't get bunched up eventually and start to tear, or shoved into the corner of a tent, etc.  It becomes a part of that blanket or covering.  You don't have to arrange your layers when you get ready to sleep... you just pull it around you like the single custom-made comforter that it is.
z5eo69,,iy42j2i,Yes I understood what was said the first time. I disagree it‚Äôs necessary if you are living in your car. I did quite fine without sewing it in. That‚Äôs a lot of time and effort and unless you are good with sewing it‚Äôs as likely as not to just rip anyway.  I really like my method, the coldest it got down to was 0 when I did it and we were quite comfortable almost too warm at points in that snowy miserable night. Fortunately I missed the deep deep winter with -25 etc because that would have been really tough.
z5eo69,,iy5ytq6,I don't believe I actually ever said it would be necessary to make something like this if you were living in a car.  I'm pretty sure that what I said was...  >here's a way to stay warmer, longer, when "exposed" to the elements living in a tent, or even on the street.  So... *I am not sure exactly who you are disagreeing with*... in your opinion that this would be necessary if one lived in a car.  It isn't me.  Don't Straw-man this and put words in my mouth just so you can disagree with them.
z5eo69,ixy2r30,,They're intended to be temporary or one time use, they can tear fairly easily. They won't last long if you sew it.
z5eo69,,ixza9ce,I'm pretty sure you missed the point... and didn't read the post.  Here are some relevant highlights.  >The point is... you put the thermal blanket between two other fabrics. This will make the whole thing last longer... MUCH longer.  That was the **first** time I addressed how, alone, those emergency thermal blankets don't last very long.    >The material itself doesn't stand up to direct abuse... thus, the thermal blanket sandwich.  That was the second time I addressed that these things aren't made to last.  So... you \*do\* realize that you are telling me something that I clearly was aware of already when I made this post... since I came up with a descriptive way of making them last longer, by sandwiching them between two other materials.  Again.. **the whole point** of the post was that those things aren't durable, and need to be used in conjunction with other things to make them last longer.  But thank you for reminding me of how they aren't durable.  Someone should come up with a way of getting better use out of them, so they do their job for longer.  Someone should come up with an idea for how to use those Emergency Thermal Blankets in such a manner that their fragility can be largely ignored.    Oh wait... I already DID that in this post.  ...hmm.  Were you saying that since they are considered disposable, no attempt should be made to use them in a way that makes them less disposable?
z5eo69,ixzdqea,,They make tarps with a reflective side that is extremely durable
z5eo69,,iy18q9n,How much do they go for?  I ask, because some organizations give out these emergency thermal blankets like candy.
z4wz7t,iy81qkz,,Hey there, I also struggle with mental illness. I have PTSD and major depressive disorder among quite a bit of other things. I was recently homeless, and I know how dark that things can get especially while mentally ill. I just want you to know that no matter what you will be okay!! The dark feeling of not being able to make it out there is just your brains way of trying to defend itself. I promise you that it will be okay, even though it feels absolutely terrifying, traumatic, and scary. There are many people who would be willing to help you even without asking for anything in return. And when people feel the need to survive, it's often achieved. You will be okay, no matter what happens. I promise!! :)
z4l3zd,ixs291g,,This is exactly why I say that homelessness isn't supposed to ever be \*comfortable\*.  People lose their connection with motivation once they hit that comfort stage.  Like... when you finally sit in a nice couch after walking or standing all day, and as you settle in... something happens where you have to get up (the couch can be anywhere... indoors or out).  You know the feeling... it's like... "Jeeze.. I just got comfy!"  All that motivation to stand or walk vanished the second your ass hit the cushion.. and then suddenly you are scrambling to find it.  It doesn't mean you can't learn to be both.  But let's face it... you get comfy on that couch to get some work done (or watch TV, or the scenery), and there's a good chance you'll fall asleep in the middle of it.  Even comfy office chairs don't really compare to kickin' back on a couch.  When comfort comes in and motivation goes out, this generally means one doesn't \*want\* what they were previously motivated to do/get.  Typically this offers two choices.  Either one has to \*force\* oneself into new habits (that stereotypical parent who works crap jobs to support their family, the people who work in waste management in the field, etc.) or one has to re-evaluate whether or not they need what they were previously motivated to do/get.  A concrete example?  Either find a way to earn money, or find a way to live without money.  Your goal was survival for a while.  Now.... life seems tame.  This life you were working on building isn't easier... if it were, you wouldn't have been homeless in the first place.  So... manufacturing the motivation to do what you need to in order to stay employed and homed isn't going to be easy... but that is what you have to do, if you want to keep a job and a home.  Just because the place you are in now isn't right, doesn't mean being homed isn't right.  I know that's not what you are saying, but since you already have a safety net of sorts... you know how to make homelessness work for you... the idea of going back to homelessness doesn't seem nearly as bad.  And that... sounds just like Institutionalization.  You know.... where people get so comfortable with prison life, they can't function outside of prison and they either voluntarily or involuntarily commit crimes to get sent back.  Actually, Institutionalization means...  >the action of establishing something as a convention or norm in an organization or culture  Where you should be telling yourself that there's no way you'd go back to being homeless, you instead find yourself acknowledging that being homeless wasn't that bad.  It was, and is, and you \*should\* be avoiding it.  So... maybe try setting small daily goals.  Maybe spend more time out than in, looking for a second job, or doing recon to find a better room to rent.  Can't fix the flat?  Get back to walking.  I get it.  It is hard.  You live in a filthy place, you are broke and have bills and obligations, keeping clean every day is a chore... too many responsibilities and schedules and obligations.  Again.. I know it is all hard.  Doesn't that mean it is worth doing?
z4l3zd,,ixs8xrd,This is very well said. I completely agree. Being in survival mode is highly stimulating, you always have a sense of purpose and direction, whether it's "find food," "find shelter," etc. When you have a home, you get to the next level of existence, where suddenly you have to create your own purpose. It's a complete 180 shift from pure survival & adrenaline. It's HARD.   OP, maybe you need a change of location, it does sound like this environment is not the best. But be careful of telling yourself that things were better before. Being homeless causes trauma to your nervous system and it's just not the healthiest way to live. It's somewhat addictive in the way that it keeps you stuck in a repetitive cycle. The future can look different if you want it to. I wish you the best!
z4l3zd,,ixt274d,A change is as good as a rest.
z4l3zd,,ixtz9zo,A Wink is as good as a Nod to a Blind Horse.
z4l3zd,,ixuqjlq,I haven't looked at things this way before but you're right, thankyou for the insight
z4l3zd,,ixxcgdi,>Being homeless causes trauma to your nervous system  What do you mean by this?
z4l3zd,,ixxp2z5,I worded that badly, but basically I meant that being homeless can be traumatizing, and long term trauma & PTSD are very damaging to your nervous system. It's well documented that trauma physically changes your body chemistry, and creates health problems both mentally and physically.
z4l3zd,,ixt4mcw,Listen to this man. I disagree with him sometimes, but he has the common sense and life experience needed to offer great advice. And he's pretty much always spot on.
z4l3zd,,ixuqgz2,Very insightful! Thankyou for this
z4l3zd,ixrfmhg,,Do you struggle with "freeze response" or burn out? The same fucking thing happens to me.  Its like i have to be in mortal danger to have motivation for anything. The only reason i want a home for myself is so i can be somewhere quiet and warm. But if can find that homeless, idgaf if i am homeless.  I have almost froze to death before getting up and moving around because i just feel too settled.
z4l3zd,,ixv9ch8,Just a little scary tidbit... hypothermia actually causes the individual who is freezing to death to get more "comfortable" as their limbs start to get numb and they stop feeling the cold.  The process of freezing to death, by all post-mortem accounts (and those who came close) is **insidious**.  The closer you get to death, the better you feel, and your body is to blame because it is attempting to maintain heat at the core... at the expense of your limbs.  So yeah... literally... the loss of motivation to comfort can kill you in the cold.
z4l3zd,ixt4i2m,,It sounds like you may be depressed and, given your circumstance, that's understandable. But it also sounds like you need to grow up. If all you want is sex, consider this: The longer you go on like this, the less desirable any woman is going to find you. Same for most employers, although you seem less concerned about them. Call your county mental health services. Find a counselor. Get back on your psych meds. Go to rehab if you need to. Get your bike fixed. I bet that costs less than what you spend on cigarettes in a day.  You've got to want to fix the situation. So what are you going to do?
z4l3zd,,ixt6qgu,That‚Äôs what I was thinking. There may be some depression.
z4l3zd,,ixv2y1r,I don't think a person with so varied activities would get a depression diagnosis. And anti-depressants are probably the most failed drug category anyway. But I do get the vibe that OP should be in a recovery environment instead of fending for themselves with whatever inadequate means are available . It's also true there's hardly any recovery environments when you need them. I'm afraid it's a very common theme and the prognosis is no good at all. I'd move to a monastery, drink only water and tea, and avoid all medication.
z4l3zd,,ixvdtrx,I dunno.  I'm pretty much there... just without the actual monks... and I can't really recommend the option.  The OP likely had a much different picture in mind for when they finally got another roof over their head.  They advanced a step, and instead of finding solid footing, they found "new", different problems to solve.  They likely aren't thinking of how... back when they were first homeless... it was almost exactly the same, with the difference being in available choice.  It wasn't... do I go homeless, or do I pay rent... back then, it was likely "Oh Shit.. I'm homeless... wtf do I do?"  They had all the same kinds of problems... eating, shelter, clothing, socialization, how to fill needs, etc.  The problems are just presented now in different ways.  Back then, there wasn't a choice.  It was find food or go hungry.... find shelter or get wet.... etc.  Now... the OP perceives a choice... because he already has the homeless thing figured out.  I can respect that.  I personally took that in a different direction.... but I know what it is like to have gotten comfortable on that ledge.  Not Edge like being at the edge of a cliff... already being over the cliff, and on a ledge below.  The climb back up is difficult, and the footing is never solid.... and having gotten comfortable on the ledge makes the memory of the climb up just \*that\* far a little duller.  Rehab of some sort?  Not even drug rehab... social rehab... economic rehab.... rehabilitation itself is the act of restoring something to a former condition in a positive manner and direction.  A recovery environment, yes.  A place where one can be firmly, but gently eased back into the social conventions necessary to function in a homed and social environment... since at the very least, this is where the OP seems to want to be.  We just seem to only really have this for substance abuse and physical trauma therapies.    Some shelters try to rehab their "clients".  There was a shelter I stayed at, in Jacksonville NC.  Everyone had to shower before turning in.  Everyone had to look for work during the day (except Sunday), and turn in a sheet with locations and manager's numbers for the three places they applied to around town.  No sheet, no shelter for the night.  Going back to a place where one applied before to remind them was considered valid, as long as it wasn't daily.  The shelter also served as a soup kitchen during the day.  When the "clients" of the shelter came in at 7, any who wanted to eat were allowed to use the kitchen to make food, under the condition that everyone who wanted to eat contribute to the prep and cooking, and everyone who eats participated in the cleanup.  Everyone who stayed there was also given a chore in regards to the cleaning of the shelter.  Some swept, some mopped, some wiped, some brushed, some emptied trash, some replaced liners, etc.  It was all rehab.... all social rehab for relearning the habits one would need getting off the street and back into housing.
z4l3zd,,iy38bvj,youre a fairly skilled writer my friend...very interesting and enjoyable to read.   just saying...youre obviously a man with some stories to tell...id subscribe üòä
z4l3zd,,iy4aat4,I usually only spin stories into a comment or post, when I want to make a relevant point from the examples pulled from said stories.  \****Usually***\*.  I have a blog I haven't touched for years... turned out, I used it as a kind of therapy to work through some things.  When I figured that out, I just wrote a book instead.  Not a good one... I tear myself up pretty heavily in it.  What I've learned is more important than how I learned it in most cases.  See... now I'm thinking about this in a slightly new way.  As in.. this just popped into my head while I was rolling a smoke.  I've never lived in a place of my own, where I was comfortable entertaining visitors.  I have the blog... but I don't keep it up or advertise the address... probably for the same reason.  I did the website thing back in the day.... a few times... but I wouldn't tell people or put the link to it out there for others to find.  I compose music that I don't intend others to listen to.  I've never handled praise well... and I already have more rejection in my life than I can deal with  (IE... homeless and jobless).  So I do these things... write, compose, play, etc... for myself first and foremost.  This... what you are reading, here and now... is one of the very few ways that I interact with the world these days.  I have information that can be useful, a mind that can spin essays on the fly, lots of practice hitting these keys, a need to ***be*** social in some respect... and a desire to help solve a problem that affects more than just myself.  Here's some past.  I've never forgotten 10th Grade English class... Coventry High School, RI.  My writing was used to shame the rest of the class into writing better.  Seriously.  We all had to write an example of an intro paragraph.  I did one about Sting... since at the time I wanted to be a bassist just like him.  It began... "Visualize, there on the stage, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed man bunny hopping with a bass guitar to a frenetic rhythm."  I did my Triangle thing, I went on for a few sentences about the player and the basic description of his career before ending with the reveal that it was Sting.  Maybe ten, twelve sentences.  The very next day after we handed them in, she passes out a ditto with five paragraphs on it.  Mine, taking up almost half the page, and four other three sentence paragraphs.  She tells us all to pick the best one.  Now, the five of us who provided the examples, knew what was going on immediately... since we recognized our own work.  The other 25 in the class didn't.  Well.... no.  Kyle and Rick knew how I wrote from the AD&D gaming we did... and from my poster selection on my bedroom walls.  When she explained that these were examples from what we did as a class for the assignment, she said they all liked the paragraph written "by HIM!"... and there was a fucking scowl on her face and an angry finger pointing in my direction at the end... it wasn't to say "Hey, look at the good job he did."  She had weaponized my work, to embarrass the the rest.  She was pissed that \*I\* had provided her with the best writing from the group.  I never tied my high-tops.  I wore crappy clothes.  I was "husky".  I goofed off (the work was easy for me).  I didn't do homework, because I "got it".  My test scores proved it, and my teachers generally hated it.  Mr. Osterman figured me out though... 9th grade Algebra 2.  As long as I never got lower than a B, he let me do what I wanted in his class.  I made pipe cleaner "bugs" of different people.  He kept that little "Mr. Osterbug" for years.  Obviously this has stuck with me.  I did something right, and I did it well... and it was used to make others feel bad.  There as a course correction there I didn't notice for decades.... and that course correction affected everything in that intervening time.  TMI?  My posting history will show this to be par for the course.  Maybe I'll be able to turn this... talent... into something different someday.  Right now, this is how it is manifesting.  One, personal and public, comment at a time.  EDIT:  Thank you for those kind words, by the way.
z4l3zd,,j1uwp3h,Youre absolutely welcome for the kind words...in my experience, there is a shortage of kindness today...and it really doesn't take much to *be kind*.  I, like you, have always had natural aptitude where others seemed to struggle...*getting it* in a class of people who really *didn't get it* was one more reason for them to dislike me..  I've been homeless, had countless struggles, and will  expectedly have many more -  but that's because people like us are usually THE EXAMPLE for everyone else to learn from. whether it's good or bad.  you are an impressive person from what I've read so far...I started following you, so please keep up with your writing and posts on reddit. please! üòÑ
z4l3zd,,ixveoej,Agreed.
z4l3zd,ixrhve2,,This is something people don‚Äôt get for some homeless. I like my car, I can keep it clean and have some control or say over the environment I live in etc.  I‚Äôve had people who live in a mess or a disgusting house offer a room to me or along those lines and it‚Äôs not something I wanted or was more comfortable with!   Also the one time a friend let me in my body got way to relaxed after being struggling and fighting to eat, work survive etc and especially with all the excessive covid restrictions and me being unvaxxed. My body got some heat and comfort and a lot of the motivation left at least early on, my body was too fixated on not living in hell for once and I wasn‚Äôt getting enough done to get out of homelessness altogether (since I can‚Äôt stay at his place forever) so I left
z4l3zd,ixrtppl,,I was staying somewhere temporarily in 2020 and it was a nightmare. The people who lived there didn't clean ONCE in FIVE YEARS! There was a pile of 5 years worth of trash on the front patio and another in the kitchen. I kept paying a cleaning lady to come over, and my ex who used to be a professional cleaner before I met him and a professional cook helped with the cleanup and did the cooking because there was no way in hell I could cook in there. Btw, none of the cooking appliances worked, so he paid for a tabletop stove. It was a nightmare. I was hardly bathing too because I was so disgusted by the nature of the bathrooms. Every time I tried to leave to go back to living in a tent, the ex would stop me. The leaseholder was a drug addict and would also bring buddies to drink during the fucking pandemic. It was completely unlivable and I ended up losing one of my jobs over the sleep disruption. I would rather be homeless than in that hellhole.
z4l3zd,ixrv3a9,,I understand how u feel.
z4l3zd,ixsmgce,,Not every house is a home.  Good luck. I think you'll be better off, and I hope you find something that better suits your needs and wants so you can be more content.
z4l3zd,ixu2np8,,You can fix a flat tire with a piece of duct tape a bucket of water and an air pump
z4l3zd,,ixuk7uy,Dude I wholeheartedly do not and will not believe that
z4l3zd,,ixvea8k,The bucket of water is to find leaks.  The duct tape has to be good duct tape.  It isn't as GOOD as a patch and rubber cement... but think about it... that patch is just more rubber OR tough material, and the rubber cement is glue.  That's duct tape too.... or rather... good duct tape.  Not Duck Tape`tm`.
z4l3zd,,ixvmzeu,It'll definitely do in a pinch. Might not last as long. But I bet you could walk into a bike shop and ask if they can spare a tire patch and they'd be willing to help no problem.
z4l3zd,,ixvnnxi,Definitely won't last as long.  Pinch is good.  And Pinch gets you to that bike store to ask about a free patch... especially when the flat makes you immobile because you don't want to walk to that bike store.
z4l3zd,ixun9xd,,Sounds like you need an art or craft to focus on, be it painting, music, writing, coding, studying for a degree, carving, or whatever.  Yeah if smoking weed and playing video games in a messy household is all you end up doing while housed well I can see why it would seem redundant.  Living on the streets is an endless adventure.  The main thing keeping me from going back to the streets is I have been working on a writing career and homeless I could lose my laptop and not be able to continue to build on that.  However my experiences homeless have absolutely inspired my writing career.  I respect career vagabonds, and maybe one day I will go back to that life at least for a year or so.  It's just a matter of what you want to do.
z4l3zd,ixvcxzx,, Also take a couple hours and clean the house or just your area you can wash bedding sheets in shower as well. Cleaning can be form of therapy and will give you a task to complete so your mind will focus on that. Maybe only play video games at night, are you able to physically work anywhere even temp?
z4l3zd,ixsq705,,I love being homeless
z4l3zd,,ixsxom3,Why? The freedom?
z4l3zd,,ixwblfy,I do not like you in the street
z4l3zd,,iy1ed6a,I'm having a pretty good time of it too.
z4l3zd,ixvcgi3,, Is is possible to cut back on weed and booze for least a couple days and clear out your mind from the fog? Sometimes just shaking off the dull of comfort hell even walking outside when its cold for a bit really helps.    Try small like a walk around, then self care, shower / wash hair / shave or trim if you do. Far as laundry if you do not have a machine you have a shower / tub. All you need is some detergent or shampoo & soap GO EASY on the suds, fill tub let clothes sit for a while, rise the hell out of them and hang up. Under ware, t-shirts, cotton shirts dry and wash with ease pants and jeans take a bit longer use a chair back or drape over shower rod or just hand were air can get them.  You bike must need a tube? Easy fix Wal-mart has repair kits cheap.    Poster are right you should physically get out of house for a bit, IDK about leaving with winter setting in could you possible wait till end of Jan?
z4l3zd,iy3wd6w,,It can be extremely hard and practically impossible to break out of the depression mindset of nothing matters: I know when I go off my meds it‚Äôs no bueno (bipolar, adhd, chronic depression) but I also am going to call you out.   You CAN continue to take your psych meds. Empty the bag and sort the pills by matching color and numbers. Then just google what each pile is and put them back in the appropriate container with a ziplock and you will be fine.  I too have made many a lame excuse for not taking my meds but that‚Äôs weak my friend üòÇ
z4jgs5,ixsy7bu,,That looks like San Francisco
z4jgs5,ixsttoa,,I live on the water. Quite a few times I was tempted to swim out and stay on what I knew was usually empty boats. I can't swim very well and kept spending my money on booze before I could save enough to buy a life jacket to get to the boat.

z4jgs5,ixtrzgt,,I‚Äôm curious how do homeless people charge their phone? Sorry if it‚Äôs a dumb question it‚Äôs just something I always wondered from months since I joined this thread
z4jgs5,,ixu4m5f,Exactly like you would if you were airdropped in the middle of a random city or country you've never visited before: by scouting for everything and anything that looks like an available socket. If you have a homeless friend you're in luck, because you can first plug in their charger and if it doesn't explode then plug yours!
z4jgs5,ixrpxbl,,Gorgeous view. I get the beach every morning but no mountains

z3zs9u,ixom55u,,I'm grateful that for the first time in two years, I'm having Thanksgiving in my own place. I was in a shelter in 2020, unemployed and feeling like life would never get better. In 2021, I was sleeping on my cousin's couch, employed but having a hard time finding someplace that would rent to me because I had been evicted. Two weeks later I found a place and moved in. I'm rebuilding slowly with the help of a newly adopted cat and a great counselor. It'll take a while, but I'm headed in the right direction.  Hope you're all warm, safe and fed tonight.
z3zs9u,ixow2y9,,Very thankful for this community. This is a place where I can speak and listen, where I can ask for help and maybe help someone by sharing my past mistakes and wins. It may be cold, I may be alone, but as long as I've got this warm little light in my tent, I am part of something bigger than me.   Lots of love from the West Coast!
z3zs9u,ixqi1m0,,Thankful for strangers kindness
z3zs9u,ixsc67q,,Stayed at a shelter yesterday in Franklin KY. Being completely honest if it wasn't for these people and this community drop in center I'd be hungry and without a warm place to sleep tonight or the last five. I'm super thankful and humble at the same time. The are helping me get a job Monday and giving transportation to and from. Hope everyone stays safe this coming holiday season and keep your head up it's gets better

z3u8wm,ixol1m4,,Wish I had cheap substance to help me by. I‚Äôve worked 2-6 days all this summer on average and yet there were weeks altogether I couldn‚Äôt even buy a single beer.   Canada‚Äôs stupid expensive. And my province is one of the more expensive places.  24 is 50-60+  An 8 pack is 14-20$  Individual king cans are 3.30-5$  Tall boys are 2.80-5$  And a couple beers wears off really quick  So even though they‚Äôve made weed stupid expensive up here to, it lasts longer and is the cheaper option.  But even here pre rolls are  like 7-22$ a gram at the dispensaries and Bud itself isn‚Äôt much cheaper unless you want to buy the worst weed or buy mid level stuff in giant bulk like Half Oz there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt even many good deals, mostly just at Oz.
z3u8wm,,ixp0qno,When I was outdoors I'd get a handle of the cheapest vodka they had at the pharmacy (1.75oz vodka) to make mixed drinks at the end of the day to cope with the cold (amongst many other things) I don't want to sound like an enabler but I understand the desire for a release from the mental bullshit out there. Stay strong, and good on you for holding a job, you'll get out of this ü§òüèª
z3u8wm,,ixp1rg5,Funny enough I can‚Äôt even buy hard liquor. Like anywhere  In socialist Canada everything is done through the government so beer and weed can only be bought at their stores(with weed the stores are independently owned and just regulated etc but for beer and liquor it‚Äôs either the provincial liquor commission or the beer stores(which are legally only connected to hotels?)  So you can only get liquor at liquor commissions in Canada. Well Winnipeg is also a complete shit hole and has a higher crime index than all but 10-15 cities in the states, and is the worst city in Canada so a while back people were going into the liquor commissions(LC‚Äôs for short) and just taking bottles and loading up backpacks and walking out and some would even attack workers and smash bottles on the ground. So as a preventative measure they created a second locked entry door and you give up your license or Id well in the store. And they are stingy as hell. Since my car broke down and don‚Äôt drive these days I never got a new license photo taken. There‚Äôs no point as I‚Äôd be paying 10 or 20 for a picture that the second I move into a place and get an address, I will have to pay 10 or 20 and have it Done again. But now my photo Id is expired and the blue temp license has no photo so despite them knowing it‚Äôs me and having the ID of me, I‚Äôm not allowed in. So I actually can‚Äôt even buy liquor at all nationwide. There‚Äôs no way for me to even buy hard liquor only beer which is so overpriced in Canada (and even more so in manitoba) that it‚Äôs not worth it  I know this because during summer I wanted whiskey. But not allowed since I‚Äôm homeless and my license is expired üòÇü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è this fucking country And because people occasionally go and ask for their empty wine boxes for moving or whatever. They wouldn‚Äôt even look for empty boxes for me because I was denied entry and the security lady said she‚Äôs not asking. I called over phone but they said if I‚Äôm not allowed in they aren‚Äôt coming out because and I quote ‚Äúthis is Winnipeg after all and it‚Äôs an LC‚Äù as the young lady put it   However I totally get where you are coming from with needing some more help so to speak in the cold weather. Last winter I drank 1-2 beers most nights in the winter and drank 1-2 beers a week during the summer. Sober minds(at least the ones that aren‚Äôt stupid) aren‚Äôt meant to deal with the stress and lack of reason to live/positivity etc that comes with this lifestyle when in the cold and not having heat or much heat
z3u8wm,,ixqkdcr,I live in Quebec and it's nothing like you're describing. I understand having hardships but generalising an entire country based off of one rather crappy sounding city is a little much.
z3u8wm,,ixrh3jt,Well actually, IT IS EXACTLY how I‚Äôm describing. Regulated alcohol sold through the government is done across Canada. high alcohol prices are something Canada is known for and isn‚Äôt exclusive to one or two of the provinces. Canada does have many socialist policies and on the spectrum we are somewhat socialist. All of that is true.   As I stated WINNIPEG is a complete shit hole riddled with crime and had theft issues at the liquor mart resulting in some enhanced security measures being taken. Are you trying to tell me that‚Äôs not true? üòÇ  If you actually had a counter argument you would‚Äôve made it instead of ignorantly saying ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not how it is!‚Äù And then shutting up   Everything I said is true and that‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt refute a thing.  But not shocked a Quebecer telling people they are wrong   The province who only survives because it‚Äôs subsidized by the rest of the country and yet constantly berates the rest of the country for how they do things and thinks they should be their own country üòÇ  Educate yourself before coming on here and making ignorant statements and calling someone out on something you don‚Äôt understand
z3u8wm,,ixq7hyp,Fortunately I can still score a tall can of 211 for about $2 and if only takes me 2 for a good buzz. That‚Äôs insane $50 for a damn 24. Stobe would have lost his mind.
z3u8wm,,ixrfw7u,For example: Just went to check the exact prices on 24‚Äôs and when on site I see that:  They have an advent calendar at the Liquor commission: 24 different craft beers all at the regular can size(355 ml)   NOT the king cans(2 beer and 710 or 740 ml) or the tall boys(1.3 beers and 473 ml)  Well they want 178$ for the 24 beers‚Ä¶..  But I was a bit off on 24‚Äôs   Sure they do often sell for 50-60 but there are actually a decent amount at about 43-48$   Better but still stupidly overpriced.  Yeah if I want to get buzzed I try to do 2 king cans too as I can choose lesser quality in king cans and get a slightly better price. Even then though I usually have to only have 1 a night because of the costs.
z3u8wm,,ixosjnu,In NY it's the same. I've learned to just cut back on other things, cut things completely off that are meaningless to me ( had to be honest with myself a ton it was hard) and just work as much as I can but I used weed as a form of reward and not as a self sabotaging coping mechanism. It's a huge different type of satisfaction when you reward yourself with it rather than go to it when times are hard. Reason why I picked weed because rather than other things like alcohol & cigarettes ( yes I know they are cheaper) but they'll ruin ya health much faster plus it's self sabotaging to get pissed drunk then having to work the next morning.
z3u8wm,,ixvo9rx,I buy those dollar 99 banana singles from the liquor store. Dollar here in America. Not sure how much in Canada. But they're so much quicker cheaper than beer. Wonder if they have them in Canada.
z3u8wm,,ixvyrkc,Send a link of it. Not sure what you are talking about

z3u8wm,,ixvzqln,Hmm! I do love bananas and banana flavoured things and that‚Äôs high alcohol. Never have seen them at the LC‚Äôs that I‚Äôve seen but I see them on the online Site! Only problem is they are 3.00$ here‚Ä¶ so after taxes looking at like 3.36-3.40 for it. So it‚Äôs about the same amount of alcohol and price as a cheap tall boy (473 ml) beer here.  I‚Äôll take a look for em When I‚Äôm able to go back into the LC. Another comment on this thread I explain  that lol

z37sw0,ixkrisu,,>don‚Äôt want to live in a car or stay at a shelter  Do you want to pay for the repairs on the car... the repair bill you are stuck paying?  I'm sure you don't want to pay that.... but you are.  I'm sure that is because whether or not you \*want\* to, you HAVE to pay that bill.  Do you \*want\* to have a bad credit score?  Of course not.... but you do, regardless of how you feel.  Do you \*want\* to sleep on a sidewalk in the open air in a tent?  I highly doubt it.  Can you see where I'm going with this?  Whether or not you \*want\* to live in the car, or stay at a shelter... those are your best options.  Your girlfriend has a far better chance of getting into a women's shelter, than you have for finding a bed.  Both because she \*is\* a woman and is eligible for space in a women's only shelter... and because she is pregnant.  I'm going to tell you something hard.  **It isn't love if you try to talk her OUT of staying at a women's shelter**.  If you have to be cold, so she can be warm.... you give up your coat and you shiver in silence.  If there is cover from the rain for only one... you let her stay dry while you get soaked.  So if you have to live in your car alone, while she stays at a Women's shelter... then that is what you do so she can be safe and in healthier conditions.  If you insist that you have to stay together... you love not being alone more than you love her or that child inside her.  It is your DUTY to provide better and more for your family, than you keep for yourself.  [This is a very comprehensive guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/wjvkjh/comprehensive_and_systematic_resource_guide_for/) that we keep pinned at the top of the posts.  It covers far more than you have to deal with.  It is chock full of information and links, to help you find assistance, low income housing, signing up for SNAP food stamps, etc.  Takt the time (since you've got two weeks) and read it through.  Some of it will apply to you, and some won't.
z37sw0,ixkl9pe,,Call 211 and look up other assistance on findhelp.org. Churches like the Salvation army also have hotel vouchers. Just be sure to call as many people and organizations as you can. If they ask, youre living in your car now. If you tell them your living with your mom now, you get dropped to the bottom of the list.  It's not the most ideal situation, but see if you can patch things up with your mom to buy you some time.   If things get bad, a shelter or car camping might be your only option until housing is secure. Look at r/urbancarliving to find helpful ways to stay warm. Fortunatly, you have some mild winters. Locate your local food bank.   Most importanly, remember you have each other. Things are about to get stressful, so remember to be patient, and know that you are stronger as a team. Stay warm, and good luck!
z37sw0,ixkl6wq,,If you‚Äôre kicked out on the first of the month then you have 1 week, not 2.
z37sw0,ixkfyzq,,Join the military.
z37sw0,,ixkg9ji,Don‚Äôt want to be away from my son, she‚Äôs 6 months right now.
z37sw0,,ixkgi2f,Enjoy living in your car.
z37sw0,,ixkhf6r,Not that I think it's a good choice but your son would almost certainly be born well before you shipped to basic. The army is the fastest at getting people out and it would likely be 6 months to a year before you even left.
z37sw0,,ixl92vb,I think debt affects enlistment eligibility
z37sw0,,ixxa8xe,I believe this is correct, they ask much about finances.  Probably be able to find it under a debt to income ratio clause.
z37sw0,,ixkhpqx,How does that help the problem?
z37sw0,,ixkk2uk,He could support his family
z37sw0,,ixkk9iu,In like a year... Vietnam is over they're not just grabbing people off the streets and handing them a rifle anymore.
z37sw0,,ixla1h1,having served in the military i can tell you that you could be gone to basic in any branch fairly quickly. might not get your dream job or whatever; but you‚Äôd be paid, fed, and have a roof over you(and your families) head. where did you get your figure of 6 months to a year? that‚Äôs not consistent with my experience or those i know
z37sw0,,ixlah99,Having served in the military probably much more recently I can tell you 6 months to a year is the quickest you can get out with the army. The marines, navy, and airforce are much longer processes if the latter two will even take you.
z37sw0,,ixlbe4z,i just got out of the marine corps in july. the maximum amount of time a person can generally be in the dep is one year. it is of course dependent upon each individual persons situation how long they will be in the dep but for the most part it was never very long in my experience or those who i know personally. with how bad every branch is hurting for people right now i would have a hard time believing it is normal for folks to be sitting around for half a year or more on average. maybe so tho
z37sw0,,ixml2go,When does a family get housing, the day the recruit goes into basic?  Do active military people get paid by the week, or the month?  How long would it be before his girlfriend saw money from him, after he enlisted?  This still leaves the potential issue of his girlfriend living on the streets while pregnant, for an amount of time.  That's why I'm asking how long that amount of time will be.
z37sw0,,ixmnsv9,definitely there would be an interim period where they would face those struggles and i think the comment you made at the top of the post addressed that well.  assuming he enlisted, he would begin to get paid the day that he got to boot camp biweekly. if he is married and has a child on the way(i‚Äôm honestly not sure if they consider that a dependent but i am going to assume they do), he would get basic allowance for housing for the price of rent where his wife and dependent are living starting on day one. some of the guys i went through boot camp with who were married made a ridiculous amount of money more than i did; probably 4-5x more.   while in basic training he would have an opportunity to send as much of his money home as he wanted, up to and including his entire paychecks(which again includes cost of rent in the area his wife is living PLUS his regular salary). he wouldn‚Äôt really need that money in training as everything is paid for.   after he got out of training and sent to his duty station, he would have the option to bring his wife out to him(paid by the government) and either live on base in free housing or live off of base and be paid BAH for his housing(which makes off base housing free in nearly 100% of cases, most of the time they end up pocketing money after rent).  there still would be that rocky period to begin with which you gave great advice for. i can‚Äôt personally say how long it would take to get to boot camp but again in my experience it was never very long. i couldn‚Äôt imagine a very eager and motivated person not being able to ship out within at least 2 months, but again may be wrong‚Ä¶anyways, to recap, starting at day one of basic and everyday thereafter they would be taken care of. if the military does one thing good, it‚Äôs taking care of married service members. the quality of life between married and non married is quite disparaging.
z37sw0,,ixntk7b,THey might get married... who knows.  They aren't now.  So... two weeks after he got into basic, she'd see some support.  Assuming he gets into basic right away, she's only homeless in her condition for two weeks.  If they make him wait a month before he goes in... they are homeless for a month, and then she's homeless for another two weeks.  Assuming she can get a place to stay with his first check.
z37sw0,,iy3qu7v,Honestly this sounds like the best move. Him enlisting while she stays at a women's shelter. With how bound and determined he sounds about staying with her and the child, I see no reason why they shouldn't get married right away and reap those benefits.
z37sw0,,ixkl4gd,Yes they are pretty selective nowadays.
z37sw0,ixkowtj,,Are you or your girlfriend on CalFresh? If so there may be a program available for you. Going to a shelter is your best bet bc they can fill out a VSPDAT which determines how in need of housing y‚Äôall are. It‚Äôs a ranking system, the more at risk you are the better.  There will be a waitlist but get on it as soon as you can. Also apply for section 8. Los Angeles may have a different name for VSPDAT.  Also check out catholic charities.
z37sw0,,ixkpeoy,She‚Äôs trying to get on it, but she just needs some more paperwork.
z37sw0,,ixkz36e,What kind of paperwork
z37sw0,,ixkzm8l,Pay stubs from her previous job
z37sw0,ixkr9fc,,Hey I know u said you're in LA county, but u can try calling 211 (just like dialing 911) or go to their website. They are service that provides information throughout Orange County but I believe that they do have information for LA County too. They can help you find services for anything.   Also I know it might sound bad but you might want to consider telling them that you are in fact living in your car at the moment just because they'll put you at higher up on the list to receive vouchers or housing or anything like that and I mean so long as you're not on lease or on a title for a home they can't verify it.  Get in contact with social services ASAP. Regardless if you have all the paperwork that you need or not sometimes if the situation is a big enough emergency they will let you receive services or get you started on receiving Services before you have all the paperwork that you need.
z37sw0,ixqzzoh,,It sounds like you're still pretty young.  My advice? Join the military. This requires a (mostly) clean criminal record, a high school diploma and generally decent physical health. But it will do something that all the short-term solutions we can offer you won't: break the cycle.
z37sw0,ixklfoa,,Maybe look into finding a roommate? If you search ‚Äúroommates‚Äù or ‚Äúroommate needed‚Äù on Google, some websites will pop up where you can put in your city, state and find people with available rooms for rent. It‚Äôll be a lot cheaper than renting an apartment. And there are couple roommate websites that have people allowing a couple to move into a room.  And yes there‚Äôs plenty of resources for homeless people or people who are about to be homeless. Search ‚Äúhomeless resources‚Äù in your area, or call social services and they‚Äôll guide you in the right direction.   Motel/hotels have extended stays were you pay $200-300 every one to two weeks, just have to be careful because your stuff can get stolen if you leave your room unattended (I had stuff stolen staying in a motel before).   And especially because you have a baby on the way, there should be more resources available to you. I also suggest setting up a go-fund me to assist you and your family.
z37sw0,,ixkq3nx,Due to trauma she has a lot of trust issues, but i will discuss it with her. Do you know where i can find a motel/hotel with extended pay for around those prices?
z37sw0,,ixlinna,That's going to be tough.  I just checked a couple of discount chain motels (Extended Stay America, Motel 6) in LA and rates are more like $100/night even on a long stay.
z37sw0,,izbf2c6,Yup
z37sw0,,ixmmuqf,Last night, Kayak was listing motel rooms at the Motel 6 in El Centro California for $31 a night.  Now, they are listing at $69.  Priceline had them at $39... and now also says $69.  Regarding the one-off or no-name motels, they are typically even cheaper.  Just before Covid, they were down to $21 a night in a couple of the seedier motels.  Motel room daily pricing changes, depending on the demand.  With the holiday, prices go up.    With the weekend, prices go up.  They will drop in about a week... and they will go up again as we approach Christmas.  I don't expect you to spend 3-5 hours heading south-southeast, just to stay in a cheap Imperial County motel.  You are in LA... and that's an expensive city to be in at the worst of times.
z37sw0,,izbezlb,In La it‚Äôs 90 plus a day so 700 a week -
z37sw0,iypn7d4,,What's your long term plan?  Someone mentioned joining the military below.  As a veteran, and as a person that has worked with the homeless in your area, that's actually a good long term decision.  Do a non combat role aligned with the career path you wish to ultimately become.  Here are some other benefits  My kid goes to college for free.  All of the aches and pains I have now in my 40's, I get paid for by the VA, whereas if you stay out there, you will maybe hope for SSDI or something that won't be enough.  My disability payments could take care of the rent in most places, meaning that even if I am down bad, I will be able to keep a roof over my head.  Not to mention the education benefits which if you go to school while you are in the military, you may be able to transfer benefits to your wife, and let her build up her career so that when you get out, she's already established, and you can build yourself up.   You get out, and you get a government job, and boom, you got a decent retirement, and a cushy job where as long as you just work average, you got a decent retirement, and a ridiculous amount of days off. Unless you got something better, this is probably one of the most surefire ways to change the trajectory of your life, and your families for you to become the provider I'm sure you would want to be.  Unfortunately, the price of being a soldier is that you will have to suffer and miss people. I did 2 deployments, I know the sting. But the life I can provide for my family now with the doors opened up is better than what I could have done coming from the neighborhood I came from.   &#x200B;  Switching gears.  She's pregnant, so she needs to look for resources for women.  If you don't have a ring on it, she should look for single resources as well.  211, cal fresh, look into Workforce innovation and Opportunity Act  (WIOA) for training for you and your girl for better jobs. If you need side hustles, Security Guard companies are always hiring, and you can work the graveyard shifts to not have to sleep in the cold at night.  Get that money before the kid arrives.  Speaking of which. How far along is this pregnancy?  Shot of honesty here, neither of you are doing the right thing by bringing a kid in the world you can't take care of.  If Abortion is off the table, then that above paragraph in reference to the military  is pretty much the blueprint for you to make amends to this kid, but you and your girl need to be prepared to be uncomfortable because that's the price to pay to get to where you want to be in life.  &#x200B;  If you chose the military route, you have the time from basic to permanent duty station where you will be apart.  You don't need your paycheck because the military will take care of you, and if she's connected to resources, and you are still "single," then your paycheck provides extra support to her and your kid until you reunite.

z36kt7,ixksof3,,>So the jig will soon be up for me.  Turn that jig into a jug.... and go **jugging**.  That's where you take your gas can down to the nearest gas station, and you ask people for a single gallon of gas.  When it is full... you put the gas in your tank where it belongs.  This is a time tested method that works.  It is used by Rubber Tramps, Dirty Kids, and Rainbow Family all the time.... almost as much as they will fly signs.  So where you see an end coming... many others see an opportunity to haul the red can down to the station for an afternoon.  >I haven't showered in two weeks  I know the feeling.  I live in the desert, and have to make choices like "Do I wash, or do I save the water to drink and stay alive?"  It won't make you feel better... but I've gone longer.  Currently... I've gone longer.  No chance you could leave the car temporarily to hoof it to the gym, considering how the lack of shower is weighing on your mind?  Is there any reason why it wouldn't be safe, unoccupied, for a few hours?  I assume you are on SNAP food stamps if you are in the USA, so your food is taken care of.  You could pick a corner and fly a sign, if you'd rather the cash instead of the gas.
z36kt7,,ixwz4aa,Honestly, in the desert, you could take a dust bath. Last resort, but, if you get a fine tooth comb, you can manage your hair. Your body will produce all the oils you need for your skin and hair. If you have large pores, you might be ducked.
z36kt7,,ixxd6w2,>Honestly, in the desert, you could take a dust bath.  Here we call that a Slab Patina.  After 4 years... I've found that dust plus sweat equals mud.  Not clean skin.  Dust plus oily skin also equals mud.
z36kt7,,ixxzd5i,Lol, that's a dirt bath, as in not doing due diligence to remove as much soil afterwards. It's not ideal, none of it is ideal..
z36kt7,,iyf3323,I like some of the suggestions I have received, this is a good one. I cannot buy a jug at the moment but when the opportunity comes in the near future. I will buy a jug and keep it in the car.  I live in a state with long distances between places. However, I finally got a shower YAS!!! Once the water hit my skin, it literally felt like heaven. My bottom is as smooth as a baby. I literally wanted to cry.  How is it like living in a a desert? I live in a tropical climate. Its hot, humid and sticky here.  Confession: I owe money on my car and it's the only thing that keeps me from complete destruction. I'm buying time until my circumstances change.  As crazy as it seems, obtaining SNAP is not possible in my circumstances.    My gym membership is due in a few days, I won't be able to pay it which sucks. But taking a shower felt so good. Man, I miss living indoors.
z36kt7,ixkm84v,,I've been there before, we've all been there before. Vent away buddy! It sucks when I lost my car. Eventually I had to move it and it wouldn't turn over. But, and this may not work for you, but hell, it's worth a try. If you can get a gas can and make it to a gas station, I've asked people before if they were willing to buy me a gallon. You get maybe a couple chances before the station calls the cops, but while people pump, first apologize for bothering them, explain how you're in a real tight spot and ask if they are willing to fill a bit of your can. I find older guys with big trucks were the most willing to help me out. Might be different for you but worth the try to keep your car for another couple days. Good luck, and remember, we're always here for you to vent and get a sympathetic ear.
z36kt7,,iy825qq,Why would the gas station call the cops? Also yeah, there are people who are usually always willing to help :)
z36kt7,,iyb1noa,For the same reason everyone calls the cops, someone who makes them uncomfortable is loitering on private property.  If I hang out in front for too long, someone would come out, point to my can, ask if they can help me, if I told them what I was really there for, they'd say I was harassing their customers, if I said, nothing, just hanging out, then I was loitering. Either way, they don't want you just hanging out. Usually they ask you to leave before calling the police, but I learned pretty quick that that's not always the case.
z36kt7,,iyf3vk9,The thought of losing my car is so frightening, I cannot sleep comfortably at all. It's my home and final thing I have that keeps me from total destruction. My car is where I sleep, where I eat. I have all of my documents inside. It's neatly organized etc. I keep it extremely clean to the best of my ability.   I'm sorry to hear that you lost your car. I pray for you dude. Its not easy for any of us.    Thank you for the tips and I will be venting some more <3
z36kt7,,iyfah5f,I feel you friend. The fear of losing your car, how cold it got before I learned to insulate my car, I was a straight zombie during the day because of how I wasn't able to sleep. What you've got going for you is that you've got things organized. That's great for two reasons, 1- you know where everything is and if you get in a jam, you can grab the most important things and 2- if it looks neat, people harass you less. I packed all my bedding and kept it in the trunk, looked like a regular car with a couple duffle bags in the back seat. Buddy of mine kept his sleeping bag and pillows out. You could see his camp stove and cooler through the window. Guy got harassed all the time! The best way to be left alone is to fly under the radar. Good luck friend, I hope to see you on the other side of winter, your car running strong. Lots of love and care!
z36kt7,ixlf8do,,When you get a chance, get a spray bottle to take showers with. It's not as satisfying as a real shower but it's a way to feel clean anyway (and brush your teeth and wash various other things).  And yeah, I think the wise thing to do is ask people for money. I don't enjoy doing it, and fortunately haven't had to in a long time, but it works, if you keep at it, and you can at least get a few gallons in your car.  Oddly, in my personal experience, losing my car made my life easier. There wasn't this big, money hungry machine that needs its paperwork and all that crap weighing me down. Once I accepted the fact that a had to pare down to what I could carry in a pack I relaxed somewhat.  What worked for me wouldn't work for everyone though, so if you feel you need to keep the car (you could sell it after all, and buy at least a bus ticket, gear, things you need for work, I dunno), you can try asking around at businesses for any odd jobs they might let you do. They might look at you like you have three heads, or they might be rude but there's a good chance to get a little money if you ask around like that and it may help you make connections.  Your post says you want to vent so sorry if that's too much advice. Venting is cool, but you are a human being in a tough spot, nothing more, nothing less. You have options. There are good times and good people out there even though sometimes it seems cruel to be hopeful. I'm giving you advice I can't follow myself half the time here but I do hope things get better for you.
z36kt7,ixkis0c,,What you gonna just give in to starvation and death cause you don't wanna beg? Welcome to the club of people who've had to beg at one point or another.  I remember my first time and how impossible it felt, it ain't so bad. Honestly everyone should have to experience it, the world would be a lot better place. Old cardboard walk of shame.   I ain't got no shame about it, what's shameful is being a coward, and too cowardly and proud to do what's necessary to stay healthy and alive, or killing yourself, or wallowing in self pity. What's shameful is that we're letting people starve and freeze when there's so much waste and extra and it takes no effort for the rich to swipe their card and feed someone, or give them a couple of gallons of gas to keep their home.   It is where God put you, learn from it. God gave everyone what they have, and some times the gambling man is rich and the working man is poor. The only thing that makes one human better than the other is their deeds, their faith, their character. Whatever we got, it's our test. This is yours, so pull your boots up cause harder working and better men have been reduced to less, and it's all hopeless anyways cause death is coming for everyone whether they're rich or poor. You can place your hope in what is decaying before your eyes, or you can place your hope in God, and that He will forgive the worst of your sins, and you will be spared the true suffering, the suffering of Hell.

z36kt7,ixmojao,,Ok you need to find another job. ask a church for help and reach out to local homeless outreach so you can shower. Is there a walmart near you? Appky there and sleep in the parking loti n your car. I bought 2 gallons of gas for someone last night. Go to a gas station and ask for help or a truck stop. They may let you use a shower there too.  You have got to get yourself out of this situation. Why is your employer cuting your hours? Talk to them or get another job soe grocery stores and fast food even pay daily.
z36kt7,,iyan4mw,This is an excellent suggestion. I like the idea of going to a church. I feel like they will be less judgmental.  My employer cut my hours because a slight reduction in business. I work night shift jobs only because of physical deformities.

z2ianr,ixi5cb7,,I had a short answer I was going to test... but then I remembered that I hate this short-attention-span, Twitter culture of everything having to be short.  The art of communication isn't dead.... but it most certainly has a worrisome cough.  You aren't alone in wanting to help.  You aren't alone in worrying that people will misuse cash if you just hand it to them.  An individual in Denver, Colorado just started a test Basic Income program.  He invested in Tesla, and turned around and used the money to create a Universal Income program.  The viability is being tested right now with 800 people.  It was a VERY carefully screened group, and doesn't include any mentally ill, and it doesn't include anyone who could possibly appear to be likely to use the free money to support substance abuse.  [The title of the post itself is a little click-baity](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/yqbsw1/addicted_and_severely_mentally_ill_homeless/), but the article itself is very informative.  **Most importantly, it shows what ONE PERSON can do**.  Then there is [Bill Greehey and his Haven for Hope](https://www.havenforhope.org/about/founder/).  There's another person who saw the same problem you see, and pretty much built a campus in San Antonio, Texas that currently helps about 1700 homeless.  One individual who led a charge to attack part of this problem.  So... what can one person do?  There are two examples.  Don't have any spare millions hanging around for anything like one of these things?  They both have something in common.  They both involve INTERVIEWING the people they help, before they get helped.  If you go down to the Social Services office to sign up for food stamps... they interview you before they help you.  That's three different kinds of help... and they all involve interviews before giving assistance.  Three.  That's a pattern.  Sure... they don't interview before you eat at a soup kitchen... but then again, people don't go to a soup kitchen to receive disability insurance assistance.  The fact that it is where the food is, kind of takes care of the need for an interview.  You know why people are there.  HOWEVER... I do have an exception to this.  At the Union Mission in Olympia, WA, everyone is  asked in the morning, if there is anyone who needs a shower or laundry.  Every day, everyone there is asked this in the morning.  Now... a single question like that isn't really an interview... but homeless people are ASKED what assistance they want, when there are options like laundry and showers available at a soup kitchen.  You want to help people.  You want to give them stuff.  You don't want to give them money.  So here you are asking what to do.  You could... talk to a person, and ask them what you can do for them... give them an example so they know how much money you are talking about spending.  THEN, you go and get it and bring it back to them.  THAT way, you are getting THAT person what THEY want.  You aren't getting THAT person what some stranger on the internet says they want.  You... interview... before you help.  It is so simple.  You talk to an individual, you treat them LIKE an individual, and you help with their individual needs.  Too much personal interaction?  Find any one of a number of organizations that need volunteers, and volunteer.  Could be a homeless shelter, could be a soup kitchen, could be a clothing or food bank, could be an outreach program that drives around at night checking in on homeless in the cold.  The system in place to assist homeless back into some kind of homed life, is severely underfunded for the number of people who need the help.  This is why many of the organizations depend on donations to stay open.  This is why many of the organizations are run by churches.  This is why many of the organizations depend on VOLUNTEERS.  There are homeless shelters that decide how many beds are available, based on the number of VOLUNTEERS they have to oversee and assist.  They could have 50 beds, but will only allow occupancy of 10 or 20 of them, if they are understaffed.  So, right there.... you've got two ways to help.  Either go, talk to a homeless individual and ask them what they need before you get it.... or find somewhere in your local area where you can volunteer and make a difference.
z2ianr,,iy3wvrc,So a program as started that excludes the people who absolutely need it the most? How very American I hate this place.   OP just give money, when I give money I do not care a bit if they want to use it for drugs or alcohol or to buy a fucking toilet seat and name it Bob and marry it. People know what they need when they need it and I truly do not begrudge someone using drugs homeless or otherwise.
z2ianr,,iy5xmtd,>So a program as started that excludes the people who absolutely need it the most? How very American I hate this place.  No... a **TEST** to see if that kind of program would be viable under the BEST of conditions.  A test of a program.  And if he proves it is viable, then he alone won't have to fund the next, much larger group that gets money.  What is there to hate?  It is a TEST... not the actual program.  I said in my comment "**The viability is being tested right now with 800 people**."  Did you miss the part where it is only a test?

z2ianr,ixgxobu,,Thank you for recognising that as judgemental and rude.  I wrote a long reply, but it was very long winded. Being homeless and not a drug user, I get very upset that people disregard us like that.  I really appreciate you can see that we're individuals.   Some have been forced through inconceivably awful suffering, condemned to this path, then forgotten, at the hands of our fellow humans. So it hurts to be disregarded as probably just a drug user, or probably been in jail.  I'd probably buy a casket of water.
z2ianr,,ixgzsuw,woww thanks so much for that award, that's exactly how i felt üôÇ
z2ianr,ixhb5g4,,All homeless aren't drug users or alcoholics. Judge each case separately because a good portion are.cash will help the most but pretty much anything will help offer food, water, in your case it's cold so maybe a coffee, hot chocolate, hot sandwich. I've only been homeless about a month now and its crazy how I'm viewed. Never done a hard drug in my life nor do I drink. I'm just trying to take care of my dog and get off the streets.
z2ianr,ixjsymy,,honestly my answer is to ask! you never know what a person may need, its impossible to anticipate every individuals needs and its also unlikely to find a universally helpful thing (other than water and good socks üòÅ) so if you have the time i would suggest asking those you see frequently!
z2ianr,ixgyru8,,You could maybe see what services are available for homeless in your area, and talk to the organisations for advice on how you can help. I find some centres more genuine than others. Personally I feel more comfortable at non-religious affiliated places.
z2ianr,ixikv80,,Why not donate to a shelter or a food pantry? Volunteer? Not every homeless person uses drugs or drinks, but you can‚Äôt tell in most cases and you don‚Äôt want to be an enabler. My local soup kitchen has vouchers you can buy to hand out to people for free meals, which is another great alternative
z2ianr,ixkjkfe,,Females should be careful. There are homeless who are completely different around women. If you aren't sure, say hi and keep walking. Alot of people give alot on a daily basis.
z2ianr,ixhc72j,,Have you done a little looking around at existing aid organizations in your area? It might help to start with a call there to see what gaps need filling and possibly just get some good information from those already doing assistance work.   As for providing immediate help to people you meet I‚Äôve found what is really helpful is to be prepared. I hate coming across someone in need and fumbling for money, a bottle of water etc. I live in an area that is very cold in the winter (adjust this based on season) and keep a large Ziploc bag in my car with some:  Hot Hands and Hot Feet, snacks (granola bars, nuts, dried fruit, jerky), hygiene wipes, pads/tampons, a Dunkin‚Äô Donuts gift card, wool socks, a mini flashlight, a small plastic poncho, an emergency Mylar blanket, and a mini first aid kit.  This might not be possible if you walk or take public transit, and the needs of your community may be different. I‚Äôm not sure that anyone knows what would be most beneficial more than the people currently living unsheltered. It might help to ask? See what would be of use?   I‚Äôd like to think the concern that the money may be used for drugs comes from a place of not wanting to contribute to further harm, but it is reductive, judgmental, and unfair. I know many people struggling with homelessness do have untreated substance use disorder, and that‚Äôs a public and private health crisis, but I‚Äôd hate to see that used as a reason to ignore the needs of our neighbors.  Good luck!
z2ianr,ixgtzqi,,Offer to buy a hot drink such as coffee, hot chocolate, or tea. Maybe hand out hand warmers or fast food gift cards.  Don't give out money.  Drug use is common among the homeless. Drug addicts will likely use any money they get their hands on for more drugs.  Don't try to be a hero either. You are not responsible for helping any of those people. Some people are beyond help. I say this through personal experience with my mom.
z2ianr,,ixhnwde,I‚Äôll buy booze for a homeless person if they ask. As a former alcoholic, I know that it can literally kill them if they don‚Äôt get their fix. Who am I to judge?
z2ianr,,ixgu2ht,Thanks for your advice, it‚Äôs most certainly not a saviour complex, me myself I make good money at the moment working remotely and I just feel an obligation to pay some of it forward.
z2ianr,,ixgufzq,I usually get hot drinks from 7-Eleven late at night when it is coldest. Would be pretty cool if Starbucks is open 24/7. A hot drink in the cold works miracles.

z2ianr,,ixgu3tu,That‚Äôs very solid advice tho, I think I‚Äôll buy gloves and Starbucks cards :)
z2ianr,,ixj2bx5,It's pointless to buy gift cards instead of giving cash if the object is to prevent spending on booze or drugs , they can trade the cards, better to just give cash, maybe they'd prefer a cheaper 711 coffee plus another item for the cost of Starbucks
z2ianr,,iy20n2q,Was thinking similarly myself.  The top replies hit this one on the head, ASK what is needed, then return with what you can get.   Personally, yeah I like coffee, but certainly do not need expensive Starbucks.  Just plain black, easier on the stomach the better.  Honestly, I‚Äôd drink hot water and put the money elsewhere personally.  Not completely against gift cards‚Ä¶they‚Äôre just severely limiting and as pointed out, not always a sensible choice to purchase goods and services with.  Best to Ask what is needed first, could be socks, gloves, etc. You just won‚Äôt know, unless you have that conversation.  I‚Äôm also not entirely against giving money out either‚Ä¶just depends.

This place is kind of like... the Big Rock Candy mountain, if you catch my double entendr√© there.  Considering the nature of the place itself... it's almost a voluntary prison of sorts.  It could be a Devil's Island, if properly "advertised".  Wouldn't the average Tweaker just love it if there was a place to go where there were no cops (untrue, but whatever), and the crystals flowed from bag to pipe like rain in the jungle, and you never went without food or water (untrue, but whatever), and people just partied and had fun all the time?  I mean.. that's what people already think about this place... many of whom are here.  Maybe people who have issues with neighbor camps, should tell them about this place and how to get here.  Send their troublesome Tweakers to the Big Painted Salvation Mountain.  Just a matter of ramping up the advertising.  I mean... it is kind of like living at a beach as well... lots of sand.  Gonna require a catchy tune for the ad spots though.  Maybe new lyrics to Big Rock Candy Mountain.  You.  Your post inspired that.  I'm not BLAMING you... you just fell into the unpaid position of a muse for a few moments.

So one day it was raining and windy and I was just doing my tours and on property we had this enclosed bus stop, and I walked up and a guy was sleeping there, and I had no intention of waking the guy up, but as I approach he woke up anyway, And he saw me in my uniform and I guess he figured I was trying to get rid of him, but I just hit my point in the bus stop, waved at the guy, told him to try to stay dry, and I left.   It was a Saturday, there were no bosses there, nobody had told me to get rid of the guy, so I figured why should I make his day even worse?   If you can't help someone, at least don't hurt them.

z1ns5f,,ixelsgq,Some colleges are strict about student IDs after a certain time, but I also would suggest going to a college library (Uni or Community). Sometimes they are 24hrs and at the time of me posting this it's November, so most are closed around Thanksgiving. Yet with that you could charge your devices and surf the web as long as you need hopefully.      I'd suggest "getting/buying" a battery charging pack that's about 4000-6000+ mA. As this would allow you to skip the library when needed and charge your devices without the need of an outlet. I'd suggest getting/buying around 2-3. This allows you to go days without needing an outlet and anytime your near one then you could always charge the battery pack that has the lowest percentage.     Hope this helps!

z1ns5f,ixggig1,,If you're going to stay at the apartment you need to be discreet, move your car around unless it's a spot you are  paying for and assigned. Be ready to be out of the car before people are going out to their own in the morning, anyone parked near you may report you and it's unlikely management there will be okay with the situation. Stay organized and neat, a messy car means bugs or rodents, and if you're lucky enough to avoid those it gets stressful. Arrange your clothes by what you want to wear, plan out as many outfits as you can and keep them together. Get a sun shade, it's normal to leave in a car window all the time and is great for privacy. If you can put one in the back too. It's getting colder so layers are super important. A sleeping bag is the best, my sleeping pad is what truly makes my jeep comfortable. You want a layer below you as well as above. Fuzzy socks are life, and I actually use my old COVID masks to cover my eyes and nose while sleeping. My nose is always cold and it's the best thing I've found to help. The library is amazing and totally free, sometimes they have rooms you can book for privacy for things like zoom calls. If you don't have a card find an old bill and your id and get one. I love coffee and spend a couple mornings a week at starbucks, free wifi and always tons of outlets. Planet fitness is great for showers, if you're there during slow times it'd be easy to charge your things in the changing room. Good luck to you, I agree with the others who said do anything to not lose your car. Having it as a shelter is so much better than being on the street.
z1ns5f,ixdfxa1,,>how \[will I\] be able to charge my laptop and phone  The same ways you would charge them if you were living rough.... as well as being able to charge them when the vehicle is running.  As has been suggested.. libraries.  Since you have access to money, you can purchase portable battery banks, or even a small "solar generator".  Instead of using the solar generator with panels though... you plug it into the wall and charge it when you are at work... or on the days you don't work, you charge it in a library.  Then, you've got power for the whole night.  [This is a 65 watt portable phone charger on steroids.](https://www.amazon.com/65Watts-Portable-Charger-Battery-Notebooks/dp/B07P87JTVT/)  It is rated at 88Wh has an AC outlet and will charge a laptop.  It is large-ish, but will still fit into a pocket.  That one goes for $80.  [This is an example of a small solar generator](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Generator-Flashlight-Home-Outdoor-Emergency/dp/B096D8RYPL/).  It is rated at 138Wh, and also is designed to power devices that require AC.  It isn't very large, but it won't fit into a pocket.  It is also, right now, currently $80.  These are two examples... and they are ONLY examples.  However, you charge them when you are near an outlet for any length of time... and then you use them when you aren't.  Can't order stuff from Amazon?  Home Depot sells an expensive Ryobi battery bank.  Harbor Freight sells the much less expensive Jackery brand solar generators in their stores.  Of course, if you are handy... and depending on the vehicle... you could just purchase a cheap $30, 400 watt inverter, a second car battery, and a 12v DC to DC battery charger.  You charge the battery when it is low, by running the car.  When you drain the battery, you don't drain the main car battery... only the second one.  If you have an older car, you can also do this by using a VSR... Voltage Sensitive Relay... it is a solenoid that allows power to go in one direction, and monitors the current to avoid overcharging.  So, when the car was running, both batteries would charge.  When the car was off... using the second battery wouldn't drain the first.  But... a 12v DC to DC charger can be cheap, and definitely easier to use and connect up.  Depending on the car battery... the total outlay at Walmart that day would be... $125 maybe?  $30 for the inverter, $20 for the DC charger, $57 for the cheap car battery... and what... $15 for the core charge.  Then, you've got a separate battery in your car, just for you to use when the car isn't running.  And I haven't even touched on the idea of actually setting up solar panels to collect your electricity.
z1ns5f,ixerb1z,,There‚Äôs outlets on the outside walls of pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS, and you can go into fast food restaurants and cafes and sit down and charge your phone on a wall plug.

I'd get a handle on that first, but with way more experience, I've almost never found a place they'd let you do that. Maybe cop a storage unit at a ghetto low rent place, you might be able to pull that.   You will almost have to be mobile to keep the car from being towed, or otherwise in an agreement a landowner. Generally living in a car is moving frequently, it's the expectation if you don't move you're going to have to interact with someone very enthusiastic about being able to tell you to move. Maybe try the homeless shelter, they might let you park there.   If you have any other options, any favors to call in, parental help, etc. Now's the time, before you lose the car and then God help ya the streets are no place to live for anyone, much less a woman, and you'll find the world a much different experience than you've ever had before in how it receives you and treats you.

z1i7cf,,ixdfo5b,No, the OP would have legally been given either 60 days, of if she is considered a lodger (ie, rented just a room) would have been required to be given notice equal to the length of the rent payment period (ie, if she's month to month, she needs to be given 30 days.)     As she mentions her husband was also "evicted" then she does not fall under Special Rules for Single Family Lodgers, so she would have legally been afforded 60 days notice.  If she still does leave after the 60 days, then they would start the eviction process, which in such a tenant friendly state as California, would have taken a minimum of 6 weeks.

You just lost so much... but you managed to keep hold of the shame?  Let it go, for your mental health, if for no other reason.

z1i7cf,,ixe8fr2,And... if this was for living purposes going in, you'd get the smaller van, instead of the box truck.  It would be foolish not to get the insurance... true.  However, if one was considering renting a U-Haul to live out of... I think standard conventions are off the table.

z0nouc,ix6k2uc,,first of all i just want to say thank you, i got way more advice and help offers than i could have ever possibly expected. there were even people PMing me offers for supplies. so far i took a bunch of your advice, using a gym for showers helps big time and i bought a tent alongside some tarps like you all said. i still have a job so im able to supply myself with food and other stuff so i dont have to worry about any of that.   today someone found my spot, my tent was partially unzipped and all the stashes where i hid bags of various supplies were left uncovered after they threw off the tarps. strangely though it doesn‚Äôt seem like they went through any of my bags or went inside my tent as everything was exactly as i left it besides the tarps.  i am glad they only just looked and didn‚Äôt steal anything, but very nervous now my stuffs been spotted.  i also don‚Äôt know what i should do during the winter, even with the multiple jackets and blankets i have im already shivering through the entire night getting little sleep. while definitely better than the chair i had, i don‚Äôt think my current setup will be feasible once it starts snowing. i cant move out to somewhere warm without quitting my job and abandoning a lot of supplies nor can i use a shelter due to them not lining up with my work schedule.
z0nouc,,ix6omof,First, your spot is blown. Time to move.  I camped out for two winters while working.  1st winter:  In my tent I had an air mattress with a 40¬∞ bag on top, a 10¬∞ mummy bag on top of that that I was in, and a thick comforter on top of that. An air mattress won't insulate you from the cold by itself. Put something between you and the mattress.   The second winter I bought a Mr Buddy heater, a 15lb propane tank and a 10' hose. Get the heater that is square. It's closer to the ground  to keep your feet warm if you need to change clothes before you bail in the morning. It's made for either the little one pound bottles or hooking to a big tank. They're made for tents. I had a tent that was big enough to stand up in, and could handle two queen size air mattresses. It was a Walmart six man tent. I kept the tank outside the tent and fed the hose through the opening for electrical cables.  Tent: Ozark Trail 6 Person Dome Outdoor Camping Tent https://www.walmart.com/ip/390708302  Heater: https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Heater-F232000-Indoor-Safe-Portable/dp/B002G51BZU/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?keywords=mr+buddy+heater&qid=1669000773&sr=8-2#  It has a built in regulator so don't get a hose with a regulator.  Hose: They make 3 of them. This one doesn't need a fuel filter. https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Heater-F232000-Indoor-Safe-Portable/dp/B002G51BZU/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?keywords=mr+buddy+heater&qid=1669000773&sr=8-2#  You can get a regular bbq propane tank anywhere. The first one is gonna run you about $60. After that you exchange them for around $20. Usually lasted me a month or so, and I never cared how much I was using. Also used it for a two burner stove. Just disconnect the hose from heater, screw into stove.  I wound up putting a 10x20 tarp over the tent and found some fleece used for crafts that I stuffed where the rainfly stood off the tent in front. I was smoking weed in a tshirt in 20 degrees.  You're probably gonna hear people who've never done it tell you not to put a heater in your tent. These are designed for it. Obviously don't do it in a short tent. I cooked in my tent too.  If you can swing it it's a sweet setup. I showed it to other homeless campers and they all bought the same stuff. None of us had an issue .
z0nouc,,ix9zf4e,Lots of good advice here. Just want to say refill your propane don‚Äôt exchange. You pay more for 30% less when you exchange. Only exchange when your bottle is out of date to get a current one you can refill.
z0nouc,,ix9zqch,‚òù And it's a couple bucks cheaper.
z0nouc,,iy2rg76,FYI same link both times
z0nouc,,ix6l0hi,Get thermals and a sleeping bag rated under 30. Tuck socks as gloves into the thermals, same with normal socks, a bunch of jackets and blankets dont beat this at all. Stay off the ground, a pallet and cardboard under tent will go a long way. You can additionally get a decent thermos, fill it with hot water (most gas stations have them) and then fill up a little Gatorade bottle a few times throughout the night as a little space heater that wont start a fire. Is possible to sleep decently warm throughout the night in a snowstorm.
z0nouc,,ix6lp56,will definitely pay attention to the thermals, cardboard and heater. what do you do to prevent the gatorade from falling over and spilling?   i already ended up finding out my tent is only waterproof when fully set up, causing all my pillows and blankets to be soaked until today where i got the money to wash everything. i really don‚Äôt want to go back to using a coat as a blanket again
z0nouc,,ix6uh4y,>	will definitely pay attention to the thermals, cardboard and heater.  And pallet. You want to be off the ground. The ground is a giant ice cube that wants to suck all the heat out of your body and a few sheets of cardboard won‚Äôt make a difference.   Get a pallet so you have an air gap between you and the frozen earth. Make an insulated nest on the pallet. Hell, if you can get a dozen lawnbags of dry leaves that would be great insulation and provide a bit of padding.  Edit: my grandparents used bricks wrapped in cloth to heat their beds at night. The bricks were set in front of the fireplace (campfire for you) and allowed to heat. Then they were wrapped in an old towel and put between the sheets to warm the bed.
z0nouc,,ixaioyu,Heating bricks or rocks is great. Urge everyone to make sure that you don't use wet or moist rocks though. You'd be surprised, but that moisture makes it into the center of the rock and can cause a violent explosion when heated to steam.
z0nouc,,ixaj7vt,I didn‚Äôt even think of that - you‚Äôre absolutely right. A wet rock in a campfire is nothing more than a grenade waiting to injure someone.

z0nouc,,ix7wt2a,i woke up to do my usual ritual of getting food, bathing and switching clothes. a few hours later i came back and the tarps on my stuff were thrown off and the first zipper door on my tent was partially unzipped. they didn‚Äôt steal anything and only looked, but judging by them not caring to put my stuff back the way it was im taking that as a message to gtfo. i was deep in the woods, so im assuming teenagers were just wandering around stumbled across my spot and got curious

z0nouc,,ix6rofr,yeah i never reply to them much, they never state their intention and im guessing because im not that experienced with homelessness theyre just trying to prey on me

z0nouc,,ix9v6l3,what are they trying to ‚Äúscam‚Äù though?
z0nouc,ix7gc5z,,Be careful on who trust. I love the homeless community and love my job within it, but not everyone is trustworthy. There are plenty of people with good intentions who will cook food and drive around town looking for people to give it to. But there are just as many who don't have good intentions. There could be a chance that food is drugged and they'll come to collect you later. What they will bring you into is everything you don't want to ever get trapped in. I saw that you have means for food, but just don't ever accept food unless it is from an actual out reach program who are currently doing out reach at that moment.   Saw that your spot was found. Time to move. You can also contact your local shelters to see if they have showers that are open to the public and what times those are. Also, apply for housing. There is various types of programs but all of them have a long wait list. Best to get on them as soon as you can. Right now their priority is people with children and those who are sleeping out in the cold. With you being out in the cold you will be at the top of their list. Depending on the program and what they have funding for.
z0nouc,ix70bxf,,I used GIS and delinquent tax records to find abandoned property to squat. If your area is modern enough to have electronic records on the internet, then you can search for a really good spot.
z0nouc,,ix712jk,do you have an in depth tutorial somewhere? sounds extremely useful
z0nouc,,ix72hhd,GIS is like Google maps, except it's with local property. Just internet search: Maken County GIS  Or: Metropolis City GIS  But GIS is useless without knowing what to look for.   There's normally a publicly available list of people and businesses who are behind on their property taxes because the government always wants their money. Many of these properties are abandoned and landlocked. I'm talking about raw land because you're not gonna find many abandoned houses.   If I find a property that 30+ years behind on their property taxes, then that's a good prospect. Also look for property owned by dead people.  Or you can just search the GIS map for property you already know is empty but you need to get the ownership information for it. Like something you drive by everyday but never really paid close attention to.   Also look for landlocked properties. These properties are abandoned because they have no legal easement (driveway connecting to the road) but... if there's no connection to the road, then nobody can see it from the road. üí°  Then the lowest hanging fruit is county/city delinquent tax foreclosure auctions. Here you're more like to find empty houses but it's not safe because it's easy for others to find the auction listing. Lots of people will come around to view the property before bidding at the auction.  Although, sometimes the tax foreclosure auctions will list junk property that absolutely no one is interested in. Like irregularly shaped or sized properties.

yzj4e3,ix1104o,,Bro we can't read "full story' because they make you download the app.  But to help cold people in general there's a great thing called body, hand/feet warmers. Those things you twist and squeeze and they become warm. A few of these will keep you warm good enough. One in each glove and sock and around the waistband. Easy
yzj4e3,,ix19q7k,I got you Piano Man!  Denver, CO Ways to help homeless people shivering in the Colorado cold creator avatar David Heitz 3 hours ago https://img.particlenews.com/image.php?url=2aFZpd_0jH3FHWJ00 Islandworks/Pixabay By David Heitz / NewsBreak Denver  (Denver, Colo.) So maybe you‚Äôve seen a homeless person shivering on the street, their breath visible it‚Äôs so cold. And at that point in time, maybe you decided you want to help.  Here‚Äôs a listing of ways you can help people experiencing homelessness during the winter. These ideas came from people who work with those experiencing homelessness, including Ayla Ray Leonard and Kevin Raleigh of Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, and Trevor Baringer of Denver Rescue Mission.  ¬∑ Buy someone a cup of coffee so they have an excuse to hang out in a coffee shop for a few hours and warm up. You can buy $5 McDonald‚Äôs gift cards to hand out if you‚Äôre able.  ¬∑ Distribute hand warmers and socks. These inexpensive items can be lifesavers for people experiencing homelessness. Socks get wet when you‚Äôre homeless. Chronically wet feet deteriorate.  ¬∑ If you own a business, allow people to come inside for a while and warm up.  ¬∑ Offer to walk with or drive someone to a shelter or to the library. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre prepared to engage with people at that level, people will appreciate it,‚Äù Leonard said. Baringer agreed, adding ‚Äúnothing is wasted‚Äù on efforts to help people experiencing homelessness. ‚ÄúIt truly is going saving someone‚Äôs life.‚Äù  ¬∑ Hand out bus passes. Some people have a place where they can stay in cold weather, such as a relative‚Äôs or friend‚Äôs house, but have no way to get there.  ¬∑ A complete listing from Colorado Coalition for the Homeless of ways to help unhoused people during winter can be found here.  Homeless advocacy group demands more  Housekeys Action Network Denver, a homeless advocacy group, issued a press release Friday asking for donations of tents and sleeping bags. Donations can be made to Mutual Aid Monday.  During the Safety, Education, Housing and Homelessness Committee Wednesday, city staff downplayed stories of homeless people being turned away from shelters. According to HAND, the reaction underscored ‚Äúthe complete dismissal of what houseless people themselves are telling them is happening,‚Äù the news release stated. ‚ÄúMany of these incidents were reported and witnessed directly by advocates and the City's own outreach partners and still this reality is denied.‚Äù  According to the HAND news release, ‚ÄúThis committee meeting made it ever more clear that City and community action is needed to try and stop people from suffering and dying this winter. Already this winter it is our understanding at least two people have died on the streets due to exposure to the cold. This cannot be a standard we accept.‚Äù

yz88vh,ix24es4,,In Chattanooga they have made camping on any city property illegal so there is literally no where to sleep.  The DA just evicted and closed down the 3rd budget hotel where those in poverty could live - it is being turned into luxury apts  They have moved shelters off the bus line so it is hard to get there.   They removed all the benches in downtown since they were "problem benches" and homeless slept there.   Don't come to Chattanogoa.
yz88vh,,ix29fwn,Oh shit. That‚Äôs uh‚Ä¶harsh.
yz88vh,,ix4oaus,Yup.   It is really sad. And our homeless population has quadrupled since 2019.   Some tried to create little shanty's with heat but the Mayor shut them down as a fire hazard.  It is really grim here.
yz88vh,ix18vx9,,I know my city has made it a crime to sleep within the city limits. It's a city ticket which means if you don't go to court they won't be able to take you to jail for a failure to appear. But it does give them the opportunity to run your name and question you
yz88vh,,ix24ijs,Hey fellow 423. I just posted.    They also removed the benches and I know you know about Budgetel.
yz88vh,ix1mweo,,Added layers, systematically in-placed over time using countless measures, means, to viciously, without remorse, (likely glee in some cases) increase the difficulties and the suffering of our o fellow countrymen and women, neighbors, our loved ones, ourselves.   Not sure if you can call my city big‚Ä¶but, the State loves to just grind people and use them.  -Recently made lots of changes, Barriers placed to prevent camping.  -Certain shelters already running with improper staffing, supplies, etc now have even less.  -Changes in laws make it more difficult to be homeless‚Ä¶very response from politicians that made this change, direct quote and seems common, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the answer to homelessness is.‚Äù Yeah‚Ä¶and yet you passed legislation about something you, don‚Äôt know?. Like you just clearly admitted that.  -Oh what else, lots of other bs rhetoric passed around about people not wanting to work or idk‚Ä¶just fill in the blank.  -Um one particular candidate that ran for an office, his candidacy straight up spread misinformation about homelessness and even the local police, order,  bought into it and endorsed this candidate.  Almost won too!  -Bus transportation was gutted‚Ä¶then, those needing to ride the bus were specifically targeted and discriminated against locally.  Bud transportation was further gutted back in the summer.  -Lots of local corruption specifically in housing market.  -Excessively poor education system that is funded well enough, but those funds are misspent and the focus has been well off the mark for decades.
yz88vh,ix01wo5,,Literally making us move. Camps get raided, they tell us to move on, we gather up our stuff, but there's no where to go. We can only take what we can carry because whatever you leave behind is getting thrown away. So end up walking with all my stuff in a tarp dragged behind me (they make sure to take the shopping carts as "stolen property") looking for a new spot, all while the cops watch you and tell you everywhere you stop is not allowed. It's a way to punish us for not having anywhere to go. Heads up for anyone thinking about coming to California.
yz88vh,,ix9qseg,Are there no shelter options locally?
yz88vh,iwzslxq,,Closing all public restrooms after 10pm. I remember when I was in Seattle I couldn't find any cheap food or beverage under like $3.  Edit: Also store workers telling us to leave our backpacks at the front when we shop. I never comply with it. I just say "I'm not doing that" and just proceed to shop normally. One time I walked in a 7-Eleven that was doing that. I refused to comply, walked right past the guy at the front register that told me that. Then he called on the other worker that was there. It was some big beefy dude. The big guy walked up to me like he was going physically push me out of the store. Idk if he was actually going to do it though. Since I wasn't being allowed further I just left because some hot chocolate and cookies just is not worth all that.  Edit: Another very notable anti-homeless device that cities love to use; sprinklers.
yz88vh,,ix2bnrq,intimidation tactics are just that - they're not going to open themselves up to be sued if they used physical violence.
yz88vh,,ix2fae7,I think you mean physical force
yz88vh,,ix296zs,Nice! It‚Äôs crazy with how much this type of discrimination consistently gets repeated daily.  Getting real tired of finding the one register open with an actual human to check me out‚Ä¶only to be asked for my proof of purchases near the exit by the‚Ä¶greeter?. Isn‚Äôt that the job title?!   How odd huh?.  Yeah, last time I just said, what?  Then explain I went through a check out, don‚Äôt waste my time or I‚Äôll return this entire cart.
yz88vh,,ixg6btc,> Closing all public restrooms after 10pm. I remember when I was in Seattle I couldn't find any cheap food or beverage under like $3.  Its because junkies go in there, piss and shit all over everything then pass out in a Fenty fold and no one wants to put up with it. Its impossible to find a public toilet anywhere in Seattle because of homeless junkies ruining everything for everyone.   > Also store workers telling us to leave our backpacks at the front when we shop.  Because shoplifting is rampant. Guess who is responsible for virtually all of it?  > I just left because some hot chocolate and cookies just is not worth all that.  Were you planning to steal it?
yz88vh,,ixgt1fy,I don't steal from stores. The hot chocolate and cookies would have been paid for lmao.   As for the public restroom thing. It sucks being out all night. When I have to go I have to go. Pooping in the bushes is not good for anyone. 7-Eleven didn't like it when I took a handful of napkins either.
yz88vh,ix2d6x0,,Jesus what these cities are doing is inhuman. I live in Montr√©al and have several homeless friends (I've been homeless before). As long as homeless people aren't endangering themselves or others they are left alone. They are allowed to sleep in the subway (when open) especially during winter.  Edit: one of my close friends actually sleeps everyday in the same subway, same spot. I pass him on my way to school. While he sleeps he puts out his panning cup near him. People put money in it while he sleeps. Only one time did someone dare to steal it. Other people woke him immediately pointing at the person who took it.

yz88vh,ix3dewc,,this is the opposite of a question i asked and of course it got way more responses because there are way more cities excluding and hurting the homeless rather than helping. :(
yywvyj,iwwt9ga,,I don't think you can buy any hot food with EBT unless I'm mistaken. I think there might be a special type of EBT that allows it but normal EBT/SNAP you can't buy anything hot or ready to eat, even at grocery stores.
yywvyj,,iwwtmuj,In some states you can. Specifically to allow homeless people to eat
yywvyj,,iwwtz4j,That's what I was thinking. I know that in Maine there is some special ebt you can buy hot food and certain non food items with it but you have to qualify for it.
yywvyj,,iwwu9h6,The rules are weird to me. At a grocery store deli, say you want the cooked chicken. You can't buy the hot one, but the exact same one placed in the fridge, you can.
yywvyj,,iwxlhj0,Yeah I bought a bunch of stuff with my ebt one time and it made me pay for a avocado because I grabbed a "ready avocado" but it lets me buy the "ripen later" ones. Also I bought a Celsius energy drink once but it was in the supplement/work out section of a store so I couldn't buy it. But at Walmart that same drink is in energy drink section with like redbulls and monsters and it let me buy it. It's stupid
yywvyj,,ix0a58d,In Florida for the last month we can get any hot food with ebt.
yywvyj,,iwymvlh,If you are homeless they allow it
yywvyj,,iwz0wym,I'm homeless and can't? üòÖ
yywvyj,,ixy73ns,Just tell your worker to put you on the hot food EBT program. I had to tell mine when I was homeless. It's a game changer.
yywvyj,,ixyigbx,I'll try that
yywvyj,,iyfoeh3,Weird, I used to work at a grocery store and people would buy those ready to eat rotiserrie chickens with their EBT cards all the time.
yywvyj,,ixy76l4,You need to tell your worker to add you to hot food program. Tell them you have no way to prepare food. It was a life saver for me, literally
yywvyj,iwxbilz,,Sure.  Depending on what state you are in.  [Here's a nice little article that list 18 different fast food restaurants that let you use SNAP](https://restaurantclicks.com/fast-food-restaurants-accept-ebt-food-stamps/).  Maybe not where YOU are... but somewhere, they do.  [Here's a list of 315 Restaurants in California that accept SNAP](https://icaliforniafoodstamps.com/restaurants-that-take-ebt-in-california/), and their addresses, categorized by county, in California.
yywvyj,iwwtu7b,,Why do you need the app? I noticed using the McDonald's app for the 1 dollar large fry deal, but not wanting to pay via the app, I was offered a code to order in the drive through or something to scan in the store to get the deal
yywvyj,,iwx1am9,So I don't need to stand in line and wait 5-20 minutes for my order to be made.
yywvyj,,iwx2idl,üëç
yywvyj,,iwy4hre,They don't start making your order till you get there anyways.
yywvyj,,ix0tw64,I don't think thats true. I used to work at fast food restaurant and sometimes there would be calls to make an order. The order would be made and then they would come, pay, and pick it up. I think McDonald's is different. I opened the app to get the free big mac, but it seems that it's not made before the customer arrives.
yywvyj,,ix1ziug,Also, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong‚Ä¶do you not get special deals and or points, coupons using the app?  Could be handy if you have to stretch things later.
yywvyj,,ixfno5l,You are right about that but I ordered using the drive through code for the fry deal and paid the employee rather than through the app, so if a place accepted EBT in person but not in app, an EBT recipient could still get the app deals
yywvyj,,ixfyh9q,Ahhh, I am enlightened just a little more. Ty
yywvyj,iwxjs56,,people are saying certain states you can, but it‚Äôs more true for certain counties. and your food stamps have to originate from that county. AND the restaurant has to have the technology to accept EBT. it‚Äôs rare to have a situation where it applies, but it does exist.
yywvyj,iwx5ozj,,You can have food delivered from Amazon with EBT but it‚Äôs really expensive.
yywvyj,,iwxz55h,Amazon fresh isn't bad
yywvyj,,iwxz6pf,Is Walmart not free delivery for EBT?
yywvyj,,iwxzarp,I‚Äôm not sure, I live so close to stores I just walk.
yywvyj,iwxj46c,,Yes but u have to specify that you‚Äôre homeless, make sure they add hot meals to your benefits
yywvyj,iwyc3xe,,No.
yywvyj,iwwtuku,,I don't believe you can buy hot food with EBT unless it's a state emergency. Cold food only.
yywvyj,,iwx5mza,You can! In Arizona most fast food places except food stamps.
yywvyj,,iwx5uwr,I stand corrected. I guess each states different.
yywvyj,,iwx641g,Yep. I moved back here homeless and every fast food place in the rough neighborhoods have big signs saying ‚Äúwe accept EBT‚Äù. It saved me because I could 2 cheap tacos at Jack on the Box a day and not starve.
yywvyj,,ix1zxwn,It‚Äôs okay, this is a corner I practically stand in all day, every day. Your humility is appreciated.  Also, something a Chemistry professor would say from time to time‚Ä¶exception proves the rule.  Or something like that Idk, my memory isn‚Äôt great. Lol.
yywvyj,iwx9aat,,Only certain fast food places in certain states accept EBT, and I don't any will via their apps. That would require a lot of extra, pretty complex coding and backend work to meet local and federal requirements. A lot of grocery stores have only recently begun to allow customers to pay online with EBT.
yywvyj,iwxgt1s,,It all depends on your state.. here in NY you can‚Äôt for hot food unless you go to a bodega then it‚Äôs up to the owners what they sell you
yywvyj,iwzz46m,,I can't even buy hot food at the grocery store with EBT
yywvyj,ix0a8bd,,KFC accept EBT in some states, and florida lets you buy any hot food with ebt until December.   You can order delivery from Publix app with EBT.
yyuxcu,iwwzs0i,,They don't mention that many shelters kick you out for missing their curfew which is often as early as 7pm. Good luck managing that if you have a job. "I can't work late because my homeless shelter will kick me out." Aaaand now your coworkers know you're homeless.
yyuxcu,,iwxp1bm,Boulder CO opens at 5 pm, and there is always a line to get in and not enough beds, so you actually have to be there before 4 on cold nights. They do have emergency weather shelters but just normal ones...it's nearly impossible.  And you can't be there during the day cause they kick you out at 6 or 7 am.
yyuxcu,,iwxxbqg,What do you do from 7am to 5pm?
yyuxcu,,iwy4yi8,Well  Mostly work. Try to avoid doing so. I haven't been homeless for years.
yyuxcu,,iwyf3ga,Shiver
yyuxcu,,iwy6uqi,What do you do?
yyuxcu,,iwy6xg6,Working
yyuxcu,,iwycww7,Uh huhhhhhh. And do you think that people who may need to use a Shermer also don't do that orrrrrrrrr?
yyuxcu,,iwy4pob,[deleted]
yyuxcu,,iwy55ar,I would imagine that's difficult.  Boulder is so small you could trip, slip, or fall into the back of a police car by noon.
yyuxcu,,ix0gavs,It's not the size of Boulder that's the problem. Boulder is full of the wrong kind of liberals. NIMBY (Not in my back yard) territory at its finest. Super rich wanna be hippies who own bicycles more expensive than a lot of cars and think that makes them good people. Sorry about the rant - Boulder bugs the fuck out of me.   Anyone remember the South Park episode from years back where Stan's family moves to San Francisco and everyone is smelling their own farts? That's Boulder in 2022.
yyuxcu,,iwxaks6,Although some may find it too embarrassing to let others know about... co-workers knowing you are homeless can often result in roommate offers.  Not only from those who have the space, but from those who are looking to get a "place of their own"... and that seems to be easier when there are two people paying the bills.
yyuxcu,,iwyvvj2,I have seen a couple of homeless get roommate offers via the volunteer group i help with. In one case a female volunteer took in a male homeless person...and they started a relationship. He got a full time job,making 15 bucks an hour... and several months later they broke up...and he was back on the street. Apparently, he was pretty wasteful w his money, and routinely could/would not pay the 75 bucks a week rent he was being charged. Not long after this he lost his job ..so is back to square one.   I am firmly conviced a lot of homeless folks are just not that intelligent.Maybe undiagnosed mental illness or whatever.
yyuxcu,,iwz9agz,This is‚Ä¶extremely problematic.  When humans are put into stressful situations, their intelligence can effectively be reduced in those situations, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not intelligent or smart or creative or whatever people.  When I started making real money after being a poor kid, I was wasteful with my money too.  It happens.  Don‚Äôt be rude and judgey to people you quite literally don‚Äôt know at all.
yyuxcu,,ix2l5h5,to some of these folks we are the only ones helping them at all. Some are just faces to me, and others you do get to know on some level.
yyuxcu,,ix3uudk,yeah i get it, i work at a shelter.  but you know one facet of them, not everything about them, and it‚Äôs ugly to pretend to be nice and care about them and then smear them on the internet and say they‚Äôre unintelligent and therefore, on some level, deserve what‚Äôs happening to them because of that.
yyuxcu,,iwzt1h9,Are you aware that irresponsibility is not the same as lacking intelligence?  You detailed the actions of an irresponsible person... not someone who lacks intelligence.  For example... narcissism is on the rise in the USA, and across the globe.  Narcissists can be both extremely intelligent, and extremely irresponsible.  These things are not mutually exclusive.  I admit freely that it does not APPEAR to be very intelligent of an individual to BE irresponsible.  That, is just an appearance though.  And we all know, things are not always what they **appear** to be on the surface.  Think of one of the classic stereotypes... the beautiful woman who hides her intelligence, because she has an easier time in life when people think she's just a bimbo.  I'm not saying that this guy wasn't unreasonable.  He was.  I'm saying you only present "evidence" of him being irresponsible.  >I am firmly conviced a lot of homeless folks are just not that intelligent.  See... that statement shows that you are predisposed to believe that many homeless are a certain way.  That you assume a lack of intelligence before initiating any contact.  This is an incorrect way for you to be thinking.  The ONLY thing you can assume about any homeless person... is that they are homeless.  >Maybe undiagnosed mental illness or whatever.  This also shows a certain amount of ignorance on your part... because being intelligent and having a mental illness are ALSO not mutually exclusive.  You can indeed have a mental illness AND be very intelligent at the same time.  Again, with a stereotype... the autistic savant with a fantastic IQ, tons of tics and stimming, and absolutely no social skills; brilliant **and** mentally ill.  So, maybe take a step back an re-evaluate your belief structure in regards to homeless individuals.  You seem to have at least three incorrect assumptions going on here.  You can't assume a lack of responsibility is the same as a lack of intelligence... you can't assume "a lot" of homeless are not intelligent... and you can't assume a mental illness equates to a lack of intelligence.
yyuxcu,,ix0gomj,Well, we are getting one extremely skewed side of this story. What's up with taking someone in and starting a relationship? That's not charity. If it were a man who took in a homeless woman, we'd all be crying assault. This person has "volunteer" flair but they talk like a hateful republican. I don't believe a word of it.
yyuxcu,,ix1ltwd,He's a "volunteer" who thinks "a lot" of homeless aren't intelligent and have some kind of mental illness.    He could be a volunteer firefighter.
yyuxcu,,ix2l0sa,I have been volunteering for almost two years..it has been interesting to say the least. Many homeless folks that I referrred to as not being very intelligent, simply do not think long term. In many cases, yes, irresponsible. I do see these folks on occasion playing lotto...stupid. And some, quite simply, are simply not smart enough to do, or keep a job that pays anything...this is not meant to be a knock on them..I am not smart enough to be a Dr for instance.  And some folks cannot comprehend what it takes to reliably put cans on the shelf at Dollar General, or whatever. These are not bad people, just not very bright, and have no one to help them.
yyuxcu,,ix3w743,Hmm.  So... "a lot" of homeless aren't intelligent, eh?  And now the people who work at places like Dollar General aren't very intelligent either.  This list just gets longer over time, doesn't it?  And not thinking long term is a sign of not being very intelligent?  That's odd.  You have to LEARN how to think long term... you have to LEARN the difference between dreaming and planning.  This is not something that people are born with like a genetic memory.  Chess is a game of thinking and planning moves ahead of your opponent.  Not every INTELLIGENT person can play chess, or even provide a competent game.  A lack of ability to play chess well, is not a sign of a lack of intelligence.  It is a sign that a person lacks SPECIFIC knowledge.  I'm getting the impression you equate intelligence, with what knowledge one has... that if one doesn't KNOW something, this automatically means you classify them into the "stupid" category.  I mean... here you are, saying that people who never learned how to plan ahead properly are not very intelligent... when it is simply a lack of knowing HOW to plan ahead properly.  Homeless people playing the lottery are stupid?  Is that because **everyone** who plays the lottery is stupid, or is it only stupid when homeless people play?  >These are not bad people, just not very bright, and have no one to help them.  Who said they were bad people?  Not me.  But saying "these are not bad people" does **not** give validity to your assertion that they aren't very intelligent... like you thought it would.  You look down on others, and you justify it by lying to yourself about your own benevolence.  You don't acknowledge when you have been wrong.  You are definitely part of the problem.  You've pre-judged all these people you could never possibly know, and you do it with the most specious logic.  I wonder if this is all just projection on your part.

yyuxcu,,iwz920r,the shelter i work at‚Äôs ‚Äúcurfew‚Äù is 7pm (when we serve dinner, really it‚Äôs around 9pm), but we make exceptions for work/family/etc.  i used to work overnights and i really didn‚Äôt care, i always let people in unless they were put out for violence, etc., if they were stupid drunk/high i had to wait til they sobered up enough to not wake up the other guests.
yyuxcu,,ix1o0d5,Thats not true in my experience. I work at a shelter in  nyc the curfew for every shelter in the city is 10pm at the earliest but most places dont even follow that rule unless your gone for days.  And any shelter will give you a work pass if you have a job.
yyuxcu,,ix7grnz,Some will do their best to work with you, sadly some will not. For us as long as you are there before staff leaves at night you're good.
yyuxcu,iwwjyy0,,And some just don't want to be around other f***** up people in the world because there's plenty of yours out there
yyuxcu,iwxp0mj,,We have two shelters here : one for men, and one for women. The women‚Äôs facility also houses women and children affected by domestic violence. The men‚Äôs facility is run by a local religious organization.  As a trans guy, I can‚Äôt use either - the ‚Äúgood Christians‚Äù at the men‚Äôs facility don‚Äôt allow ‚Äúbiological women.‚Äù As someone who presents and passes as male, I cannot stay at the women‚Äôs facility without upsetting some of the other residents. I refuse to put anyone who‚Äôs been through and escaped the hell of DV through anxiety solely by my presence.   The next closest shelter is a 113 mile walk.   Where‚Äôs the choice?
yyuxcu,,ix07zz9,Thank you for your insightful comment!
yyuxcu,iwxgi35,,It‚Äôs funny, where I live there are less than 1000 shelter beds and over 6000 homeless people and people **still** ask why people ‚Äúwon‚Äôt‚Äù go to shelters. There are waiting lists for every shelter and most of them only take people by referral.
yyuxcu,,iwyauma,Across the U.S. there are at least twice as many unhoused people as there are beds. But 40% of us work which makes shelter living not feasible. At least 12% of the unhoused in the U.S. are Autistic that they're better off NOT being in congregate living situations, and who knows what percentage of the unhoused have issues like PTSD or claustrophobia that they can't stay in shelters. And alot of shelters charge people that no one can afford to stay either, especially since shelter restrictions for coming and going don't really allow for people to work while staying there. Where I am, there's shared housing, but it's several times more expensive than GR, and it costs your entire income if you are on disability.
yyuxcu,iwwobrh,,Because sometimes they can't get a room. An excess of rules at the shelter and theft happens a lot at shelters.
yyuxcu,,iwztw0w,yeah like a giant smoking room on the ground floor but no bikes allowed inside.  \[the smoking room would have been perfect to double as a bike room\]  After my handlebar/stem got stolen my fork was not fully attached and i tried to take it in and they told me no cuz it could be used as a weapon. The fork went a couple days later.
yyuxcu,iwx3n4n,,Shelters in cold climates are not warm.  I'm much more warmer in my tent than a shelter.  I'm  very toasty right now.  The guys in the shelters are freezing their balls off
yyuxcu,,iwy17p1,I hate shelters. But I‚Äôll say this isn‚Äôt correct as a blanket statement.  I‚Äôm in Winnipeg  Even the last week has been -3 to -14 Celsius   The shelters are warmer than your tent or broken down car here for like 5-6 months a year  The only exception is if you have a solid heat setup  Like you use your cars heater or you have a heater whether propane or shore power etc  Shelters here are all heated buildings so you‚Äôll be in 15-20 Celsius
yyuxcu,,iwy2e0q,The shelters here have 60 foot ceilings with heaters at the ceilings.  They are freezing.  I'm wrapped up in a 0 degree bag that's tucked inside a -25 degree bag.  I'm toasty my friend.
yyuxcu,,iwy3114,Sheesh sounds like your community is using an oversized building and underpowered heaters lol.  What city?   I‚Äôm just in regular crew socks double socking  Pair of basic Walmart sweats  T shirt, crew neck since they were out of hoodies last time, and a polyester construction jacket that‚Äôs supposed to be part of those two layered (so two jackets) winter ‚Äúsuits‚Äù this is the inside jacket. I‚Äôm also wearing a 5$ toque from dollarama with a liner built in and using a 20$ fleece blanket from Walmart  Did all last year with a blanket that was slightly shittier them the 7$ fleece blankets at Walmart and a 5$ survival blanket   So I‚Äôve been warm all this year when In my back seat. Especially since we haven‚Äôt gone below -15 here yet and only been below -10 a handful of times
yyuxcu,,iwy3bqf,They only part of the city that would allow the shelters was a commercial warehouse district.  So there you have it.
yyuxcu,,iwy4zz5,What city?  But yep that checks out considering the roof height and the fact people are nimbys  Edit: certainly Doubting the validity of this poster considering how incorrect his first blanket statement was not to mention he refuses to give any general information that would confirm or deny it or any useful information.
yyuxcu,,iwxyss8,That makes me mad
yyuxcu,,iwy1ifl,As someone who lives in one of the coldest cities on earth and is homeless. It‚Äôs not right‚Ä¶ at least surely not as a blanket statement  But I doubt there‚Äôs much truth to it at all. Winnipeg has some of the oldest roughest infrastructure in Canada and is known as little Chicago in the film industry because its got the same old architecture and infrastructure.  We also don‚Äôt have as modern or updated buildings here as other main cities and far less federal funding goes to Winnipeg then say, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Vancouver.   But even here I‚Äôve neve heard of a shelter without heat. It‚Äôs pretty much the only good thing guaranteed there.  Shelter and heat.    Maybe this is a us issue I‚Äôm not to up on?
yyuxcu,,iwzq4py,i spent the winter of '19 in Calgary and the three shelters I stayed at were warm, and 2 were fully "wharehouse" style.  :)  \[the DI and Mustard Seed\]  ps - the DI wtf lol    I saw at least 2 female staff members pelted with trays of food,  and  some of the clients were engaged in a serous loogie contest, loogies in all the sinks and fountains.
yyuxcu,iwweogd,,They also didn't mention most shelters disallowed alcohol and even being intoxicated, and some can have a very overwhelming religious atmosphere that can be a huge turn off.
yyuxcu,,iwx3el9,We had that problem in my country, the solution was simple: Make 2 shelters. One for the people that are sober and clean, the other one for people that drink. It works well.
yyuxcu,,iwxbyy9,Wet shelters are making some headway as being seen more in the light of harm reduction rather than enabling. They're pragmatic and they're working. Some people cannot physically quit drinking or using drugs and it would be unsafe for them to try without being in a medical facility.
yyuxcu,,ix0g1ud,I work at a wet shelter, and feel that it's a fair and accepting strategy. We don't require that guests be stone sober, but you have to be able to provide self-care, help with your chores, and not drink/do drugs in shelter. Guests that are sober or have full-time employment have separate accommodations. Most of our guests are very respectful of the rules and happy to not be sleeping outside here in Northeast Wisconsin.
yyuxcu,,iwxsfc2,Was surprised myself to hear that my location had opened one a few years back.  Funded by the more progressive religious and what not.  Not many beds, but hey it‚Äôs a start. You won‚Äôt see volunteers here unless they happen to be licensed social workers.
yyuxcu,,iwxeghz,I‚Äôd rather have all the addicts gathered in one place, opposed to wandering the streets.
yyuxcu,,iwyby9p,I feel it should be the same with housing. I am terrified of ever ending up in some kind of housing meant for unhoused people and getting exposed to meth residue and secondhand drugs. Let the druggies live in the drug exposed units instead of ruining the noncontaminated ones.
yyuxcu,,iwzvbnz,***terrified*** of second hand drugs give me a fucking break
yyuxcu,,ix0don8,You must be a drug addict then.
yyuxcu,,iwzv1wd,In Vancouver BC we all the sudden have a huge backlash against harm reduction.  It is part of a new conservative movement that resembles US neo-cons  Jordan Peterson is their God.
yyuxcu,,ix1yurq,First, i'm in Europe and where i live, we have institutions for that: I think the english term is "safer injection site", but we usually call them "drug consume rooms" in my language. These are rooms, where the addicts can go and do drugs, with surveillance of medical staff. The staff includes a doctor and nurses, having narcan, breathing-machine etc. ready, so if someone would overdose, they could intervene. There was never a single death in history of these rooms.  Anyway, what i wanted to say is that usually, the people use these rooms for doing drugs and then return to the shelters or social housing apartements.
yyuxcu,,iwzurm8,Vancouver BC has similar, but the high barrier shelters you can do your thing outside and come back if you arenet totally out of it, the low ones have  shooting rooms \[but maybe no smoking drugs inside lol\]  Trouble is the low barrier are so hardcore that dabblers dont really fit in.  Also the drug ones all have bike rooms and only one high barrier does wtf,..
yyuxcu,,ix1xks4,I'm in Europe and we have some special systems here, that are maybe not known in the USA; like mobile shelters. These are modified trucks, that have beds and other things like a toilet and a kitchen inside. So, with that you can quickly make more additional space when it is needed, like in winter.  It's not always just about the homeless, like with the war in Ukraine, there were so many refugees coming in February, that we just don't have enough spaces. So, they get sometimes temporary in such barracks.
yyuxcu,,iwzokfj,It‚Äôll be a tough sell considering safety of workers, liability problems if someone OD‚Äôs, etc.
yyuxcu,,ix1xx42,It's a little bit similiar with social housing, we got in my country in Europe and we had to change the approach to it; in the past, they just gave apartements to homeless people without much support. But today, it's different, like these buildings have an office of social workers inside the complex that is open 24/7.   The staff there makes sure, everybody is well and alive. They help with the paperwork, get the homeless places for therapy and recovery, for detox and rehab. They make welfare checks and make sure, nobody is a hoarder etc.  With this close monitoring and help all the time, it's much easier for the people to get off the street and stay off the street in long term.
yyuxcu,,ix08a9h,When I used to stay at the Salvation Army Crossroads shelter in Denver in 2019 many people were constantly drunk and also drinking in the shelter, they even had a "wet side" and a "dry side"
yyuxcu,,iwwwu0g,A rule for not being intoxicated makes total perfect sense.
yyuxcu,,iwx09qg,I get the reason of course, yet it's a huge barrier for many.
yyuxcu,,iwxpqa1,Not necessarily.  Many hard-core alcohol addicts can have a BAC of well over the legal limit and that is their baseline and you'd never know they were drinking. Also, it's not fair to just have alcohol be the barrier to entry but you could still have people on heroin, meth, etc come in with no one the wiser.
yyuxcu,,ix2qosv,They shouldn't be drinking and I feel sorry for them.
yyuxcu,,ix3zosa,No one should be drinking, really. But many alcoholics can't stop drinking cold turkey because it will quite literally kill them.
yyuxcu,,iwzu9vs,Most staff dont understrand ptsd at all and think you are being the ultimate Karen when triggered.  I agree it looks like that, but they should be trained to identify ptsd.
yyuxcu,,ix0ry94,Yes of course, and I am speaking as an individual who has both started in and worked at a shelter the level of training provided is inadequate and the quality of individuals who can make it long term have developed a deep compassion fatigue
yyuxcu,iwx6d2u,,With Covid our local shelter switched to tiny pallet houses. I know one guy who is claustrophobic and cant stand being in a tiny space, especially with a stranger.
yyuxcu,,iwxtkfl,Tiny and with stranger?! Yeah, nah‚Ä¶pass. My battle buddy and I struggled in 120sqft, (pretty large for Army Standards I think) with our wall lockers in the middle for‚Äòsome‚Äô sense of privacy.  Really need to check in with him soon.
yyuxcu,iwy7vaq,,The times I've tried the shelter was always some nonsense they had a six or 7:00 p.m. curfew, you couldn't bring too many items in my case all I had was a backpack with an extra pair of jeans and three underwears in it, theft was rampant, or other homeless folks will try to bully you, security was non-existent in certain places.   If you had a car and they found out about it they would give you a hard time.   There are some shelters where the staff abused the hell out of you I was at one place briefly where the females got to go to rooms where they had cots and stuff but I suspected that they were being abused, and the males were forced to sleep on basically a glorified basement floor with rats scurrying around.   The shelter system is a joke if whoever funds them doesn't actually monitor what these not for profits do with the money. I remember one Thanksgiving Day they were trying to serve us turkeys and the food was spoiled like the taste and  everything was spoiled and anybody who said anything was basically threatened with eviction or ejection.   Another shelter I was at this time I was working as a janitor there and still l living in my car that had supervisor basically expected some sort of bribe in order for them to do anything for you I mean he didn't outright say it but you can tell.    One shelter I stayed at they wanted us to put our backpacks in a secure room some people cooperated and then the next morning they're throwing our backpacks in the dumpster and threatening us with police if we went and got our backpacks. I got my backpack anyway.
yyuxcu,iwz8bwp,,I never used shelters. The many times I've been homeless I've also had jobs (sometimes multiple) and the curfews/line-ups/bed vouchers were too much to deal with when all I wanted was a place to sleep between shifts. Or somewhere to relax on days off so I wasn't just spending all day in a library or meandering a mall. Much easier to find a park and string up a hammock or in winter buy a tent, sleeping bag, and portable battery heater. If I'm getting kicked out at 8am and can't return until 8pm; might as well not even be there at all. Not every job is 9-5.
yyuxcu,,ix07g3r,Thanks for sharing your story!
yyuxcu,iwwkjc4,,Have a boyfriend and a cat. Plus just eating dinner at the local shelter had me being harassed by the male volunteers, I'd rather not get assaulted or something.  Having been in this situation for years has basically killed my trust in most things.
yyuxcu,,iwwx3ft,I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. I believe you and I hope you are safe now.
yyuxcu,,iwx0u6i,Thank you. I didn't mean to make it sound worse than what it was, but I did have several men show interest, and at least one treated me badly once I declined his advances.  I mean, I don't mind if people "shoot their shot" so to speak, but you have to accept no as an answer and don't take it out on me for turning you down!  I'm picky anyway, the man I'm with is the first and only man I've ever been with, and I was 31 when we started seeing each other. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
yyuxcu,,iwwt6yj,This is fake. Nobody ever messed with you. Ever. Liar!
yyuxcu,,iwy94so,What the fuck is wrong with you?
yyuxcu,,iwzw2lw,its a Moron, part of a league of Morons.  damn I need to make that John Malchovich hammer attack gif.
yyuxcu,,iwwwial,...ok then.
yyuxcu,,iwxmmd2,How would you know
yyuxcu,,iwxdfen,Shut up dumbass
yyuxcu,,iwzvw9k,nice comment history you mother fucking moron.
yyuxcu,iwzstyj,,Let's see drugs,bugs, bedtimes,sleeping with one eye open so you wake up with your few meager belongings,sleeping in a room full of strangers that are messed up(either mentally,physically,addictions/emotionally)I can Barely sleep in a room of people I know let alone strangers..than there's also violence, bad smells,and sickness being more easily spread around...oh and Most won't take pets either.   In all my yrs homeless I stayed in a youth shelter Once(I was too old but all my friends weren't) they took in animals,you were allowed to go smoke,barely anybody there(like maybe 30 youths and I knew most everyone) and it was a terrible non stop rainy winters night...that one was cool but was only 3/ nights/week and changed spots everyday but We got a bed roll on the floor,could set up wherever,table of snacks out at night and get woken up at 8 am to breakfast.  That was an alright shelter. The adult ones I walked in,walked out and went and grabbed a bunch of cardboardü§£
yyuxcu,,ix07br1,Thanks for commenting!
yyuxcu,iwzy96p,,Being in a hotel room right before covid hit was a godsend to me, they were putting all the homeless into them. Got put in by Social Services. Now I'm about to complete my Associates. Wouldn't have happened if they hadn't let me stay. Having a hotel room at least allows me to have dignity and a place to call my own. Prior to that it was rough sleeping under a tarp is winter. Where I live there are no shelters for women. There's two for men, and one for families. It's really weird.
yyuxcu,,ix072pu,Thank you for taking the time to comment. I am so glad it worked out for you!
yyuxcu,iwzwyad,,Homeless in Denver here. I can summarize most of what was written here and add to it. The problem with most of the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in this city is that it doesn't respect and empower the agency of the person it's allegedly trying to help. Help that doesn't respect agency, a core aspect of what it means to be a person, isn't help. It's control and abuse. We recognize that in family and romantic relationships when it occurs ‚Äî but as soon as it happens on a public scale, we tune it out for some reason. This city doesn't treat homeless people like people. It treats us like children it has to be a parent to, or like house plants that you just have to throw food, water, and basic shelter at to live. But no person can live off that. When people are getting more of what they need as people off the streets than at shelters and other resources, it might be time to pause and reflect.
yyuxcu,,ix07636,Thank you for your insight!
yyuxcu,iwx2vaj,,nore upvotes are needed. you hang in there and all these issues that stress us we can all survive as they are temporary issues, and times. i bleieve in you and you must, you must leave the voilence, their raging parents any rage any hrurt any abuse. leave with the clothes on your back. you wont want the old assets in those old places, let them all go. its a truama bonds tehtering you to what which hilds you  down and holds you back. i believe in you, your choices matter and they have outcomes. are you ok today?
yyuxcu,iwxo9ws,,While I was homeless it was next to none that I would get into the shelter for the night. I slept wherever I could. They stay full anymore.
yyuxcu,iwy25hb,,All I know is right now I am freezing and barely hanging on
yyuxcu,iwyaj1v,,"Choose to shiver"? I am high risk for COVID, and I have disabilities which prevent me from living with other people because they would be seriously exacerbated and cause my mental and physical health to decline. When I did have work and attend classes, shelter schedules wouldn't have allowed me to do either. There is no way in hell I will stay in a shelter. I actually need to live alone as a disability accomodation.
yyuxcu,iwwk9qn,,And maybe just maybe some of us still have a little prize left Foolish Pride although but Pride it is
yyuxcu,iwx8vi5,,Funny how they know why homeless don't shelter without actually talking to any homeless people.
yyuxcu,,iwzwaac,or they find some poor bashing youtube doc that pics the homeless people they want you to hear.
yyuxcu,ix0i1j1,,Let's talk about the abuse by shelter staff.. They bully us, take our personal stuff and steal our money.  They also endanger our lives by not honoring medical documentation. I have been threatened with seizure of my medicine. I am a diabetic and if I don't have my medical and a snack I die.  Let's talk about the lack of rules and fair application of those rules. Each shift leaderca.n apply their own rules. They still money homeless get so they can go home to see a dying relative.   Interfaith is guilty of all this. I don't care if they see this. People need to know the real reality of homeless in the us.
yyuxcu,ix1ngz7,,As somebody who has lived and the  worked in nyc shelters for the past 5 years i can tell you without a doubt  its either because of a mental health issue or because they are a drug addict. Despite what you may belive homeless shelters are really not that bad. Manybplaces in new york give you a private room with 3 meals a day. They have counselor and shit too help you every step of the way from getting you documentation, then benefits and vouchers that will pay your rent up to 2 grand  a month for 2+ years. But if you live in a shelter you have rules and a curfew and that doesn't jive well if your an addict.
yyuxcu,,ix24irf,Actually, very few places give you a private room. Usually it is a room shared with another guy. And the food is terrible.
yyuxcu,,iytosfk,So youre complaining about free room and board plus free food in favor of sleeping outside in the cold because the free food isn't good and you don't want a roommate? Sounds like somebody on drugs to me.
yyuxcu,iwwipnh,,Too many rules
yyuxcu,,iwx1omm,learning which is "how to live and how to feel ease with pple that control my access to whatever."  words about words for ages 16 to 30. shelter try hard and their efforts are immense its just more complicated that pple wanting to drink. i need the nightlight for my art. i try to expalin how the art follows me and i follow art it matters from 12a, to 5am. it matters how the trees look against the mooklight. its stuff i live for. now i understand on locking the doors its just that i stand from pain and then sometimes im in bed. their rules make rest impostible but dont tell anyone i said all this. im just trying to sort thru why I should go back to the shelter. its nice pple but no food and i didnt eat well or much again. its stressing me. and i fixed the truck, tried to swim and Lift to get some ADLs and art done. norman arts wnats my artwork. i had to tell them. please hepl me im homeless. the shame never ends. right now im adjusting to expensive food I cant afford. the shlters are not bad its just the are starts to smell bad. then im akwane by s dude shouting. thats called not ahppeening to me again. i cannot handle a guy yelling or really even speaking. now thats sounds extreme, its not. its truama talking. i left two fucking holding tanks OKC stayle over being poor and homeeless, they mak a person a fucking criminal. im sorry im all over the place. the rules there spun my mind. reminded me of willows they had rules per each person then they changed the rules. but, important to say please go in the shelter for warmth dont get hurt or freeze i dont like how my homelessness is but its  a experienece i caerry and walk with. my art walks with me that all that matters. wellness, given
yyuxcu,iwx0v6o,,too many pple with too many needs with too many words. its just too much to sort thru. deep drain.
yyuxcu,iwwf9ht,,Simple as some just don‚Äôt wanna deal with rules and regulations.
yyuxcu,,iwwqe0e,This is ignorant though. And how society labels us because we don‚Äôt follow a failing poorly set up system for societal reintegration.   If you have stuff, you will likely leave without it when you leave the shelter. It will be stolen  If you aren‚Äôt religious they still shove religions down your throat at many of them because churches don‚Äôt do anything a lot of the week so they end up being available to help with this. Some are very pushy.  The threat of bedbugs or disease is very real.   If you are just down on your luck or depressed or along those lines, and are sane you will mostly be surrounded by unstable less sane people and criminals.  Some of us have lived the hardest lives of anyone still on planet earth, and yet we will get denied shelter for simply smoking a joint with 3 other people or having a beer before you come back. If you privileged homed people who are much better off can indulge there‚Äôs no real reason homeless should be denied EMERGENCY SHELTER because they smoked a bit of weed or drank a few beers providing they don‚Äôt behave erratically on them and put the other shelter members in danger. And for some shelters those are the ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù rules  People are going through hell and don‚Äôt want their last piece of sanity or freedom or independence stripped from them to live in a big infested crime hotspot shelter where some magic all powerful deity in the sky is shoved down your throat about how great he is well you live in hell and squalor.  Cut people a break and have some compassion please lol
yyuxcu,,iwwq4gq,Many are addicts that would need a medical detox before they would be safe to quit the alcohol or drugs. Detoxing is ugly and painful. And in the cases of alcohol and benzos, quitting cold turkey kills a lot of people. To view this as something that simple just shows how detached you are from any realities that the homeless face.
yyuxcu,ixcieu7,,I was able to get into a shelter right before hurricane Ian. My experience was not great and the shelter was only helpful for food, bed and a roof. They had strict rules and I felt like the center would talk down to me. I left about a week ago. I feel happier. Shelters work for some people but not this guy.
