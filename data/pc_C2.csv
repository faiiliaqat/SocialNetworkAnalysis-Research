o7pzgm,h308b93,,Looks good, where‚Äôs the drink?
o7pzgm,,h309ydz,Nothing beats a jug of water hanging behind a strap on my backpack.
o7pzgm,h31ff57,,My daily was always hummus and chips, with avocado, salt, and a lemon. Whatever of the lemon I don't squeeze on the avo goes in the water.  Vegan bums represent
o7pzgm,,h31fl0f,A couple of crust punk train hoppers I was recently with up in Seattle  heavily relied on humus and pita bread.  So delicious.
o7pzgm,,h31fvcx,I still eat that shit all the time Even though I got a kitchen in my rig and I'm more clever these days, it's such an easy filling protein source
o7pzgm,,h31g6aa,May have to create a sign later "anyone got hummus?"   I'm craving that shit now. Damnet.
o7pzgm,,h31hzbt,You know how to get urs! Plus the shit stays good longer than almost any other food I've carried (for something that's supposed to be refrigerated anyway)  Enjoy homie!
o7pzgm,,h31i1lp,My man.
o7pzgm,,h32jptx,U get u some or what!?
o7pzgm,h30xr0r,,Probably the healthiest food for your body, bar none.
o7pzgm,h30ulqp,,Can't stand the sardines. Tuna is still the way to go for me. Mix it with packets of mayo and relish and I could grab crackers from store salad bars. Tuna salad for 89¬¢ - $1
o7pzgm,,h311tf8,Sardines was definitely not my first choice. But, I couldn't pass up a discount. Lol
o7pzgm,,h313upp,Ya do what ya gotta. In the end I'd probably lose most of the meat picking around the bones
o7pzgm,,h313z1v,These were already deboned! Haha
o7pzgm,,h3147lr,I might be down to eat them then. My taste buds are fucked, anything stinky and fishy and I'm good.
o7pzgm,,h348vgn,Tuna is very high in mercury. Doesn‚Äôt meant mean don‚Äôt enjoy, but best not eat more than  once a week probably. Sardines are small, so they don‚Äôt have the longevity of accumulating toxins in their tiny bodies.
o7pzgm,h31pvcs,,Hey any Meat while being homeless is a good idea l like tinned fish because it a better compromise then processed  meat and food
o7pzgm,h33g6yl,,I swear I was just about to post something about sardines myself!  The overall health benefits compared to any other canned meets are unmeasurable.  I remember years ago after going crazy from Mal nutrition, eating nothing but dry ramen and potted meet for longer then I‚Äôd like to admit.  I would remember to eat a few cans of fish.
o7pzgm,h30k2mt,,What's it like out there?
o7pzgm,,h31118h,Absolutely gorgeous.
o7pzgm,,h30saog,[deleted]
o7pzgm,,h31169h,Beautiful is the only word that describes Astoria.  I'm hanging out underneath a tree, enjoying the shade, and the beautiful pacific ocean coast.

o56373,h2lxeak,,I'm so happy to hear this news. Thank you for sharing dear friend.
o56373,h2odsq4,,That is awesome. Not to assume anything but please, please, please use this gift soberly and wisely. Don‚Äôt waste it or make your friend regret it.
o56373,,h3qixw7,Yes! Op is probably already doing this but doing things around the house (cooking dinner, keeping things tidy) will go a long way!
o56373,h2m6106,,That‚Äôs so wonderful! Happy you‚Äôre in a safe place and have such a lovely friend!!
o56373,h2o82gf,,Gotta love how the Universe works
o56373,h2o7ptt,,Wow that's amazing! Congrats. Im sure that takes a lot of stress off your shoulders. That's a great friend you have there.
o56373,h2p5mb9,,Awesome! Glad to hear that things are going well for you at the moment!
o56373,h2l6jnr,,Providence: 1a often capitalized : divine guidance or care b capitalized : God conceived as the power sustaining and guiding human destiny 2 : the quality or state of being provident  ‚ÄúUntil one is committed there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initative or creation, there is one elementary truth...that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves. too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would otherwise never have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in ones's favor all manner of incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man would have believed would have come his way.   Whatever you think you can do or believe you can do, begin it. Action has magic, grace, and power in it.‚Äù  **W.H. Murray The Scottish Himalayan Expedition**
o56373,h4yxaca,,That's awesome! Also, I've gotta respect the Titanfall 2
o56373,h2ohyfv,,Yeah fuck that.... Worst idea... I bet he just keep you make them feel better. Hopefully they late you stay long for you get a place and not kick out for human needs

o4kjrx,h2hyciu,,Where is that?
o4kjrx,,h2hz6ad,Nowhere in particular. I live in CO. headed west maybe 5 miles last Idaho Springs. It's like exit number 210 I think, off of I 70 west. Not entirely accurate but yeah. sorry lol am drunk
o4kjrx,h2jrpgn,,Make sure to wear bug spray!
o4kjrx,,h2js5n5,I can't stand the chemicals honestly, plus the smoke helps keep most of them away.
o4kjrx,,h2jsfty,That's true! But better to deal with the bug spray smell than to accidentally get West Nile virus in Colorado!
o4kjrx,,h2jytin,West Nile Virus, never heard of it before. I'll spend some time on google.

o4kjrx,h2kelbw,,Living the dream!
o4kjrx,h2kfxnp,,Congrats on the new job!!!! Looks like a nice spot you got there!
o4kjrx,h2ijavc,,Gonna sound preachy and stupid....  But please practice fire safety. Avoid setting fire to your surroundings please.
o4kjrx,,h2jgpwu,I cleared all the brush around my fire spot and set it next to the water so I could kick it in when I was finished. Always practice spacial awareness. I appreciate the concern, mother nature is a MILF
o46pn1,h2fsw21,,I‚Äôm happy for you and your gratitude is an important component to healing. Best of luck as you keep moving forward and high five to your lil bro.

o370t0,h2adpay,,That looks like a nice hideaway.
o370t0,,h2ar5cm,agreed
o370t0,h2at1ud,,cool in the summer and out of sight, yeah that a hella nice hideaway.  Kinda like a pirate hideout, albeit no ship and no sea.
o370t0,h2cjzmk,,That looks really comfy!
o370t0,h2az5bi,,How did you not freeze?
o370t0,,h2b4llz,Bridges soak up the suns heat all day then re radiate it underneath at  night. So it stays warmer longer under there. You can put your hand up and touch the dement and its warm way past midnight.  On hot days the cement keeps it cooler underneath too, well into the heat of the day.
o370t0,,h2bduh9,i have insomnia so even with that i wouldn't be able to sleep
o370t0,,h2bvriq,But we slept. Eventually, the mind has to sleep. Even if its light and restless.   Different kind of sleep patterns 'out there', living 'wild'.  Not scheduled, like 'normal' civilization. Not deep and relaxed, not recuperative. Imagine prey animals where they sleep, any moment a predator can creep up, so they develop a sleep mode thats right on the edge of awareness, the slightest warning and they are alert, tuned.  I remember being eventually adapted to a sleep of twenty minutes, like what they call cat napping, for instance. Any time day or night you go into 'rest' mode for a bit, to get refreshed. Then all of a sudden one night you sleep deeply, comfortable the whole night thru, to make up for periods of deprivation.
o370t0,,h2ckvwi,During winter ?? I think I still frozen....
o370t0,h2cnqu1,,Where is this
o2a7no,h25d1it,,You're still a human, like us all. Don't let these labels define you unless you want them to or they benefit you, otherwise they're just words.
o2a7no,,h25d6il,Thank you. It‚Äôs the labels that get me every time
o2a7no,,h25l5ms,Labels are societal constructs meant to build an invisible social heirarchy. You were enlisted, youre still alive and fighting, you may not feel like it but if anything you're more human than most of the assholes I meet in a day. Keep your chin up, the next turn is right around the corner. And also I bet there's some amazing resources on reddit to help you find and secure a job jsyk. Best of luck brother.
o2a7no,,h25qw8k,Let the ‚Äúlabels‚Äù help you right now. These designations come with some perks of assistance; they do not define who you are.   You are being secretly assisted by the universe. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is clear that lots of ways we have been doing life is wrong and counter to life and happiness.   Find out all that is available to you now that you wouldn‚Äôt normally qualify for. Check with the VA. The VASH program has lots of help and good people. You can get a peer support person who will hook you up with many different kinds of support. Disability may qualify you for a yearly clothing allowance, one thing you could check.   Have you looked into getting your VA rating upgrades? Disability Pension has saved my ass more than once and kept me off the street. I was homeless in my car and in shelters until I was housed by VASH.   If you can work, wonderful, but don‚Äôt let the benefits you earned with your Service fall by the wayside out of shame, false pride, or buying into the idea that you are somehow a less valuable person than others. It‚Äôs plain not true.  GOOD LUCK‚ÄîGET TO IT!
o2a7no,,h25xbyy,>Let the ‚Äúlabels‚Äù help you right now. These designations come with some perks of assistance; they do not define who you are.  Exactly what I came to say! Use them to your advantage when you can and when you can't forget about them. They may describe your situation but they don't define you as a person.
o2a7no,,h26jio9,‚òùÔ∏èYes. This!
o2a7no,h25vd4m,,Bro, want me to help you fill it out? All these people saying inspirational words but it don't really help. Lmk we can't communicate over text
o2a7no,,h261t2d,This is so sweet
o2a7no,h25g6li,,I'm very sorry.  Only you get to define you.  Who you are is much deeper than that label.  But if it opens a door for you, really, go for it and use it to its full advantage.  Life's tough and we rarely are provided opportunities.
o2a7no,h25q4kp,,It opens a lot of priority for housing.  My SO works in a residential home for homeless veterans in Massachusetts.  There's a number of them around here.
o2a7no,h26db75,,Use those labels to get whatever you can to make life better for now and then refuse to let become your "calling". That's what they're there for
o2a7no,h27tl26,,Please let me know if you would like me to send you a new, high quality, Klymit camping mat. It stops heat sink, it is waterproof and lightweight and small. If you give me a mailing address I can get it out today.
o2a7no,h28a8vm,,It‚Äôs horrific to me that these three words can ever be used to describe anyone. Proof positive that we have failed as a society
o2a7no,h28pj13,,The words homeless and combat veteran should not be in the same sentence in any healthy functioning civilization.  Hang in there brother, things will get better for u.  It's just another day in the USA.
o0fxmp,h1vabfk,,Damn, can I say that maybe your girlfriend and friends aren‚Äôt actually all that good. Of course there is no way of me knowing, but to leave you hanging like this is just disgusting.   Your mental health needs to come first. If they aren‚Äôt any help to you or your situation, then leave them behind.   Focus on the next 68 days. You‚Äôll make it. It will be tough but you can do it. Go ask a church for help. Go to a mall with an indoor parking lot and park your car in there. Leave it there, move it often and when the time comes just pay the full price of a lost parking ticket.   Best of luck. Cut off people who aren‚Äôt going to help you because a significant other or friends who don‚Äôt have your well-being in there mind are a lost cause.
o0fxmp,h1uy8st,,Not sure where you live, but it is possible that a shelter or church will let you park there. try www.AuntBertha.com (the 211 database but you can search all day if you want). I recently found a shelter with a parking lot for residents.  Good luck!
o0fxmp,h1vf3en,,Dude buy a 40 dollar tent at walmart, find somewhere hidden from everyone, a gas stove and portable charger. Sell the car and get a motel and a moped. Trust me you'll be fine, just keep yourself entertained and stick to beers at night if anything. Try to get disability. It is stressful but once you get used to it it becomes peaceful. If you have money you don't have to steal, and drugs will prolong the shit out of this process
o0fxmp,,h1wbogb,[deleted]
o0fxmp,h1vf3wz,,I can relate. My family kept bombarding me with texts about an address so they can send a holiday outfits for my toddler. When explaining to my sibling how annoying that is because we were living out of our car she just lol'd and said I guess, hope it works and have fun. And for those who think oooh free clothes don't be so ungrateful, my daughter has all the clothes she needs. What she needs is a roof over her head. I'm not begging people to let me use their address for outfits because my family thinks I have the luxury to sit around and do photoshoots for them. I'm busting my ass off trying to get her stability. This is exactly why I try not to associate with my family. Because when all our hard work finally catches a lucky break they'll be calling nonstop for money for wine and drugs and rent that's unpaid because of wine and drugs. Oh and holiday outfits that only get one day of wear. Yet when we're struggling we can't even get EMPATHY. Seriously that's literally all we ask of them.   OP I agree with another commenter that your mental health comes first. You can't dig yourself out if you're busy fighting off people like that. 9/10 those people are the ones rooting for you to fail. Be wary of shelters and if you can find a cheap long term airbnb, go that route. That's how we finally got out of living in our car.
o0fxmp,h1v2139,,Do any of your friends have a license? See if someone can move your car for you.
o0fxmp,h1v0zbs,,Get thru the next 68 days, that‚Äôs your goal if that‚Äôs when ur lease starts. One day at a time til then, u can def easily do that when you‚Äôve done it nearly a year already. Hang in there. Ask know others gf/etc for support.
o0fxmp,h1v17p9,,You can do it.
o0fxmp,h1v2fm4,,May be see if a friend can help you in driving from place to place where your doesn't get taken/towed away and make sure that you have a roof over your head. Taking care of your health is of utmost important too. Eat well and get some good rest. Good luck for the next 68 days.
o0fxmp,h1v46o2,,Sell the car to a friend. Someone might let you stay in it on their property.
o0fxmp,h1vo394,,Are there any good options for stealth camping where you are? Couldn't you also have a friend periodically move your car around every day? Sounds to me like it would be worth it to just keep driving it yourself since you only have to last 68 more days. What are they going to do take your license away?
o0fxmp,h1v7n8o,,Im not american but look for ways to use your disability in your favour.
o0fxmp,h1uyae3,,I sleep next to a dumpster every night and I don‚Äôt have a pillow. The nights are cold and sometimes it rains. I sleep with a loaded gun on my chest because the dumpster is behind my job‚Äôs building. You having a car is a privilege not all of us can share. Without your car, you will do fine. Never give up friend.
o0fxmp,,h1v8esg,you seem to be living the good life....all i have is a machete and sleep in an alleyway.
o0fxmp,,h1wdswq,Damn lol, but do u have a pillow?
o0fxmp,,h1wf85h,I do...I was jesting. My user name should give you a clue  Edut: because competition in misery between homeless people is ridiculous
o0fxmp,,h1yd3bc,I was being sarcastic about the pillow
o0fxmp,h1uwmin,,That sounds horrible, good luck <3
o0fxmp,h1ydlig,,Hold up. You can get and keep a license if you have epilepsy. You say you have health insurance. If you need meds take them. Yes its stressful but you can do this.
o0fxmp,h1vf6ng,,I don't understand why losing your license automatically leads to losing your car. Just move your car.
o0fxmp,h1vhijr,,You live in your car and may be about to lose it?  Of course that's stressful.
o0fxmp,h1wnnk9,,I am so sorry. That sucks. All you need to do is survive the next 68 days. When I was homeless I treated it like man vs wild, I made a game out of it in my head to cope. Putting the puzzle pieces together every day: how much change did I have, where could I go for a shower, where does the next meal come from, is it hot or cold, can I get extra and save up, what surface am I sleeping on tonight, what‚Äôs the weather gonna be, all puzzle pieces. It was exhausting g but it helped me confront my situation and tackle it to think of it like a game, helped me not get sucked into misery. 68 days is very doable. It‚Äôs gonna feel like a long time, and it is in some respects, but it‚Äôs also not, everything is relative. You can survive 68 days. You absolutely can, I have zero doubt in my mind. You got this.
o0fxmp,h1wz4go,,Just have someone come and move your car for you. How bad is the epilepsy? I would just drive and say screw it. Your all good as long as you don‚Äôt get pulled over. You can make it 68 days my guy. You got this.
o0fxmp,h1x082s,,do you get seizures when you drive? i'm not following just move the car during the day to avoid the bright lights - you should be fine. Also if you have a girlfriend or a friend you wouldn't be burdening them - you said you have a lease in 68 days just chip them 10 bucks a week or something.
o0fxmp,h1v28s3,,sending love your way, best of luck!
o0fxmp,h1w6ufj,,Can you have someone move the car for you
o0fxmp,h21va80,,Well they may not be enthused, but dang could we be a little inconvenienced here. Everybody together could give you each a week at least. Another thing is if they have a house, to live in your car on the property.
o0fxmp,h3wkvme,,Best wishes my dude. I totally get how stressful the threat of having nothing can be. Hopefully something comes up to give you a little more time.
o0mqz9,h1vwocr,,I been homeless in summer and winter and I'd rather be freezing. Much love man find some water
o0mqz9,,h1x1ed3,I need to find the closest likker store.
o0mqz9,,h1y4pgn,That too
o0mqz9,h1xrj20,,Ughhh mosquitos are the shittiest. Hang in there dude. Been there, done that.
o0mqz9,,h20tbzl,This was at the catch out in Fort Worth, you know my pain bro lol.
o0mqz9,,h20uivt,I fucking knew it was Fort Worth.  I'll never go the stockyards ever again during the summer due to the humidity and mosquitos. Fuck that shit. God speed.  Come up to Washington.
o0mqz9,h1vwref,,OD green is my favorite color
o0mqz9,h28uyjc,,I hear sage is a natural mosquito repellent. People selling sage in my town generally have hearts and are willing to help out(witchy/pagan)

o0mqz9,h1ywdl7,,Buy a hat with a mosquito veil. It makes a huge difference
o02ppv,h1t8mkk,,I'm in a [Do Good](https://dogoodmultnomah.org/) motel shelter, been here almost a year.  Yeah I know, I won the homeless lottery!
o02ppv,,h1t9ckm,Before I get quizzed, it's a private room, in a clean motel 6.    The structure is like a college dorm room. Just check in daily so they know I'm not dead in my room or MIA. Non smoking rooms, but the smoking area is 420 friendly.    Bi weekly laundry, clothing closet, food pantry.   All they care about is getting people who can be housed into housing.   You gotta do some seriously dumb shit, or be regularly disruptive to get bounced.
o02ppv,,h1trfn3,This should be the model for most shelters. This actually seems to cater to the vast majority of the homeless population.  People don't realize the junkies need their own model of services, the felons need a completely different one, the severely mentally Ill schizophrenic needs treatment either in the community or otherwise, we (The vast majority and there are millions of different issues in our own demographic) sure as hell need a whole different model of support, which is non-existent. I don't think the current model helps any demographics because they're all based on stigma from people in suits that we're so dysfunctional that we shit on the floor by the toilet when we're let into a restroom due to being strung out on heroin or something and not reality.  In exchange, nobody is given individualized support, except for the stereotype who is a junkie drug addict strung out on heroin shitting on the floor, since that is what the service are designed for, obviously the minority.   The "functional", I prefer "invisible" because we're completely invisible to services if we aren't screaming at a wall, assaulting people randomly, or passed out in front of a homeless shelter from a heroin OD during the day when it kicks you out. There's nothing for us.  I don't even think think the population that the services are designed for are being helped.
o02ppv,,h22f0fz,These different categories \*really\* need to be part of the conversations!!!  Thanks for explaining them so well.
o02ppv,,h22gwth,The two most rapidly growing demographics of people becoming homeless are young adults often fleeing domestic abuse or having disability and forced to live without income as the SSDI process takes 3-4 years. Homeless college students are a large demographic ignored with 19% of community college students in LA being considered homeless.  Another growing demographic is the elderly, who is often disabled, who can't afford an apartment on SSI so they end up evicted without support.  Now current system isn't designed for either of those populations. A lot of the young adults have trauma issues and the services and dehumanization or safety issues associated with them re-traumatize them and they end up traumatized by seeking help, because throwing a bunch of collage aged kids or people with disabilities into a conjugate shelter in an open gym where 60% of the population are felons released from prison as a condition of their parole, there are people screaming all night, stringent rules and verbal abuse by staff who treat you worse than a prison inmate, and everyone is trying to rob, steal your stuff, harass or even subject you to violence doesn't help them.  A lot of the young adults have either trauma issues or mental illness, just less severity of someone screaming at the wall, and not to a point where they can't advocate for themselves or are screaming at random people or wandering around aimlessly talking to themselves. Often putting someone with PTSD, depression or anxiety into those environments makes it worse.  I've found that the best approach for that population and what they want most is to have their dignity, autonomy and independence respected because it's all they have and just be treated like a human. No services provide that. That's a big reason why I refuse temporary "housing", because my issue is disability and being stuck in the 3-4 year SSDI process and I usually just feel like I'm punished with jaillike and abusive conditions for being disabled and it makes my depression worse, keeping in mind you're often paying for conditions with rules such as a 10pm bedtime and a curfew in an environment that lacks wifi, where coffee is considered contraband and staff does room searches looking for instant coffee packets, you have bags searched upon entering. That doesn't help my mental health making me feel like I'm in jail and just makes it worse. This is what "temporary" housing which doesn't end up being so temporary consists of for example, because there's not a lot of paths to permanent hosuing. Now the average elderly person doesn't want to be treated in an infantilizing manner either, so the two rapidly growing demographic don't actually get support since there's too much focus on certain populations that are the hardest and need to be in a different system. You can't have a system that supports the mentally Ill and felons, and have it work for both of them, because they both have different needs.  We're fully grown adults that have been successfully surviving living on the street, not criminals or children. If I wanted to go to jail, I have that option without paying for it.  That's why services are inadequate for a large portion of the population.
o02ppv,,h3sqe9q,This is all entirely reasonable and obvious to anyone who lives here.  What I can't for the life of me understand is why proposals like Matt's are somehow just not implemented.  What you describe does sound abusive and dehumanizing. That's not going to help anyone.    How is that so hard to understand?  I mean, who are these people running these programs and why are these obvious flaws perpetuated?  You're not the first person to point all this out, how many years is it supposed to take to fix this stupidity?
o02ppv,h2f4nho,,Christian shelters are the worse.  Yes they exist just google secular shelters.
nydru5,h1jnhjj,,they will surely have security cams?  might even need to log in/out times based on security fire safety?..unsure myself  did the uber pick you up from the hotel with your bags?
nydru5,,h1jor9x,Yes. I told day Manager check Camaras at 6am. Uber  picked me up at 615am at hotel.  This manager claims proof, yet has none. Sounds like a scam. Do I have any recourse besides bank?
nydru5,,h1jrdm4,If you talk to your bank about it and they do a chargeback, they have to inform the hotel and get their side of the story. With no proof on their end, they have no case.
nydru5,,h1mqryr,Why would you want any recourse besides bank? What do you think would b easier than refuting charges at bank?
nydru5,,h1l3pad,perhaps ask the lawyer subs whats your best position...
nydru5,,h1m2rum,Don‚Äôt do that. Each state and each country has different laws and you don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs responding to you from where. Plus many people on those subs are not lawyers. That‚Äôs always bad advice.
nydru5,h1jn67t,,Your bank will handle it as fraud call them
nydru5,h1jn4m1,,I assume it was a credit card you used? If so, you can tell the credit card folks what happened and they will credit you or investigate the situation. I'm only guessing but you should be able to get the extra day reversed.
nydru5,h1jp46n,,How long ago was this? 3-5 business days is pretty typical, so if it were late last week, I‚Äôd imagine you may here Monday or Tuesday. That said...  It does sound like they are up to something shady. A lot depends on the brand standards and whether it is franchised. I‚Äôm betting it is, and has shady owners. If you used a debit card through a national bank, contact them on Monday and explain the situation. The process isn‚Äôt as easy or straightforward as with a credit card, but get it started. Then reach back out to the brand, make sure you have all the details you posted here, and do it between 8am and 6pm Monday; even call centers give their big bosses the day off and you want to be able to escalate. They may say someone needs to call you back; it takes time to investigate a claim, pull the camera footage, pull the ‚Äúproof‚Äù they have, etc. Simultaneously hit them up on Twitter, let them know you were charged for a night you didn‚Äôt stay.   Above all else, stay calm when dealing with them. I‚Äôm speaking from both a customer service standpoint and someone who is currently functionally homeless. There is such a stigma attached to it that even if you are totally in the right, you can be dismissed. And even without that, a compassionate attitude towards customer service agents will get you far, especially when it‚Äôs their company‚Äôs mistake.  Best of luck, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. Having money taken like that when you‚Äôre already down and out is such a huge blow.
nydru5,h1klpvs,,Worked as an ATM tech, and have enough knowledge to know exactly what to do, but obligatory IANAL.  There's typically 3 things you can do at your bank to rectify EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) issues.  I'll list them, however #1 is for you, the rest are in order of importance, and why it probably wouldn't work  1. File a fraud claim, whether someone legitimately charged you incorrectly, or maliciously, this is not a failure of equipment and thus falls under fraud investigations.  Do not wait, some banks will claim you are liable over X number days of not reporting it. 2. Do a Chargeback, now these I'm not too familiar with, but basically from what I know it is like telling your bank I didn't receive what I paid for, and want my money back.  The reason is most business's will fight this, and typically the bank immediately sides with the business off something as simple as a receipt.  We need an investigation, not a chargeback. 3. File a EFT Dispute, aka Regulation E dispute.  These are used in situations where an EFT goes wrong, such as an ATM jamming up and not giving you money, or giving you only a partial payment (ATMs are programmed to immediately deposit money back into your account, so often times an EFT dispute is unnecessary).  We do not believe this to be mechanical or electronical error, it's human error.  Thus fraud would be my main go to.  Again, I can be wrong here, but I believe the right investigations will be opened with a Fraud Claim.  If that fails, just to poke the bear some more, do a Chargeback.  If the bank still pushes back on you, do an EFT dispute.  The idea being here, you're simply doing what is within your power.  It's up to the banks to contact the seller and gather information.    Investigation Example:  In the case of ATM issues, say you were shorted 40$ of a 100$ transaction, and only received 60$, you thought nothing of it, but a week has passed, and you're 40$ has not been deposited into your account, and you still show a full 100$ withdrawl.  You will file #3, a Regulation E dispute, or EFT dispute.  Even if you don't have a receipt this regulation requires that the provider of the service (The ATM company) PROVE you got the money through an audit, and records from the machine.  Not the other way around, you do not need a receipt.  I would assume this is the same for Fraud, seeing as we know where the issue occurred (and whom).  In turn I assume it would be up to them to prove to the bank you were there for the additional night, not the other way around.
nydru5,h1juh5v,,Didn't you get a paper receipt with the checkout time?
nydru5,,h1jvzp4,Sadly, no. Didn't think of that. Yet night manager remembered me and gave me 5am call. I talked to nite manager while there and he knew I was checking out. Just weird about day Manager.
nydru5,h1jnvo1,,There must be a consumer protection agency in that state. I would file a complaint with them. Also, write to all the board members and cc them all to each other.  Whether they are corporate or franchise, they‚Äôll have their asses kicked for fraud.
nydru5,,h1jrdf9,Thus far, I wrote a bad review on them.  I'm thinking of contacting BBB and attorney general. This is fraud. I never signed for the charge, have ample evidence I was out of room at 6am, yet at 1 pm next day I was charged! Manager claims proof, yet when asked, I was hung up on.  This isnt a roach motel either. I Now I got to deal with the idiot hotel taking time out of my life. Ugh!
nydru5,,h1js0ej,Probably the quickest way to get your money is what someone else said,contact your bank or credit company and claim fraud. You‚Äôll get your money almost immediately credited until they do their investigation. Almost always they decide in your favor, and you get to keep your money. I would still file complaint and contact the board via emails. Make sure you CC each other so they jump over each other to be the first to appease you. You might even get some comp from them, who knows.
nydru5,,h1jsw9j,Ok. What do you mean by board? Sorry I m confused. You mean corporate? I called a week ago and no response so now I'm calling my bank.  You think I should file complaint with BBB( I don't think hotel is affiliated with them) and attorney general?   It wouldn't surprise me if they've done this to others. Some of the reviews on hotel show they double charge ppl.
nydru5,,h1jtj33,Board of directors of the hotel/motel. That would on their headquarters website. Calling and email are two different things. Email all the board members and cc each other. BBB is fine attorney general is fine too. They are crooks if that‚Äôs how they run their business. Do Yelp review too.
nydru5,h1kbwm8,,I am suspect about you, OP. You have ignored the only good advice in this thread, which is to call your bank and dispute the charges. It will work as long as you are being honest, but will be terrible if you are fibbing.
nydru5,h1li8nw,,I have never in my life heard of a hotel making someone have to check out at 5 am.    But yes, all motels and hotels are con artists. So many different fees and such that just aren't warranted.   Your bank will handle this situation.
nydru5,,h1nwyze,I need to clarify: Checkout is at 11am. I had to leave at 6am to get to greyhound.
nydru5,h1m5h7s,,Chargebacks are usually done by the manager and she would have to prove you were there without a doubt and the bank will still most likely refund you and deny the hotel. I was a hotel manager for two years and some managers, not me, throw away chargebacks without looking at them. I‚Äôm sorry you had a frustrating experience :(
nydru5,h1rrc80,,Call the credit card company. They are stealing from you
nydru5,h1rre5o,,You got a receipt when you checked out right? Did hear from when my old boss was working in Vegas the hotel she was in how to Dropbox the keys on every floor. Sometimes people will pull the keys out of the Dropbox go in their room call down to extend and get a night stay for free
nydru5,h1k5tb8,,To be fair it might have not been the hotel's fault. Someone could have just asked for another night in your credit card. I would say in the future just use a visa gift card but a lot of hotels wont use those. The best thing is get a hotel gift card and use a credit card with not a lot of money on it. If the hotel is $100  for the night use a credit card that has $200 and take out $80  or spend it on something else. They cant overcharge you if the moneys not there. You can just go buy a money order and send the credit card the payment for the atm withdrawal.They love credit cards because they know they got u on the hook for upgrades and room services and fees. In Las Vegas hotels they have their mini refrigerators stocked full of goodies. They know if you take something out they can charge you for it.
nydru5,,h1k7sw3,Wow. How is that possible for someone to use my card? I was paid up till Monday. I would have to go to front desk Tues to sign and charge for another day as well present my id.  I think the hotel is playing games. I mean, I asked what proof she has and I was hung up on. Literally, my card shows I was in another state by 1 pm.  If they rolled back Camara it shows I left with my bag, got in Uber to get on Greyhound. Literally, night manager gavee wake up call as well.
nydru5,h1js9q7,,Ngl dude, I sleep next to a dumpster. I have a job too but can‚Äôt afford a hotel or air brb every night.

nydru5,h1k9hkk,,Someone could have just called and asked for another night. You do know people can just hack in your phone right and get your name with your number right. It may have been someone hacking into the hotels database. Anything's possible.
nydru5,h1kt0ns,,I'm confused. You checked out at approximately 6am on Nday. At 1pm you were charged for the following day, Nday +1?  Or until 1pm on Nday, where checkout time is after 6am and up until 1pm or so?  Hope this isn't making it more confusing....
nydru5,,h1mvpnl,Oh yeah interesting point, I had assumed it was the former but if it‚Äôs the latter that could explain it
nydru5,,h1nxg5p,Ok. Checkout time is 11am. I checked out 6am Monday. I was paid till Monday up till checkout of 11am.  Day Manager charged me Tuesday at 1pm.  If I stayed past 11am I would've have been charged another day.   I have ample evidence I was out on my day of checkout. WTF I was charged 24 hrs later, who knows. I have limited funds, so it's bs.

nxpkyr,,h1h7n9n,I'm sorry I think my post was little bit hyperbolic. The point I was trying to make is that alot of the housed in America see the homeless as being a separate class altogether. I was formally homeless and even now, years later, I rarely tell people that I used to be homeless. It's because when I have in the past I've gotten some very negative reactions even though I got my shit together. The stigma makes alot of housed people not want homeless moving in next to them. This is the reason why it's so difficult to build new shelters, low income housing, rehabs, needle exchanges, section 8 etc. I'm sorry but alot of people consider us trash and alot of other people say they want to help on the condition that it's not in eyeshot

nx2wv9,h1ct3b9,,Absolutely my best wishes to everyone in this sub.
nx2wv9,h1dggv0,,I was there for awhile too and it was 100% because of my family screwing me over.  My mom has her head out of her butt now and is actually being pretty gd awesome helping me get in better health.  Im back in MY house, finally won disability and things are getting better. There is NO EXCUSE for this wealthy country to have one single person go without a meal or spend one night somewhere that is not their own home unless they want to.  Honestly, there is also NO EXCUSE for one person to not have healthcare in this country.   Sometimes I see stories of experiences in cities with folks being moved and the police basically chasing them from one site to another, i guess hoping they will die of exhaustion.  Hostile architecture makes my blood absolutely boil. I live in an old farm house on 15 acres and sometimes I think I would like to say if you need a place to pitch a tent in peace while you work on getting yourself in a better situation, you are welcome here.  But its rural Texas so there are no jobs AT ALL, Medicaid was never expanded and social services are limited and require lots of hoops and traveling to even apply and keep help if you are lucky enough to get it.   My DMs are always open to anyone who wants to talk, commiserate, or just vent.
nx2wv9,h1civvu,,I agree a hundred percent. Nobody in this country should be without food or shelter. Nobody.

nx2wv9,,h1cuidv,You're completely insane and your view that homeless people have all done something to deserve it is bigoted, unwanted and your approach is so fucked up that I can't tell if this is a troll.

nx2wv9,,h1cus6h,You didn't manage to just slap any christian who has been homeless in the face, you also somehow managed to slap Jesus' own message about the homeless in the face.  You're kind of going to hell.
nx2wv9,h1enwne,,Education is also a failure. I'm out here because I was born with a condition that's actively left out of schools and only taught in a certain college class.   This made life hell. Then came being an adult and it only got worse. I was used and abused because of how I was born and over and over my existence denied. So I dealt with bouncing in and out of homelessness because I can't afford to live in a neighborhood where I'm safe from violence due to rent being so high and no one legit wants to hire me or take the time to get to know me.  Lots of things need to change. We know it. It's reported on the news. Yet no one wants to actually do anything to change it.
nx2wv9,h1erytb,,I absolutely agree.  Its fucking sick.  We have more empty houses that we do homeless in the U.S.  Think about that.  For every homeless person you see, there is an empty house somewhere.
nx2wv9,h1f9xis,,The Tathagata (Buddha) points out that the very root cause for all degeneracy comes from the failure of a nation of not taking care of the disadvantaged. A wise person will see clearly this is where all misfortune stems from in society. Solely from not taking care of the poor, the society crumbles. It is the root causation for the death of a nation.  It goes something like so: A noble wheel turning Monach (this is a really good and genuine king who cares for his people) is born. He wisely asks his advisors, sages, and so forth for advice in how to rule. They say to rule by love. By the Five Precepts. The king, his court, and his people prosper because of this.  When the poor come to him, his aides wisely recommend their basic needs are taken care of. So they are. All leave the kings presence with joy. None suffer. All prosper. The king is loved by his people and the king loves his people. The nation is secure. Poor and rich, all eat and have human dignity.  After 7 successions, with similar wise kings, the last king to be born is a bit of an arrogant one. He wants to rule his kingdom as he sees fit and not how his kingdom would best be run. So he doesn't ask any advisors anything. He simply assumes he will handle it best.  So a poor person comes one day and he turns them out. They, truly just being an average hungry person, hesitantly steal from a market. They are taken before the king after being caught. The king listens, understands the situation and gives money to the poor person and forgives his crime. All are honest about their situation.  Now things happen in this way a few times before the last person who confesses is instead executed. Why? The situation has gotten really bad and since no one is being paid who is poor and disadvantaged, none brought back to their feet, many people now need to steal. Due to this, the king feels the need to set an example to establish order. It backfires.  The rest of this teaching the points how things start to degenerate from there. From not feeding the poor, hunger starts. Due to hunger, one must steal from those who have. Due to the execution, people no longer speak the truth but instead steal and lie when caught, to avoid death. Because of this courts and authorities are born to determine the truth vs. what is false. Words no longer hold power. Evidence is required. No trust between either party exists.  From this lack of food, one turns to drink and drugs. To other vices to alleviate the suffering that comes with being spit on.  Fools, unable to realize a body is a cohesive unity of moving parts, assume they can spit and disdain the homeless  Because of this arrogance and disdain, a nation spits on the lowest of it's people. It does not heal them. Not being healed, seeking a way out, the homeless can turn disdainful, angry, fearful. Suddenly, not seeing the humanity in one another, the homeless becomes a demon, the authority who clears him away some angel, and the normal citizens are happy about it all.  Except the hatred grows even more. Except the homeless average joe never was a demon. What was before a small issue becomes burning hatred for all humanity. Because of this, small groups are formed. These groups live by hate and fear and with no love or grace.  How did they come to be? From what was just said. And how does a nation die?  Those fallen people refuse their situation. Not only do they spit back, but they declare war. They are human beings after all and did and do deserve that dignity. Small groups come together. People who have disdain for current authorities unable or more like unwilling to feed them in their sorrows join in. Seeking freedom, war is waged. A nation is destroyed from within itself.  At the end, no noble king is born in a dying nation. What happens is fools take it over, who assume the ability to terminate life equates to any sort of actual power. They rule through fear. Tyrants take over. Citizens flee. The people and its nation die.  After many wars, either a Soverign king who amasses control over many lands (Alexanger the Great, Ashoka the Benevolent, take a pick of dynastic ruler) takes over that dead one as well, and restores in to a new nation, or it is abandoned entirely due to famine, lack of water, etc.  My advice for the homeless is exactly what I did. Have no hatred. Do not give into hate. This world and your situation isn't the final stop. Offer others your grace and it will return to you. Send them your Spirit and it returns. So send them only the best so that it returns to you. If they accept it then it is a gift in the present. If they do not then all you are wrapped up in is loving-kindness.  Do not accept when others spit on you. Keep calm and refined but not weak. Smiling is a power move. Calling the cops? Smile even more. Officers arrive simply smile. Let whatever happen happen, but your actions here must be your own. They send you to jail? It is a bed and meal.  Thanks for reading.

nx2wv9,,h1el6wd,I partially agree. We need ranked choice and more ideas brought to the table. The duopoly on our hands has been ineffective for at least 50 years now. It also has a lot to do with Citizens United and the way that the billionaire ruling class can bend the will of politicians with their influence. We need to can the filibuster, we need voting rights, we need healthcare and we need protections for labor organizers among many, many other things.   Will that happen as a result of neoliberal incrementalism? I am doubtful.   I protest, I rally, I write my Congressmen and Senators, I encourage everyone I can to vote and I do mutual aid in addition to being a social worker.

nx2wv9,h2iycau,,I beg to differ. Some people really want to get off society. Few but they exist.  Most people outside become mentally ill due to being outcast and in extreme poverty, this is a failure indeed.  The main problem is finding land. With that you can set up trailers, cabins, or parking if they have a car to give people some place to stay peacefully and recover. Some people tried to give homeless wood made shelters but the city fucked up his efforts.. there's a need to assemble and organize ..
nubvei,h0x3r9r,,My last time being homeless, I knew it was coming and asked for help. The agencies kept routing me back to each other, having me fill out housing apps with years-long waitlists, and telling me to just go rent a room (in a very expensive area of the country). I ended up moving somewhere with a much lower cost of living and was able to figure things out on my own.   The main agency that I‚Äôd been working with called me like 3 months later, all chipper and perky ‚ÄúHow are you?!‚Äù. I told her that it was a slap in the face for them to ignore me months earlier when I actually needed help, then call me like everything‚Äôs cool. I told her that I‚Äôd moved and figured out a solution on my own. She asked where I‚Äôd moved to, and I told her ‚Äúanother state, you don‚Äôt need to know as I‚Äôm not your client anymore‚Äù.

nubvei,h0xjgnr,,it seems like people are turning homelessness into business   create a non profit, to "help" people, get funding from the state government,   hire your friends and family  provide the cheapest, lowest cost option possible  almost like a for profit prison  a "no show" job for your friends and family, and subcontracting to them and keeping everything inside and pat themselves on the back for providing, what a great pbj sandwiches they gave out and how great they are for proving mystery soup/mystery meat sandwiches
nubvei,,h0xlwhp,You just realized part of the complex problem on why homelessness isn't decreasing. However, the people claiming they're seeing homeless people in tents in parks don't actually care to fix it and are happy along as the homeless are as miserable as possible, just as long as they don't have to see them.  The truth is different than how it's portrayed publically, which seems to be "a nice case manager at a shelter will get you back on your feet in a week." Most shelters are more unsafe than prisons and you'll experience regular violence by staying in one, hence why homeless people prefer the streets.
nubvei,,h0xmooz,ive heard on the grapevine there are 1 million or more people living in a trailer park in california alone  isnt that fucking crazy? i guess those nimby/rich folks wants the poor people to fuck off to a trailer park and not bother their river/lake/seaside community
nubvei,h0x4glu,,So sad. Was homeless on & off from 14-22, 26 now & only reason I have a home is because my husband is disabled and is thru HUD housing. If it were just me, I'd still be homeless. I hope things get better for you soon. Prayers, good vibes, whatever you believe in lol, sent your way.
nubvei,h0wmhcn,,#facts
nubvei,h0zf88i,,I was homeless for a long while. Still climbing my way out. The system isn‚Äôt set up to help the homeless. Sad to say, you have to do your own footwork. ‚ÄòRESOURCE CENTER‚Äô is a good one. They literally give you lists of shit you could have found yourself through 211 or google.
nubvei,h0yx9o0,,So true.
nusdoj,h0zhyq6,,after experiencing homelessness for about 4 years,   there is nothing more luxurious for me than to wake up in a middle of my sleep, walk to the bathroom and take a piss/shit, or when im feeling hot and sweaty, walk to the bathroom to take a nice cold shower,  or the luxury of putting frozen pizza in the oven and setting a time and forgetting about it, and when the timer chimes you have a fresh pizza!  and all the other luxuries of you arent worried about your safety, can sleep fully, not worried about cops/strangers knocking on your window  as you can tell, im happy as hell for you :)
nusdoj,,h0zj934,The bathroom one is so real. I wake up every morning at 8am having to pee SO BAD, so I get up and drive to a bathroom, all the while I'm literally going to piss myself. And then of course I'm awake by that point. I'm also t1 diabetic so I drink excessive amounts of water :/
nusdoj,,h10991d,I‚Äôm also a T1D former homeless. It‚Äôs tough
nusdoj,,h0zk46c,oh man the bathroom  i have fucking nightmares about the bathroom situations  ive had more than 1 cases of fart turning into shart and walking awkwardly to porta potties, to clean the shit, i never trust farts anymore haha, i guess im getting old now.  or trying to take a piss into a gatorade bottle in the back of my sedan in the dark (trying to not attract attention) in my cellphone light, and accidentally missing the hole because i was drunk/high, and pissing over my beddings
nusdoj,,h0zigl6,Thanks! I‚Äôm super happy too!
nusdoj,h0zgn5z,,Awesome, glad you have family!
nusdoj,h0zcgwc,,Is your family ?  Glad you are off the streets.
nusdoj,h0ze5u5,,Happy for you
nusdoj,h0zvmqy,,this is why i used to sleep at interstate rest areas. the bathroom. ahhhh...such an appreciation even years later!!
nusdoj,h10eva6,,Happy to hear this! Congrats!

nurn2m,,h1l4qif,I just got in to town and got a hostel room for 2 nights. Trying to fly to France üá´üá∑ soon
nurn2m,,h1l4mwh,Hey I‚Äôm in NYC
ntovic,h0t31x0,,I go to food banks all the he time. So many budget brands i have never heard of. One day got a can of tuna, something i really like. Opened the can and it was a soupy mush and i went wtf?. so im reading the can, it says tuna with soy  isolates in vegetable broth or something and not one actual flake.. couldnt rven eat it it tasted so nasty.  I appreciate what they do but they regularly give out the cheapest most disgusting stuff ive ever tried to eat.  Contrast this with a couple supermarkets in the area who have actually removed their locked dumpsters and you can get name brand stuff all day. With some stuff like meat and poultry still frozen. And eggs, so many eggs not even at date yet, i regularly grab adozen when i check.  I cannot believe how much frozen food is in there every day.
ntovic,,h0t4x2f,this needs to be posted in that comments section, right on!
ntovic,,h0thy0m,Oh man, I‚Äôm in a midwestern city and we have amazing pantries here, tons of free fresh markets, and the farmers markets take food stamps at double. In some places you can even use wic at the farmers markets. Plus there‚Äôs community veggie gardens in the poorer areas, largely funded by the agriculture program at our big ten uni here.  Food in the winter sucks, unless you learn to get really creative with root veggies. But spring, summer and fall  it‚Äôs nice. I don‚Äôt care if my cucumber has a brown or if my onions should have been bought a week ago lol. I see it more as a zero waste thing.  I do, however, take a bit of an issue with the OP‚Äôs point. That wasn‚Äôt stuff that didn‚Äôt sell, that was stuff that was ruined. Sure you could probably take it home, cook it and eat it right away, but all meat I‚Äôve ever gotten from the pantry has been refrozen, which is a bit of a no-no even if it hasn‚Äôt been exposed to unsafe temperatures. All it would take is one person getting food poisoning, which is going to cost them days of work meaning rent, utilities, car payments, gas, daycare, etc.  Not only is it cruel to think that it‚Äôs okay to give unsafe product to poor people when it‚Äôs too good for you to buy, but it also would open the companies and the pantries up to huge legal liability. And possibly cause a worse financial cascade for someone already in a rough place.  TL;dr  I do think it‚Äôs great to want to help, and that there is entirely too much food waste, but it‚Äôs not an excuse to poison people for being poor, which is the potential there and why companies don‚Äôt already do it.
ntovic,,h0tmpxy,I'm just saying there is a difference between fit for sale and fit for consumption. Just because something isn't fit for sale, doesn't mean it isn't fit for consumption.
ntovic,,h0ufnix,I get what you're saying, but I think it's a stretch to say the food was ruined.  It basically spent a few minutes at an ambient temperature that was 3 degrees outside of the 'safe' range.  Everything was still chilled, just a few degrees warmer than required.  I'm guessing if someone had taken an internal temp of those big hunks of meat that they themselves were probably still within the proper range.  Most of that stuff is still in the factory packaging too.  Definitely not ruined.    I wish it was against the law to waste food like this.  I get not selling it, but allowing, much less requiring that it be put in a trash compacter should be criminal.  At the very least they could let the employees (with full knowledge of the incident) take what they wanted.  I feel like this should be offensive to every customer of this store.
ntovic,,h0vn3o5,My dad said today that the rule is 4 hours (he always goes by 3) for food like this. So technically it was 100% fine
ntovic,,h0w43g4,"but it also would open the companies and the pantries up to huge legal liability. And possibly cause a worse financial cascade for someone already in a rough place."  Laws were passed in most states to protect against that. While they can be sued, the bar is much higher for donated goods than it is for purchased/sold/bought goods. Not only that but good luck with finding a lawyer to do it unless the pantry/super market did something insanely bad. The reputation hit alone would put the legal practice out of business.
ntovic,h0t16ky,,This could have been donated and fed hundreds of people.   I keep trying to explain to people on the other sub the difference between fit for sale and fit for consumption, but I don't seem to be getting through to hardly anyone.
ntovic,,h0tmct3,Basic humanity is scarce for some folks
ntovic,h0u4j3i,,I'm so sick of people who aren't homeless speaking for the homeless
ntovic,,h0uxgqw,agreed  lets not turn r/homeless into another r/vandweller, vandweller is getting taken over by instagram thots and trustfundies showing off their 100k build
ntovic,,h0v9efj,I had an argument once with people about a video showing homeless people responding to shitty comments online. They said it was cruel. I said we can speak for ourselves. They said i see your point, but you're wrong. Its like telling a black person what its like to be black. Who tf are you?
ntovic,,h0vc0um,I think you misunderstood the op or me
ntovic,h0t62u5,,Shit I be happy to take any of that
ntovic,h0u4bud,,30% to 40% of the food in America is wasted. About a pound per day for each person.  https://www.rubicon.com/blog/food-waste-facts/  So yeah, that should have been donated. They should have just given it to their employees, who I'm sure are underpaid, starving, struggling, and had to work in the front lines during covid.  And just in case anybody brings up that "they can't give food away because of liability" nonsense that is a lie. It doesn't exist, businesses are protected from liability for donated food and have been for years.  https://publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/Liability%20Protection%20Food%20Donation.pdf  Edit: also here is how much food is thrown away at ONE Dunkin' Donuts. EVERY DAY.   https://www.tiktok.com/@kath.dias/video/6921394292413992198?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1
ntovic,h0tbk2d,,Good point. And when organizations "donate" for the optics, they will often give the cheapest, most unhealthy carbs imaginable, like boxes of dried potato flakes.
ntovic,,h0u9qzc,Those boxes of potato flakes are barely edible without water, butter and herbs to mix into them. It's like one time someone handed me a box of grits. I mean sure I thanked them but I had no pan, no butter nothing but the box of grits to stare at. I rumaged around and asked around if I split it with someone will they let me cook them but so many didn't know what they were or if they liked them. I googled it and figured it out.
ntovic,h0u4koh,,That looks like actual food. You know what doesn't? The food they give the homeless
ntovic,h0t4o0u,,the basic issue with these kinds of people is they are telling a homeless person/someone who knows the homeless whats best for the homeless based on their privileged and ignorant opinion. i would have loved the free food, otherwise i have to spend money on that shit. even if i had a stable life, i would consider going dumpster diving with a friend to save money and help the environment. these are some judgmental idiots.
ntovic,h0tqaed,,Food thats past its sell by date is nearly always good for days, even in moderate heat.
ntovic,h0txw9m,,My dad works at a food bank every weekend and he says they donate between 2-5 tons of bread to pig farmers every week because the bread is expired. Why the fuck are we baking this much bread!
ntovic,,h0uxks6,and the bread they give us are moldy, if not molded yet, when you bite it, it tastes so fucking disgusting you have to throw it away  few days ago i got some french bread from my pantry, i was so happy to see it, and when i tasted it afterwards, shit was fucking expired and made me gag and throw up
ntovic,h0uofwd,,Look, the people giving you shit can go suck a dick, I used to go skipping, hell, if I spot something sticking outta a bin that's good I'll still grab it. Food waste is abhorrent....   I was homeless for a looooong period of time, with literally nil income, my only food source was what was donated and what I found in skips. that was it, and I tell you what, food is so much better when it hasn't been in a bin
ntovic,h0v2toz,,Foods still good, it‚Äôs just their regulation/ rule. So fk all the haters, I would even be like gdamn this is good stuff even if I wasn‚Äôt homeless. This is way better then the food pantry‚Äôs that are always raided and the bare min choice up in those places
ntovic,h0u83hj,,You mean you don't like the packet of three crackers and stale biscuits? Smdh
ntovic,h0uwcu4,,about 10-20% of the products that my pantry gave out were edible, its called lakeview pantry on sheridan in chicago,   fuck these food pantries thats giving out expires products. like how do you treat us even worse than possible?  the oranges i got, were mushy and beaten and when i tried to eat it, it had went bad  the apple pie i got - unedible  the donut balls they gave me - unedible, expired 4 days ago  the chicken rotisserrie salad they gave me - expired 3 days ago, i tried to eat it with bread, i threw up soon after, i guess it was not stored properly  the canned food they give us, all expired  the potatoes and onions - looks edible luckily  the disrespect i get at food pantry in chicago are just fucking terrible  i used to go to other food pantries, and if you dont line up early enough, all you get is canned corn, canned beans, and a box of pasta.  i stopped going to all the local food pantries and only go to the main state one, which is the one i mentioned, lakeview,   i tried to cook some of the chicken they gave me, when i put it in the oven and after 30 mins, i was expecting to eat a good meal, the chicken stunk so fucking bad. i had to threw it away. like how the fuck, one of the *best* pantries, give out meat thats rotten/expired and smelled like death, corpse, funerary place in india
ntovic,h0wsnu1,,Haters gonna hate. You have concrete respect from us Spain ‚úåüèº
ntovic,h0xdpdy,,I understand. I often go back and forth about whether giving away my heavily used but functional ‚Äúthings‚Äù is nice gesture or demeaning. I know about the food waste issues in our country and fully understand you are talking about minor imperfections that don‚Äôt really change quality of food. Thanks for connecting people with food they need!
ntovic,h1n1xi0,,One time a customer bought like 80 litres of milk at the grocery I stocked, left the store with it, brought it back and exchanged it for the 2% because they'd gotten skim.  Guess who poured 80 litres of fresh fuckin milk down the drain like a fuckin goober. Restaurants and businesses who prefer tossing to liability like that should be charged by the lb for food waste.
ntovic,h0u6m93,,Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt eat meat and cheese and give it to homeless people. Some people can‚Äôt handle how it feels in their digestive
ntovic,h0tjwbo,,The reason why people should resist doing that is because it will always be exploited by moochers. Large groups of sloths will ruin that concept in a heartbeat.  I've had both shitty and decent food at shelters. Be grateful for anything that is given for free. It's only meant to help you not starve while you get your life together. No one that is homeless should ever feel entitled to excellent, pricey meals. If you receive that, awesome. Be grateful. If you get a small, half can of shitty beans and a bottle of water(I've actually gotten that before) then you should be equally grateful.   And if you're spending multiple years of homelessness with zero employment and zero ability to treat yourself from time to time while being entirely reliant on charity foods, then the problem doesn't lie in the quality of the charity, but your lack of effort to be productive and independent and a desire to be coddled and cared for by others. Unless you're physically or mentally disabled, that is. (Not talking to you specifically, OP. Just in general to anyone reading.)

A lot of privileges can be had when you have an address, especially stuff like state bennies, ID cards, etc. Have fun showering whenever you fucking feel like it. Like 3 times a day in the beginning. And I hope you get a hot plate (I have an instant pot which I fucking love) and a chance to make yourself a nice meal.
nq70s8,h09al0k,,Search Google and reach out to every homeless help facility in your area, tell them briefly about your situation, and ask if they have any resources to help you prevent becoming homeless. If you're afraid to call them because of your mental illness, send emails.   Be sure to make it a point that you need mental health care as well, if you aren't already receiving it. At least one of those places should have some helpful information for you.   If you're in a small town and they don't have services to help you, contact those in the nearest city.   Good luck. It's great that you're reaching out before the worst has happened.
nq70s8,,h09ghy9,Thank you for your advice. I‚Äôm going to start researching shelters. I‚Äôm hoping it doesn‚Äôt come to that. :-/ The good news is that for now(knock on wood), I still have a job.

npfo8g,,h04tkrf,Ty.
npfo8g,h04wgm3,,As long as you are alive and working towards a goal you are A-OK.  Glad you have your car. Keep on keeping.
npfo8g,h05cojy,,When I lost my place at the beginning of covid I sold everything but my switch and my backpack full of camping gear. The friends who couldn't help but wanted to toss their two cents in kept telling me to sell my switch and I just kept telling them that I want some way to stay sane because I won't be associating with most other homeless people because the majority here are addicts and content so long as they get their fix.   So I walked 45 minutes into the woods and set up a teepee and rigged up my folding solar panels(gotta charge my phone somehow) and camped out for a bit til I could get my life together.   The fire was calming, the hot food I made myself was great but I smiled like a idiot and appreciated my Nintendo switch so much more during those times of long endless silence. It got my mind off my situation and actually allowed me to relax and I believe the fact I could actually relax a bit is why I was able to get my head straight and figure out a way to get myself back on my feet. It took almost four months and almost getting frostbite because it was below 20 degrees but I've just stood back up. I'm teetering but I'm hobbling along.   You got this just hang in there and never stop pushing. You just need that one lucky break and you never know when it will show up.
npfo8g,,h071im8,I‚Äôve done the same with my iPad. Yes, I could have sold it and gotten a few hundred dollars. However, being able to play games, use it to look for housing and jobs, and general entertainment was a sanity saver.
npfo8g,,h06r7wo,I also love my Switch
npfo8g,,h09ibs6,I find the very idea of taking a tent into the woods and bringing a handheld game console absurd. I am not homeless, I have leukemia and am recovering from a marrow transplant. If I could take a tent and spend some time in the forest, I would love to take my mind OFF this virtual world.
npfo8g,,h09k48n,Sure, everyone says that until you've been alone with your frustrations and worries for days in the deadly cold, darkness and crushing feeling of being alone. I didn't just sit in the woods and play video games. I only played it maybe three hours in two weeks. Camping in the woods in the winter takes work. Lots of chopping and gathering wood. When it's so starting and keeping a fire going is a chore. Keeping your core temp up while avoiding sweating is a difficult balance.   I would start a fire and warm up my tent and prop myself up on a makeshift bed and play my game for a half hour to relax. I had silence or general radio the rest of the day.   I love camping and don't bring my game camping normally but I needed a distraction from the fact my life was forcibly reset to a extent and I couldn't keep working towards my goals.
npfo8g,,h0fzvr4,I am not judging you here, I get it. Sometimes distractions are useful. I am going through very serious and sudden disease and I know it damn well that sometimes you just need to waste time, not even hours, but whole weeks.
npfo8g,,h0g1pfx,But is time ever truly wasted long as you're doing what you wanna do?
npfo8g,,h0gjpga,We want various things, we benefit in various ways. It's good to experience things oneself before assuming that the difference is not what another person says it is. What does it mean to waste time? It's not good to be nervous about wasting time all the time, but it's also quite good to find out things that are more productive or more relaxing or more whatever and do them, rather than being stuck with the things that were easiest to find, but not as rewarding.     You know that it's good to camp in forest without electronics, so you already know the difference and you're making a conscious choice. Meanwhile majority of people are missing out on a lot, a vast lot of experiences in life, because they're stuck in their ways.
npfo8g,,h0j4939,It wasn't much of a choice to be honest. It was suffer on the side of the road or walk a bit and find a spot to make a shelter and stretch out. Ok ok I guess it was a choice but it sure wasn't a leisure trip.
npfo8g,,h11dmxp,Sure it wasn't, but that's now what I was talking about here. You said yourself that on occasions you went camping in the forest. Anyway in every case we can choose to try to make our life a little better or choose to let go. If to let go means to suffer on the side of the road, it's good you had the strength and made the decision to make that time a little more bearable for yourself.
npfo8g,,h0cb8do,You sound bitter. Just because you wouldn't do it doesn't mean it's absurd. A game is a good distraction, and they're fun to play.
npfo8g,,h0fz1ed,How do I sound bitter? (I didn't downvote you). I am just saying, it's a really good idea to do one of the various things that calm you as opposed to distract you - from one end of actually meditating to, on the other, just spending time alone in the woods, doing calm things like trekking (without music on headphones!) or carving stuff out of the wood or fishing. All those things where your first immediate idea is that they are boring, maybe not absolutely boring, but hard to force yourself to do because you feel tempted to rather bring out your handheld or phone or tablet or at least listen to music or read a book. Try this from time to time, just spend a day in the forst in one or another way like a monk or scout or trapper. You can only see the full benefits if you let the whole experience last at least half a day. Works wonders for me.     There was a time I used to do it every week.
npfo8g,,h0g842u,I couldn't care less if I'm down voted by you or anybody else. My point is that there is no need to call what he prefers to do absurd just because you would rather trek through the woods and become one with the trees.  Personally, given the choice between playing games or fishing and carving useless shit, I would prefer the games. But your preference is not absurd either; it's just your preference.
npfo8g,,h0gj8uw,>I couldn't care less if I'm down voted by you or anybody else.  Great. Well, I do care because I think downvoting someone in a 1v1 conversation is pitiful.     I did not want to say that I prefer something, therefore other people's preference is absurd. I wanted to say that that thing I prefer is actually much better and those who don't choose it, 9 out of 10 do it because they just don't realize their mistake. I know you've got a problem with that, but this is my opinion. Not that I like it better, but that it, for almost any person in this situation, is strictly better. If you would always choose to do something that occupies you, stimulates and distracts over something that calms your brain down, you are constantly missing out on something awesome. If you think I should falsely say that it's just a matter of preference so that I don't seem arrogant, okay, but that would make me less beneficial to people around, because I would be diluting the message. I actually want people to experience that and this is why I said what I said. That's all.
npfo8g,,h0gzib1,You say that the  9 out of 10 people who choose to do something different than you would are making a mistake. How arrogant. Your way is not the only way. It's pretty pathetic that you can't seem to grasp such a simple concept. I'm done with this stupid back-and-forth.
npfo8g,,h11d7zp,yeah yeah, yawn.
npfo8g,,h11dbrb,and this time i actually am downvoting, because you're basically saying "nobody ever has the right to think he is right about something because that's.... arrogant". i wish morons like you could just be filtered out on the internet en masse

npfo8g,h0a2v10,,Hey, I've got the same laptop... homelessness is hard enough in so many big and small ways. Having a gaming device to escape the cares and worries for a short time is more than worth it.   As others have said in the comments, find whatever little happinesses you can along the way.
npfo8g,h0av2fk,,Good lad ,im glad you are staying happy :)
npfo8g,h08ggfz,,Rush B, go go go!
nojmf6,h01ohxr,,A bit misinformed there. If you are the type of homeless person who stinks, wears dirty clothes, and leaves a huge pile of trash everywhere you go, then people will treat you badly.  But if you're one of the cleaner homeless like me who take showers, wears a suit (got it from a donation bin so not super fancy lol), does their laundry, and picks up after themselves, then people will treat you fine. People have been extremely kind to me and a lot of random people have given me a place to stay, as well as a fuckton of free stuff. Respect for others goes a long way.
nojmf6,,h134xei,Thanks for your feedback. Glad you‚Äôve had that seemingly positive experience. Not everyone has the same experience, though. Not everyone has reliable/practical access to showers not suits nor laundry and etc.
nojmf6,,h0v3qs5,This. This. This.
nojmf6,h00psfx,,Unfortunately, there are a lot of homeless people who just don't care about anything. If you give up on your appearance, you won't care about leaving trash everywhere. They're are a lot of mentally ill people who just got tossed aside. A lot of homeless people are criminals. People have been taught that homeless equals dirty and drug addiction equals criminals. We're taught that we should just cut them out because tough love. When they hit rock bottom, they have no one to turn to.  It's all part of the system designed to keep poor people poor. Drugs aren't the problem. Our society is broken. We lost what's truly important. Communities are dying and people are miserable. It's not crazy to reject a culture that puts money over people.
nojmf6,,h019jbu,I agree with your first few sentences. I disagree heavily, however, with your sentiment that we live in a system designed to keep poor people poor. In fact, I'd very much so like an explanation on why you'd think that. I don't get how "the system" could even pull off an operation that causes people to have children far too young that they can't afford, be irresponsible with money management, and intentionally not develop useful skills so that they may find decent paying work.  There are opportunities literally everywhere. Anyone can go out and earn and use resources to become successful. Literally any person in the US can go out and become successful and financially comfortable if they wanted to. But, not everyone wants to.   Not everyone has the drive or the wit or the willpower. There are jobs out there. There are opportunities. There are resources. Technology is getting more and more advanced and more and more affordable. Anyone can do it.   I feel like if "the system" was out here intentionally trying to fuck over the lower class, then they wouldn't be tax raping the middle and upper middle classes and using it to provide insane amounts of social assistance to the lower class.

nojmf6,,h01dtm1,Nice instant assumption just to satiate your indignation, bud. I love when I share my opinions on these kinds of things and people assume I'm some rich, white guy, tradcon.  Clueless, disaffected (lol!) bubble.   Dude, I'm homeless and grew up on section 8, welfare, food stamps, free church food, you name it. And have lived at 2 different homeless shelters in 2 different states( the most recent being less than a year ago).  Less than 10 years ago, I was living with my 4 siblings, 5 cousins, aunt and aunt's bf, sister's bf, niece, mom and her bf in one broken down 3 bedroom.   All which came after living in a disgusting 2 bedroom with my 4 siblings and I in one bedroom(I slept on the floor), aunt in the living room, and mom+bf in her room. I was also working and going to college at the time.   Throughout my life I've seen the harmful effects that excessive social assistance has on people's work ethics and their desire to improve their lives. I've witnessed firsthand the very real fact that some people have no intention to work hard and make something of themselves and simply be taken care of.  There are plenty of resources and opportunities out there to become successful. And if you think that's a lie and there's a huge conspiracy to keep everyone middle class and up happy, and keep poor people poor, well then I don't know what to tell you.  I think I'm a perfect candidate to provide a take on this topic, dude. So, you can either provide a useful rebuttal and we can exchange ideas or take your half baked, easily offended, lame insult throwing, leftist energy elsewhere.
nojmf6,,h01xkti,You're definitely right about welfare. It provides just enough to barely survive and helps absolutely no one if it's a long term solution.  Also, this is just my theory, but I believe the two parties work together to keep the people divided. They act like a pump and dump scheme. Republicans slash taxes which will always look good on paper but typically cause a bubble. People start moving up the ladder giving the illusion of success. Then the bottom drops, banks take everything back and democrats come in bail the banks out...   Every 10 years or so, there's a crash and people lose everything. In the meantime, billionaires keep buying everything for pennies on the dollar. The middle class is under attack far more than the lower class. I lost my business and everything else during the 2008 financial meltdown. While our government was writing blank checks to the banks, my mortgage was still due with zero relief. The final kicker was the amount of taxes I owed after loosing every penny I busted my ass for.   I get what you're saying, though. You'll never get up if you don't try. You might fail, but that's okay. People are afraid to fail to the point where they stop trying. It's easy to feel hopeless. You can't think about going from homeless to success, it'll seem impossible. It's about doing the next right thing, one step at a time.
nojmf6,,h020r54,We found the pick me homeless person lmao
nojmf6,,h022hft,Nah, I just always have to put out disclaimers when I have discussions with uppity people online. Whenever I share a view and I offend a deluded, easily offended leftist, I immediately get accused of being either white(which I am not), rich or from a rich family(which I definitely am not), or far right(which I am not). And this guy's comment made me laugh because if he only knew the truth, then he would feel really dumb.

nojmf6,,h01vnqc,Can you really not offer a cogent rebuttal without all the ad hominem logical fallacies? If you're right, and he's wrong, then offer a rebuttal instead of insults.
nojmf6,,h01nqz7,Dude, I literally don't even know what you're trying to say right now. I've read it several times and have no clue how it correlates to my responses or to the topic at hand...
nojmf6,,h01vu6n,Let me clarify by saying that it's not just the lower class, but anyone who isn't at the top. The middle class is nowhere near the middle. Small businesses are taxed to hell. You are right about opportunity, though.   It's extremely difficult to move up the ladder when you start at the bottom. Most never get out of the hood and probably won't ever be accepted by the mainstream. Social assistant for the poor doesn't make up for the parents being in prison over drugs and a poor education.   Thank you for your response! Good luck in your endeavors. Much love!
nojmf6,h00g6jb,,Because it's classism if you're a college student you're paying money to attend that college so they automatically assume that you're paying back into the system homeless aren't valued because I don't provide anything to the system and a lot of people's minds they're considered leeches when a society is only built off of greed and what somebody else can provide for the whole entire system to benefit like paying taxes or owning a home the mindset is just left the homeless die off they don't contribute anything anyways
nojmf6,,h00mxf5,It's so backwards. We don't fit into a broken system filled with miserable hypocrites, but we're the crazy ones? You don't have to contribute to something you know is wrong. Capitalism is the problem, not people who reject it. As if a job at Amazon is going to make anyone happy. We were given a dream that isn't our own and told that 4 walls and a fence is freedom. That we're supposed to have a family and never see them. Sending our children to be brainwashed to learn useless information.   What a joke. Good luck on your journey! Enjoy the little things people are too busy to notice. Life is hard no matter what you do. My best memories aren't of the thing's I've had, there about the people I love. Sitting around a fire getting lit.
nojmf6,,h0sekur,This is the problem. Capitalism is required. If you aren‚Äôt producing, then you are taking from the people who are. If you aren‚Äôt working hard, then other people are working hard for you. It‚Äôs like being in a commune and forcing everyone else to do your dishes. You cannot just choose to reject capitalism while it is the current economic system.
nojmf6,,i1mhvyk,Excuse me, but with all due respect- f* k an economic system. If every person was raised on the same land as the last 10 generations of their ancestors, and spent their days toiling lazily with their predecessors and learning their craft (and/or developing their own set of masterful skills), We‚Äôd be JUST DANDY gosh darnit!      We throw away 3x as much food is consumed in this country, and the starvation of any population is simply passive genocide:     Enough food to make to world over fat and full falls from the literal sky every dang day if the dadgumm year. Ever seen an organic homestead after a couple generations? People are meant to be creative she solve problems at their own individual unique pace. This idea that we need this current system, when actually it needs is to exist, is asinine at best, and it perplexes me to see the masses not only fall in line but sit here and defend the oppressive slave state as a thing to be happy to be the machine that drives the theft of the only thing that we can‚Äôt get back or synthesize; our time.       So defend and embrace capitalism If you must, but myself and the other few rational free thinking humanoids out here are going to live like our ancestors. Loving one another, and sharing what we have and what we know with anyone who would like to eat and work. I will never be happy doing a strangers chores as a disposable SSN # and a role that can and will be handed off to the next person with a pulse and ourselves be forgotten before we get home.   I‚Äôd prefer to be in a large home full of multiple generations of my family and in-laws, their grandchildren and then the children of their children. Eating organic local food, sharing and trading our surplus goods and knowledge freely and looking out for family as well as our fellow human, whoever and however differ my they may be. Even if they have no home and no commodities-      The notion that homeless people ‚Äúdon‚Äôt contribute to the war machine so it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to both hate and encourage the mistreatment of such folks- is both fascinating and equally abhorrent. What allegiance do you swear to the crown? What does thy kingdom do for you should you need something like the financing for a bloody war that the only purpose of is to increase your own personal wealth? Will they send you a check? Do you have to have a business plan or any sort of rated credit history? What about a standing army? Will they provide you with these resources at the cost of 80% of their waking lives? Will they go without joy or travel or owning land or seeing their family indefinitely, so that you can make yourself fat?   I mean no ill will, only to expose the hallucination and utter hypnosis the public at large is widely and firmly under the effects of. If one person rejects the program they‚Äôve been duped into propping up because my words; it will have been worth the time.  -me  Race: human Origin: earth Sex: probably
nojmf6,h015165,,Honestly, for the most part, I'm pretty indifferent to most homeless and I'm homeless.   Homeless people that have no intention of being homeless and are trying to turn it around are few and far between. Most of them are either just total eye sores that make a place look like trash(the biggest reason people don't want them around), are completely insane/unpredictable, criminalistic, are thieves, or some combination of the first one and the others.  The last examples are straightforward, but the first one is the one that makes people the most offended. Rarely have I met homeless people that at least try to blend in with their environment and not draw attention to themselves.   Most of the time, they look haggard, are filthy, and are dressed in filthy clothes that are falling apart. For businesses and places, this pushes people away from wanting to visit and potentially puts them at risk. They bring down property value and are just unpleasant to look at.  The stigma is pretty fair if you ask me. It's not like there's tons of responsible, presentable, homeless out there. Only homeless with severe mental health issues or severe physical handicaps have any real excuse. Homelessness should be temporary for anyone. Sure, there are massive hurdles when you're homeless and literally everything is more difficult to get done, but there is always a way out, no matter how hard and painful it is to achieve.   The best way to avoid that stigma is to not appear homeless. Even if they're rocking free church clothes, keep them clean. Shower as often as possible. Keep hair presentable. I'm not saying to sport Gucci and get high fades. They just need to look clean and relatively presentable, to not be just loitering and hanging around all day at places, and behaving themselves.   If one were to find a job asap, get a 24 hour gym membership for showers, figure out a simple dwelling setup, be resourceful and manage money wisely, then they definitely can bring themselves out of homelessness well within a year.   Shit, I stayed at a homeless shelter once in a new state and knew absolutely no one. Found my nearest staffing agency and had a job in three days. It was shit pay, but I was eating a full dinner every night and had a place to sleep for free. I shopped around for cheap shitty motels and found one, surprisingly that also gave out free food every night. I was out of the shelter in three weeks.   Was I over the moon and livin' large and happy as hell, not really, but I had a place and pulled myself out of homelessness entirely on my own. Anyone can do it. Fucked up part is that I gotta do it again. Lol  And for the vagabonds, I suggest getting into tiny living. Get or build a teardrop camper or something similar. There's less shame and stigma to saying "Oh, I'm a tiny life nomad, full timing in my teardrop." than "I'm just a drifter who just wanders around and occasionally pandhandles when I need food and beer."
nojmf6,,h01drfw,Great for you that you got out once through hard work. Hope you somehow avoid this time around. What‚Äôs the cause for this time around?
nojmf6,,h01mzye,Thanks, man. And it's an unbelievably long and stupid as fuck story.   But, the jist of it is, I was paying to crash on my buddy's couch. He's constantly cheating on his old lady(even giving her STDs) and would always lie and use me as his scapegoat.   Any time he went somewhere and she questioned him, he would say I asked him to take him there. If she noticed he pulled out large amounts of money from their account for whatever, he would lie and I say I asked to borrow it.   This continued, with me getting fb messages from her every time an incident occured filled with fucked up insults and threats of kicking me out if I didn't stop. To which he would reassured me that that would never happen and to ignore it. He actually found the whole ordeal amusing that he would cheat on her, lie, and I would have to get the consequence.   It continued until she finally kicks me out while I was waiting on another room deal(that fell through after the fact). I demand that my buddy tell her the truth or stop it from happening, but he just goes "Sorry, bro. My girl's a bitch" and that was that. Luckily I had just gotten a car and just stayed in it while working.  Unfortunately, a month into me living in the car, I fucking get fired, for the first time in my entire life, from my job(whole nother fucked up story). And then, that same night, cops roll up on me while I was sleeping my car and drunk and I get a goddamn DUI and taken to jail. This shit just happened two weeks ago.  I can't even start my new job yet without my ID, that they took. And in order to get a new ID, I have to have a new birth certificate mailed to me from home state. My last check is dwindled down to almost nothing from gas, food, beer and my car insurance and phone bill coming in around the same time. Straight up stranded. It sucks. And I still have court coming up. I'm hoping the public defender can help me to convey that I live in my car and wasn't driving and the I hope the judge can have some mercy on me.  In hindsight, I could have made a ton of better decisions and avoided this shit, so I don't feel sorry for myself. But, it just stings and I hate this feeling of being perpetually in extreme anxiety/depression mode while also being alone. if I can hang in there and somehow get that birth certificate and ID and start my job, I know I can turn it around though.
nojmf6,,h01q4qt,I can't comment on most of this right now, but I've always been curious how people get caught when parked and drunk much less sleeping in the car drunk, How were you caught?  I've had a bottle of wine for a few weeks now that I really want to enjoy...
nojmf6,,h01qoz4,I had the car on for the AC and to charge my phone. I thought I was in a good location, buried in a parking lot next to other cars, but I guess I stuck out with my car idling, which is what the cops told me, as well. There was actually another guy sleeping in his car parked next to me that I had no idea about and they were hassling him, too, but I don't know what happened to him.
nojmf6,h04jqpo,,In my opinion, its a matter of it being socially acceptable. Of course there is horrible discrimination against just about every demographic out there. But I think that with all of those other groups, people are at least aware of social or legal consequences for treating someone differently in all of those other groups. It still happens, and its awful when it does. People do ignore or break the social agreements or laws that protect other groups. But with the homeless, its different. I believe that someone who would never do or say anything racist, homophobic, anti-Islamic, etc would mistreat a homeless person without a second thought. The social contract (or laws) of consequences for such behavior is simply not there. That, in my opinion, is a huge part of the problem. It is a (almost completely) overlooked part of civil rights.  I rarely get a very good reaction when I state this opinion, but I believe in it strongly. It needs to change. Homelessness is a peculiar and atypical minority group in the sense that the goal is, essentially, to stop being in that minority group. Its very different from other demographics. To be honest, I don't completely understand it myself, despite being formerly homeless for about 6.5 years. What I do know is that without that social barrier that makes it not ok to mistreat or be unfair to the homeless, people will show you who they really are deep down. Don't ever forget that Antisocial Personality Disorder is an official form of mental illness. The people who mistreat the homeless are the ones who need help, its just that the homeless have given them the opportunity to manifest their illness without social or legal consequences.  There's a lot of work still left to do. Its exhausting, so we need all hands on deck.
nojmf6,,h069xpc,Thanks.

noniaj,h0430hn,,No it is not required.
noniaj,h011v30,,Not in the ones I've been in since COVID started, but it never hurts to call ahead and ask, if you're able to do so. The shelters I've been to only offered the vax, but didn't force it on anyone.
noniaj,h018uzn,,They're trying to get people to get it. Tests and vaccines are being offered in mine but they are not forcing anyone, yet.
noniaj,h01cn0g,,Don‚Äôt know, but they shouldn‚Äôt. Everyone should decide for themselves what medical substance, device or procedure they put in their body, after all, no one is willing to sign on to take on any and all financial responsibility for any adverse reactions or death.
noniaj,,h01eif6,I definitely agree. This vaccine should not forced at all.
noniaj,,h01fhhc,All this people that are pushing for it will be nowhere to be found when shit hits the fan as it already has for some people like blood clots and death. Also, in the US, it has only been approved for emergency authorize use and not final approval,  since supposedly it‚Äôs still being studied. Everyone tells you it‚Äôs safe and effective, but how could anyone make that proclamation when the basic studies haven‚Äôt been completed. These so called unnamed experts claim it‚Äôs safe and effective. Everyone should do their due diligence research as no ‚Äúexpert‚Äù will part with their money and property for your care.
noniaj,,h01gvz7,We all need to stand strong, come together and speak out against this regardless of race, political ideology, background, etc. I am surprised that this issue is not getting more pushback especially in the US. A lot of people that I know have already gotten the vaccine. I am glad there are people out there like yourself who are very skeptical about this vaccine.  Our US government (as well as other governments) are trying to push for the COVID-19 vaccine passports. If this is not criminal, I am not sure what is.
noniaj,,h09s2j9,This is like if the shelters asked if someone has hiv or not. It's none of there business and its discrimination.
noniaj,,h01lgg1,Fear, bullying and bribery is the reason many people have gotten the shot. There are a lot that haven‚Äôt due to common sense and independent thinking. There are scientists, doctors and real experts who have come against it and questioned the shot, but unfortunately they don‚Äôt get news coverage and get censored. Research will give you the truth. If indeed the shot ‚Äúprevents‚Äù illness then they got nothing to worry about the rest, right? No need to bribe people to take a shot. If something is wonderful, bribery wouldn‚Äôt be needed. Anything that is ‚Äúfree,‚Äù question, as there is always a price.
noniaj,h025f83,,If they become required I‚Äôm not so sure a place doing that should be considered a shelter and more like experimental human chamber.   Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time the government conducted their tests and experiments on people on the fringes of society.
noniaj,,h03dmkf,Agreed.
noniaj,h05ptk2,,The one I was staying in didn't require you to have a vaccine but they did a covid test twice a month.
noi80f,h00fjwv,,I'm sorry you are in this situation. But honestly, if you have an offer for a place to stay, I would accept it.

Everything's too strong anyway nowadays, smoke tiny little bumps if you smoke, and never smoke if you have anything left to do with your day.
nlqlcs,,gzkojqj,If you don't smoke dope, you can get a job as a truck driver which includes a mobile apartment. There's a massive driver shortage right now. The apartment is called a Sleeper. If you're a waste of space just trying to bide time with drugs? Sorry for you.
nlqlcs,gzksddr,,I just moved out of a ford focus.  How do you sleep in it?  I put the backseat down and stuck my legs into the trunk.  If you go straight to substances while under stress, thats probably going to be a problem.  Try and nip this in the bud by finding more healthy coping mechanisms.  Hell, just zoning out on minecraft for 6 hours straight is healthier (it seems) than smoking a J for you.  What helped with my addiction like behaviours was therapy and rehab.  What also worked *FOR ME* was S.M.A.R.T. recovery.  Do whatever the hell **WORKS** for *YOU*.  If thats some weird chicken sacrifice, but it keeps you sober in times of stress - well then by all means do the weird thing that **WORKS** for *YOU*.  The physical motion of the soon to be job will also help with stress levels.  Nothing like a good workout to kill anxieties.  Here's a tip - if its been a while since you've worked out/used your body for 8 straight hours -- go for a walk or even jog in this time BEFORE work starts.  Your body will be less sore when it starts - and having a sore body when car living SUUUUUUCKS
nlqlcs,,gzlceqb,1) Sleeping in the Focus: I'm about 5'8 in height, so I'm not too tall. I just lay in the back and put the passenger seat forward so I can angle my feet against the passenger door and stretch out a little. It's too much for me to push the backseats down and try to do all that, but I've read about it on here. I guess if I was any taller, I'd probably be wanting to do that for sure.  2) Seeking Therapy: I actually went to my therapist today in person and happened to catch him at the front desk so I got extra lucky to schedule an appointment with him but he won't be able to talk until next Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. The last time I talked to him was a month or so ago so, he doesn't know about me being homeless, or heading to a shelter and also leaving that. I feel like it's going to be a lot to put on his plate but, I'm going to try and not overwhelm him.   3) I want to work out more but with the sleeping situation, I don't want to overdo it right now. I'd like to rent a room first, or get an apartment before I really start hitting the elliptical again. Eating right and balling out on that one piece of workout equipment really helped me last time. I'm at least walking a little everyday, but I could up that. It's just hot out now until easy to get sweaty, so I kind of try to hold back like I said until I get a place but I definitely want to work out more.  ... and what you said about running to smoke weed because I was stressed: that is a great point. I'm definitely aware of it, and can say that this time: I tried to talk to my therapist first but it didn't work out since he couldn't see me immediately. I really wanted to though, and I might have to find an online therapist who is more accessible. Been hearing some good stuff about it.   Thanks again for all the help you guys.
nlqlcs,,gzlvx0e,>I feel like it's going to be a lot to put on his plate but, I'm going to try and not overwhelm him.   Oh, no dude, overwhelm him!! First it's his job, second he needs to know just how bad it is for you right now.  If you can overwhelm a therapist, then you need to get another therapist.  Trust me, it's ok to tell him everything.    Going to see doctors is always embarrassing!  It's like you gotta show your asshole to a complete stranger - but that's what doctors/healers are there for -- to see the WORST side of us so that they can diagnose and begin to help you fix you.

I was kinda spazzing out since having to check out this morning, but your post helped me calm down a bit, and have a little hope.   Thanks Joe! üß°
nlqlcs,,gzldydp,There was a couple nights when I was first out here in the car that I definitely was looking at hotels. My indecisiveness led to me not getting one, but who knows - I might do it a night or two here and there.  Somebody on here before mentioned:  paying for a hotel room every three or four nights is equal to about a month's rent. If I ever decide I'm going to stop roughing it for a night or two, I just remember that little piece of advice.  Airbnb doesn't look like it's that bad either for monthly rentals in my area, and if all you have to do is just pay, and they don't worry about all this other stuff like credit checks, then it seems like the most convenient way to get a place for an extended period of time.  I guess there's definitely not a shortage of places in my area, it's all about picking the right fit.   Just remember that we're all here for you, just like people are here for me when I post. Just keeping things like that around in your head can help alleviate some of the worries you may have. I know it's all just text on the screen in the end, but everyone's been pretty supportive every time I post. One of the least judgmental communities I found on here, for sure.
nlqlcs,,gzlkx35,Thank you for responding, Joe. Yes, the motel rooms ARE ridiculously priced. I find the best deals, but it is still always $50-$60 per night. That's a lot to pay for a little bit of home-like comfort. And it's so irritating that the hotels/motels are never even close to full occupancy but they won't offer reasonable weekly or monthly rates.  I'm 51 and disabled... my biggest dreams anymore are of just having a damn toilet.  Pretty pathetic, eh? And a sink to wash my hands.. It just hurts so damn much having to squat by the car. The constant fear of being caught. Those awful #2 moments when public restrooms are all closed.  Well now that paragraph is embarrassing but oh well, it's reality.  I hope you find the right fit for yourself. I suffer from complex PTSD (among other things) so for me, a completely private space is necessary.  Yes, this is usually a pretty great place. But my near psychotic suicidal rants lately have left me too embarrassed to post most of the time.   You're a smart guy, you've got this. I am so happy for you.
nlqlcs,gzl8tqm,,You will make it. Good luck
nlqlcs,gzlxwve,,Next time you feel the need to smoke, try a lions mane! Takes the edge off without messing you up. I was a long time smoker, but between my age and how cracked out weed is nowadays I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. Now I do Paul stamets lions mane, but even this you build tolerance so use it sparingly.
nlqlcs,gzmszqh,,You're doing good.  Check out /r/petioles - it's a weed sub for people who are interested in 'responsible consumption'. A bit less focused on quitting, but everyone's aware of the negative consequences of their addiction, and wants to make good choices.
nlqlcs,,gznizdl,Will do.
nlqlcs,gzp4yw2,,i have some very cost effective pills with a microdose of thc and 10mg CBD. microdosing is awesome for me, puts me right  in the daydream zone and i can enjoy wandering around for hours. i have found that these little softgels i can get are super easy to swallow without liquid so i dont need edibles. microdosing weed and mushrooms tends to be great for people going about daily life, and i would say its great for well being. using weed to help handle homelessness is the least harmful thing i can imagine. its so easy to take a little and damage is highly unlikely if youre not driving while high.
nlqlcs,gzsf28p,,getting a room in a house is always cheaper than an apartment in my experience. just harder because you have housemates. But if you have a good housemate situation its great.
nlx9ct,h0215nv,,maybe there's a minecraf server for that
nkt6au,gzew8qv,,share one bathroom with another dude - but there is a mini kitchen off to the side where there‚Äôs a toaster oven, hot plate, fridge and freezer
nkt6au,,gzjqce0,This could easily have been modified without permits and without being up to code.  Does it have a smoke alarm?  And a carbon monoxide alarm?  If not, protect yourself by getting them.  A battery-powered combo alarm is about 30 bucks online - shipping included.  If you are really short on cash right now, at least get a smoke alarm - 5 bucks from home depot.  [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Kidde-Code-One-Battery-Operated-Smoke-Detector-with-Ionization-Sensor-21008051/100051755](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Kidde-Code-One-Battery-Operated-Smoke-Detector-with-Ionization-Sensor-21008051/100051755) Then get a CO detector later when you have the money.  &#x200B;  Sigh.  I just noticed that someone downvoted this.  How does someone object to advising the OP to be safe?
nkt6au,,gzsfo4t,can't hurt to get a smoke alarm. but getting things up to an expensive, often arbitrary code is an extra barrier to housing. its a safe place to sleep with a roof, if its cheaper because its not ADA compliant or whatever, who cares.
nkt6au,,h23v2go,Yep, my roommate in my old apartment claimed to advocate for the homeless, but had this very same train of thought and reported our fire hazard issues in our basement apartment to the city without telling me, but I knew because he was complaining about it on multiple occasions and was the only one who knew about this kind of stuff amongst our household. He moved out, then the city inspectors came, my landlord asked me to lie about certain things to them or I'd be kicked out, so I did, ended up getting kicked out anyways because of the inspection and almost ended up on the street because it wasn't a formal eviction and I didn't want that on my record. People who think this way aren't helping. I could have kept one of the best places I've ever lived if it hadn't been for him.
nkt6au,gzfxagt,,I found one in Lincoln Nebraska for 350 a month. Way better than nothing and it allows me to work without worry of my stuff getting stolen while I'm working.
nkt6au,gzemaxj,,Nice man!
nkt6au,gzezgtj,,Good for you. You don‚Äôt need fancy pad, just the basic necessities. Some peace of mind. You did good. Congratulations.
nkt6au,gzesk02,,So happy for you!
nkt6au,gzgah7e,,Congratulations! I think it's a pretty good size. You have enough room to walk around a bit. Some rooms here in nyc for 600 are just enough space for your bed. I found one place near chinatown for 400.00. It was a bunk bed in a room with no windows. You get the whole bunk bed. But the room was so small you couldnt get dressed standing up. So I think you did good.
nkt6au,,gzgdyuy,Better than sleeping outside.
nkt6au,,gzgef22,In the summer with 4 other chinamen packed into the apartment. 1 sleeping in the hallway. I couldnt stand that. I'll tough it out at the shelter.
nkt6au,gzflxuu,,Congratulations!!!
nkt6au,gzffqja,,CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!
nkt6au,gzghkky,,Awesome! Congrats
nkt6au,gzgi7hc,,Congratulations bro
nkt6au,gzemq8l,,Better than sleeping on a sidewalk. Congratulations!
nkt6au,gzgj06e,,Good job
nkt6au,gzgpxhw,,That's gorgeous!
nkt6au,gzgyqa3,,Fuck yeah, looks lovely man. Congrats üôèüôè
nkt6au,gzijdy4,,I wish I could have found that. I went to PDX trying to find a room and got myself homeless. Had to bolt. I'm glad you found something
nkt6au,gzenp2g,,Not bad
nkt6au,gzeujiv,,Do you have your own bathroom  and can you have a microwave  ?
nkt6au,gzewkw0,,Hey I live in Eugene. What‚Äôs with that price though? Outrageous I think? I‚Äôm happy af for you, but you sure must have a great job to afford that price? Best wishes! PS I was homeless for 7-8 years down here, prices aren‚Äôt much different right now‚Ä¶
nkt6au,,gzfbtjv,this is the city of portland - 33rd and ainsworth - houses around here go for 650-850k now a day--this is an absolute steal--the rooms in city if portland trend for about 850 a month+utilities
nkt6au,,gzimp69,Wow. Thanks for explaining, I had no idea that Portland had come ups like that. Hell you can‚Äôt even find a room here and if but some chance you do you‚Äôll have to pass background checks and pay to fill out the rental app, all kinds of hurdles. Good on you brother for getting your own place. I wish you the very best. Out of the rain, snow, and cold.

nkt6au,,gzhi1x1,My apartment was $750 for 2 bed 1 bath 890 square feet. $600 is expensive.
nkt6au,,gzin9ct,Turns out that‚Äôs just the normal cost of living in Portland, Oregon
nkt6au,,gzsg3u4,WOW where are you? that is absolutely unheard of where I am (seattle). Here its $1000 for a studio.
nkt6au,,h0qmele,$700 for 3 bed 2 bath townhouse with a finished basement in Wisconsin.   There‚Äôs a ton of good paying work out here, only downside is you need a car.
nkt6au,,h0r582r,Sweet
nkt6au,,gzfbfap,Outrageous? That seems pretty cheap tbh nowadays
nkt6au,,gzf0s7r,Thats not expensive. I had a room downtown recently that was m smaller and shared kitchen and bathroom with 20 people. It was $995/month
nkt6au,,gzf8vl5,Might as well be in San Fran!
nkt6au,,gzfgi90,It's getting there for sure
nkt6au,,gzh5422,That‚Äôs crazy. You‚Äôll lose your mind.
nkt6au,gzmbnzw,,I'm sorry that non-creative people are offering you this opportunity.  Wish there were a better way, though it's better than wet socks.  Rent seeking NIMYism is repulsive.
nkt6au,gzj1xks,,Nice dude.
nkdh7c,gzcw485,,Congratulations on the new job and having a car. Now, cut your toenails.
nkdh7c,gzcejqe,,Excellent
nkdh7c,gzd09jw,,Okay, so, that's super fair, but I keep them long because I get ingrown toenails like you wouldn't imagine. That being said, they're hecka long, and you're right.
nkdh7c,gzdoo9h,,Nice job!!! I have an interview today for marianos
nkdh7c,gzdxl7v,,Nice. There's really decent money in that field, especially in the aerospace industry.

nk7836,gzbx8xm,,Go back home please , may be hard but unless you are in psychical danger I suggest that u tough it out and prepare to leave properly
nk7836,,gzfup39,How would you advise me leaving properly ?
nk7836,,gzfvbzy,Find a place to go ,  shelter , find support , this may not be possible in your situation but sometimes in desperation we don't think clearly , I just want you to be safe , call and get help with your situation if you can reach out to ppl I never really thought it through tbh , I was just thinking about your  welfare ü•∫ but there are resources available in most situations
nk7836,,gzfwiaq,Thanks for looking out for my welfare. I want back home last night after forgetting my cash and my parents were holding me and preventing me from leaving.
nk7836,,gzgwtzk,Is there someone you trust that you can talk to?  If you ever need someone you can mssg me just stay safe
nk7836,,gzgz8ws,OK I will do that

njbg6k,gz6mqj4,,Yeah you just never know until you sit and speak with somebody, but you do have to ask yourself why and always expect the unexpected not to be paranoid but to be cautious and mindful
njbg6k,,gz6n5ag,Yeah no, as a young small woman, I‚Äôm overly cautious. But I‚Äôm also too compassionate, so I try to stay as safe and in public as I can. If ima die, might as well do so doing something that fills my heart, bc I don‚Äôt wanna be here anymore but I‚Äôm pushing through so I can help others
njbg6k,gz6w6bw,,what a nice kind hearted person you are ,i know what its like to lie in bed for days on end because of depression and how hard it is to get yourself motivated and face the world anxiety through the roof ,good on you for that being the reason to get out of bed . I hope you can get well from the depression .
njbg6k,,gz6xp7r,Thank you, it fills my heart to know that I can live to help others when I can‚Äôt help myself. Helping others helps me too, so I‚Äôll take advantage of that every secondüíó
njbg6k,gz7b6mp,,Good on you üëçüèºGratitude comes from helping someone less fortunate and can lift our spirits. The chemicals in our brains do react to actions we take. Well done. Keep passing the open doors.üåø
njbg6k,gz6orlg,,Good for you! I think we're taught to ignore homeless/street people, not always without good reason. it can be hard to get past that--and you have to actually want to, I think--and see a human being. Here's hoping you made a new friend.
njbg6k,,gz6p44u,Yeah, I was taught homeless people were lesser basically. Now that I‚Äôm an adult and have experienced life, I just can‚Äôt ignore it, it really makes me want to cry when I see others struggling. Life is hard as is, we can help each other out.
njbg6k,,gz7geio,You also have to remember some people stay homeless because that's the way they want to be that's the lifestyle they live nothing wrong with it everybody's different, I admire your empathy for them
njbg6k,,gz7hdqo,Yeah I‚Äôve been learning a lot from the people I meet. I just wanna make sure whoever I cross paths with is safe and taken care of. They‚Äôve got a friend here anytime they need it!
njbg6k,gz7r7qd,,Not sure which city you live in, but there are usually volunteer organizations that work together in groups of caring folks like you to help the unfortunate, but do so safely.
njbg6k,gz9s1rl,,What a great thing to read first thing in the morning. Good for you and him. That backpack and conversation mea t more to him then you will EVER  know.
njbg6k,gz74imu,,Did you know that you can get rid of depression doing charitable work and volunteering?
njbg6k,,gz78jpr,Yes! Volunteering with helping others or the environment/animals has helpeda lot to keep me from spiraling down into my depression.  It helps me get out of the dark places of my mind when I focus my attention on helping someone else.  I‚Äôm not saying it will always work 100% but it will keep me going until the next day which is all I could ask for right now.
njbg6k,,gz7bzc3,Yeah, one day at a time. I volunteer sometimes and going through the process to be a foster for pets rn. Hopefully buying a house next year so I can apply to become a foster parent for humans too. Just trying to make it to the next day rn so one smol thing at a time
njbg6k,,gz7csas,You‚Äôre doing awesome. Hang in there and remember to check in with yourself as well. It can be easy to give everything and not have anything left for yourself at the end the day which isn‚Äôt good either.  Stay safe when you‚Äôre helping. We like to believe everyone has good intentions, and they mostly do but there‚Äôs still predatory people out there who will prey on vulnerable people. This goes for both homeless and non-homeless people.   Best of luck and lots of love!
njbg6k,,gz7hgr6,Yup, very true!! Thank youüíó
njbg6k,,gz8nndo,Great advice!

njbg6k,,gz8mphv,Been doing this for years. Still depressed as hell.
njbg6k,,gzc2lk0,If you allow me to talk to you, maybe I can see what is leading up to this. Most of the time it is lack of money. Is that the case? If it is a neurological problem, why can't you be on medication to manage it? Why can't be on mood stabilizer?
njbg6k,,gzc6ctl,Sure! You can PM me, I love talking. I've been on antipsychotics for many years and have been addicted to Diphenhydramine since I was 8 years old. Also raised by doomsday Mormons and participated in research chemical studies due to my love for the spiritually liberating qualities of psylocibin and LSD. I love me some Jesus but I want to strangle his father.

nh7c1i,gyx0j3r,,I mean if they are ghosts, you shouldn't have to worry. Ghosts don't really hurt people
nh7c1i,,gyz1xdl,Yeah, I agree.  I've heard things before but this was the first time seeing..maybe the aliens are going to talk with me one of these days.
nh7c1i,gyvijzp,,i have done years of research in the paranormal, plus my own experiences. You might be safe in the way that no one else will explore that place besides "ghost hunters" as other people may know about hauntings or whatever and stay away.  tho this may make you a bit nuts being woken up and scared. But if you wish...log the times this happens. it may be consistent. if they looked at you it may not be residual (look up residual hauntings).   side note.: its funny how i watch some yutubers go to so called haunted locations and a lot of times they come across a homeless spot. like blankets, bed, obvious stuff that someone is sleeping there (or has at one time). and all i can think of is: if this place is as haunted as they CLAIM it is in this video, why TF would someone want to sleep here?!?!?! lol. also they say they leave food or water in place if it looks to be used recently.

ngyw1n,gyttyqo,,wait so basically some chick calls you 12 years later and say you knocked her up, your solution is to keep getting in and outta jail while shes getting tied up with some serious plug while banging her when you can? and you're upset this dudes ruining your life after you fuck his girl? taking care of the kid should be the #1 priority here, what about that? dumbass
ngyw1n,,gytvdvj,I had no idea whatsoever that she got married we really didn't talk she would mssg me when she wanted a hookup my son never mentioned it either
ngyw1n,,gyu5ebt,also, you said it was her 18th, how old were you?
ngyw1n,,gzwbd37,He said it from the jump but you just call him names anyway...man...it‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt tell my story
ngyw1n,,gzwdnju,dude I dont judge people, if im giving you shit for what you did its because you 100% did some fucked up dumb shit, homeboy did some fucked up dumb shit and if id call you names for what you did you 100% did too ------- naaaaaah dude I took a peek at your profile, mr "I just spent 250 on a new vape" "looking for recommendations, money is no object", "I dont have a very supportive family, they just like having me around and keep me off the streets, also I'm 24 and ""I run away from home"" but my family always asks for me to come back", out here talking bout "your story",  grow up bro you're 24 still living with your parents and you got a family that cares and plenty of money to get you nice shit when you want it, just for the record nobodies gonna judge you for having a rough road and doing what you gotta do, the only circumstance under which you'll be judged is if you're a scummy person, if you're worried you'll be judged its 100% because you did come scummy shit
ngyw1n,gytywkz,,How spread out is the story? I'm gonna ask a dumb question, what is keeping you in the areas where drug dealer man has influences? Are you in a remote location?  I've not been homeless because of rumors but I've been homeless a ton for the last ten years. So not victim blaming or anything. But when I had nasty rumors in my dumb lil town in bumfuck USA, I left as soon as I could. No more rumors. Lol
ngyw1n,gyv4j3c,,no, youre just psychotic my dude. go seek help if/when you want things to improve, its very unlikely they will until you do.
ngyw1n,,gywaqq6,No you just can't handle reading his frantically natured post and you think yourself something of an expert of human behavior because reddit. So here you are. Making diagnosis of people you've never met based on a popular notion of what could only vaguely be called psychology.   You're an egotistical shit bag.
ngyw1n,,gywcxgn,no, ive been through similar mindsets and would bet anything this dude is just psychotic
ngyw1n,,gywekvj,"I've been through similar mindsets"  That's like saying "I've been angry before he's obviously bipolar"
ngyw1n,,gywfjas,whatever u wana tell urself dude im not gonna argue with ya

ngyw1n,,gzwbgri,Exactly...

ngyw1n,,gyv5qd1,yeah, i do dude. what you said is classic paranoid delusions. this guy isnt chasing you down across the country for years. he isnt tapping your phone. its almost certainly all just in your head.
ngyw1n,,gywaxvo,Sim cloning is actually a common issue. If he had the resources and the technical knowhow he could literally track this dude across the country harassing him. With a million dollar settlement and a drug dealing enterprise, guess what. A 15 year old could do it. Your internet expertise and law and order psychology class doesn't qualify you for shit.
ngyw1n,gyw0uvo,,I think you should consider that your actually experiencing classical psychosis and delusions. It may be hard to see that you are experiencing a delusion. Because a delusion feels real.
ngyw1n,gytpb07,,So you became homeless after you got out of jail or before? I'm trying to understand how your baby mothers BF had something to do with you needing to pack up and leave. Bike riding, drug dealing, settlement winning or not, how does he have anything to do with this?
ngyw1n,,gytq7wl,This PoS kept repeatedly fucking some else's wife and now is upset that he is suffering consequences.  Doesn't care at all about the herpes, seem surprised, or deny being the giver.                 Don't dick other people's wives knowingly!  If you do don't be surprised when you get fucked by the husband too.
ngyw1n,,gytr0yp,I don't have herpes bro  that's the fkd up part she was a hoe and fkd everyone , but she picked me
ngyw1n,,gyxha7u,Get tested for herpes. Send the test results to Biker dude. Proves you arent the one who gave it to his wife.
ngyw1n,,gywa1jq,Dude I would say just stop engaging with them. Theyre pieces of shit who come here to feel better about themselves. That much is clear. You don't waver in what you say, whether you're being 100% truthful idk. But it's obvious they're too stupid to put punctuation in themselves while reading.   For future reference I've actually been testing this for years. If you don't put periods in or reply with multiple replies, people can't handle the frantic nature of it and they get annoyed. So it doesn't matter what you said, they're right and you're wrong and you're insane and blah blah. But if you put periods in and make it all neat and tidy, they turn into totally different people.   This is the internet. Don't engage the shit bags. They'll break all over you.
ngyw1n,,gytr89c,Not hard to see why you were fkn homeless lol
ngyw1n,,gyvudi5,I'm not homeless. Quite the opposite.
ngyw1n,,gytq3rf,He's has connections and he's peddling this pos story that she's selling because she believes I gave her herpes, and I banged her after I got out she got a hotel room
ngyw1n,,gyw00bj,How is this stopping you from getting work? There are very few jobs where someone's herpes status is relevant. Furthermore, most bosses don't listen to bikers.  Could your criminal record be the real problem?
ngyw1n,gytvvnc,,I‚Äôm gonna assume you‚Äôre aware of your mental health and know it‚Äôs not something like that. Since they‚Äôre clearly not gonna stop/change, you just have to separate from them as far as you can. If they‚Äôre SIM swapping your phone (I guess that‚Äôs what you meant?) then get a different carrier with a different number. Stop trying to solve the puzzle and let it go. It will only do harm to you over time. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs taught to ‚Äúforgive‚Äù when you go through abuse.  And someone telling me this has helped me before, so I mean no offense, but the girl and dealer might truly be the insane ones in this situation, but due to how you‚Äôre reacting, on the outside you seem like the crazy one. It‚Äôs probably why nobody believes you. It‚Äôs sad but that‚Äôs how Other humans work when they see something like this from the outside. Doesn‚Äôt help that they like to believe the people who are more convincing (narcissists, the people you‚Äôre dealing with, etc.) over the person who‚Äôs clearly in distress from something.   Hope that makes sense I‚Äôm pretty high  Btw how sure are you that it was actually your baby.
ngyw1n,,gytwsmk,This is the best answer ever Ty üôè it's been hella hard bro , and my mental health totally took a hit , but I'm recovering and have started taking steps to protect myself , I'm a total empath sadly and  I seem to invite this type of person smh , but Ty sincerely for this response .
ngyw1n,,gywaizt,If he put punctuation in there and made it neat and tidy people wouldn't think he came off as insane. It's the worst on reddit but it's all over social media. When people get angry they reply with a lot of replies or little punctuation. So they see someone else writing without punctuation or with lots of replies and now that person is unhinged.   I've tested it for a long time. People aren't as smart as they think they are, or sane. So jumping someone's shit for seeming unhinged feeds their shit ego and makes them forget how pointless it is for them to be on social media for all their free time.
ngyw1n,gyu4nxu,,Hey no offense but first just get some Mental health help, so u can be there for your kid, and find some community resources that may help u find a hotel for a mint night or two like salvations army so ur kid doesn‚Äôt see u as a mess or mid episode (maybe why some of those things weren‚Äôt shared with you from him given ur current state which is evident from the wandering loosely connected drivel written above). But there‚Äôs always time and Once you have your mind back, you‚Äôll be a fine father and make better choices. Good luck.
ngyw1n,gyuh1fv,,you seem to have posted in r/psychosis before about having psychosis
ngyw1n,,gyuwhzw,I had complete nervous breakdown
ngyw1n,,gyweypb,Gotta love these data miners who don't actually read what they're "researching"   It's gotta feel sooo good to go through people's old posts trying to make yourself look smart to strangers because so many people do it.
ngyw1n,,gywr7am,? My point was that OP is unwell. Nothing of this story is believable and reads as psychosis
ngyw1n,,gywtt5r,A lot of it is quite believable. It reads as psychosis because of the frantic nature of how it was written. You're making a diagnosis of someone based on a reddit post and a degree? One would think, but someone qualified to make the diagnosis would have a lot more to say and wouldn't be making a diagnosis on this basis. You don't know what you're talking about, so why talk.   Even if this was pure psychosis it's so within the realm of believability that even people who should believe him might be more inclined to be aggressively non believing. A million dollar lawsuit for a controlling drug dealing herpes gettin husband of a shady shitty wife. Sim cloning. Harassment. Slander. A ruined relationship. If he actually is diagnosable it would be all the easier to make him a target and the more likely scenario is that he actually is being targeted but is also mentally unwell. This is why people can have video proof of gangstalking and still be deemed psychotic by those they seek help from. Because it mimics the symptoms. Even if this husband isn't smart enough to do all that, what he appears to be doing inherently discredits a mentally unwell target if they speak up about it. And all you need is some basic access to some public records to find out where people are working, living, what people online are saying about them. A job opportunity could easily be ruined by some google bombing with a laptop.   People think they know. Way too fucking much.
ngyw1n,,gywuhq2,It is not at all within the realm of possibility. Since when do drug dealers track your every move from city to city for sleeping with their girl? Claims he's straight up being followed  i'd like to see actual proof anyone's ever been gangstalked
ngyw1n,,gywuobo,There's plenty of proof. You literally just have to Google. He slept with the dudes wife and they all got herpes. You don't have to follow someone around to hack their life either. And it's be safer than outright killing them. Not to mention you're thinking nickel and dimers. Not actual dealers. You're dangerously ignorant and mentally unwell simply for your pure lack of imagination. I'm guessing your passwords are super easy to brute force.
ngyw1n,,gyz4m87,In a nutshell this
ngyw1n,,gz02g9q,It'd be the ultimate revenge. It's not even believable to the general public.
ngyw1n,,gywwxpl,No they aren't. But believe whatever you want
ngyw1n,,gyz4ceg,I literally just went  through therapy üòÉ saw a shrink and everything and I'm perfectly sane but thanks for your input ü§°
ngyw1n,gyy0ad0,,Don‚Äôt let some puta drive u to homelessness 12 years later no word? Ur not responsible, I mean who she think u iz ...forest Gump..nah fuck that hoe !   be homeless for other reasons ...
ngyw1n,gytxrjx,,you seem nice
ngyw1n,gytp7bh,,Hope one can your circumstances get better.
ngyw1n,,gytqkf7,I'm reaching out to victim services and a lawyer actually , women can say whatever they want and nothing is there to protect men it's fkn insane how easy it is for someone to ruin someone's life
ngyw1n,,gyweuh9,Seriously. It's about as easy as it is to downvote someone on reddit to feed your ego.
ngyw1n,gywbaxm,,Good luck dude that sounds like a fucking nightmare. Gang stalking is the hardest thing to prove because in this country mental illness is THE diagnosis and everyone's an expert.  You'll make it. At this point I would drop all my electronics, setup any new devices with alias accounts, use whatever services you can find, get back on your feet.   I'd say it's possible you're deluded but there's too much detail and nobody has that much specific detail about gangstalkers.
ngyw1n,gz46qnj,,Bullshit
ngcafw,gyq7414,,Aren't most cities trying to make benches an inconvenient place to sleep? To keep the homeless away?
ngcafw,,gyqf7lk,my city took out the benches at train/bus stations, now the pregnant/elderly/people with health condition have to stand and wait for the bus/train for 10-20 minutes  these fucking heartless assholes who makes these rules or pass these legislations :(
ngcafw,,gyun94n,The pregnant/elderly people already had to stand and wait for 10-20 minutes because the homeless were sleeping on the benches.   Now, at least the pregnant/elderly don‚Äôt have to see/smell/interact with them.
ngcafw,,gyqajn4,exactly! the idea with this bench is actually to counter that because hiding homelessness doesnt get rid of it. This bench, according to its creators, should serve as a transition tool for the homeless between the streets and their own place. It could also be used as shelter support.
ngcafw,gyq2llr,,Looks like a coffin

nfp07y,gyqh32o,,My concern is this will not stop those willing to complain. It will just alert them to look for and report the tent(s).
nfp07y,gzxj6kw,,Fucking bullshit. They will never understand the feeling of being homeless or having a loved one be homeless. Shit makes me furious
nfp07y,,iql1f4e,Most of them are either psychopaths or too stupid to realize that they are two missed paycheques away from being right there!

nfp07y,gyorcfu,,Yeah my favorite are the asshole people on this subreddit who take pictures of people's tents and post them on here. It's pretty fucking rude.

nfp07y,,gzlb5s9,As a homeless person, I do not shit on walls. Thanks.
nfp07y,,hc5q92o,This happened to me as a dumb kid in N√©e York working at CafeColonial on the Lower east side. A roughed-up, disheveled older gentleman asked to use the restroom and I said yes because saying no seemed wrong. And yep‚Ä¶he left a disgusting disaster that I cleaned up. On the walls too. I don‚Äôt remember what I felt at the time (prolly not thrilled obviously), and have never faced that situation again. Alas, sassafras, ugh-brown fountain ass!

THANK YOU, THANK YOU LORD, but also because life isn't about Me, Me, Me. You heavy hearted people, if it was you think JeSus would have  feed the hungry, give drink to those who are thirsty give so they can drink.    Some of y'all better be careful how you talk to people, and always be mindful that JeSus also said be careful you entertain strangers ( your thoughts words actions and deeds ) Jesus said this, and he ended it by saying because you could be entertaining angels üòá unaware.   One more thing it was also talked about in the bible Jesus ask someone something and Jesus said but yeah I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, thirsty and nothing to drink  I can't tell No one how to spend their money but if someone asks you for some dollars and says they want a soda or something and you say ok man just don't buy no beer or Liquor and they ok. If you give it to and do the  opposite of what they say. Oh well that's on them. You gave it from your heart with good intentions. Anything else is on them.  Lastly if you do something for someone you don't have to record it and put it all over social media. Lastly Jesus did say it ain't everybodys business dont let your left hand know that the right hand is doing.   Lastly the Lord said you bless them secretly and He'll reward openly.   Have a Wonderful üòä Day everyone, and Incase you never see or never hear from me again. Be safe be blessed, Merry Christmas and Happy Near Year to you and your Family. From me and mine

nfatm2,,gynss68,oh man i cant even imagine how much easier wouldve been to use wifi with a vehicle. i remember last summer i sat outside starbucks on some stairs overlooking a parking lot and would just sit for hours as the battery drained. a few times it rained and i tried to stay dry using a patio umbrella, with mixed results. 5/10 experience but pretty good wifi signal

Where do you live? What kind of weather have you endured through the years?

nbm8rb,gy3ca2b,,I'm not proud of it, but I had quite the run of lifting from Walmart and dollar general when I was particularly down and out. I never did it for fun, it was always a matter of survival.  Something of an unwritten rule...you never steal from other individuals. Big corporate stores? Do it if you gotta, especially if your life depends on it.  You *never* steal from another person out on the streets, but not everyone is gonna have that mentality (and those people are total dicks, I might add).
nbm8rb,gy0cm5j,,Yeah of course. I've been tempted. When I was street homeless I found a guy's wallet with some cash in it and crefit cards. I was really hungry at the time  but I used  a business card in his wallet to track him down. He met me and got it. Didn't offer me a dime and I didn't ask.   Week later he saw me sleeping on the subway and realized I was homeless. He was flabbergasted that I returned his wallet intact. He asked me why I just didn't keep it. I told him that wasn't how I was raised. Turns out that $$$ was the last of his pay that week and his credit cards were pretty maxed out.   He asked me to go up with him, took me to White Castle and bought me some burgers. It was the most he could do. Later he and his wife found me on the train again and they gave me more food. They were nice people and I was glad I did the right thing.   That was actually the second wallet I gave back intact during my time on the street.The first one the guy was so broke he barely had $7 for lunch in there. He was so grateful he hugged me.   A lot of people would have kept those wallets. I was admittedly very tempted but I just couldn't. I have had my own wallet stolen. I know what a bitch it is to replace the stuff in it and to lose what little money I had.   When it comes down to it my conscience overules my growling stomach every time...
nbm8rb,,gy1ddln,Good on you for doing the right thing even under the most harshest times. You never really know the back story on people until they share them with you.
nbm8rb,gy06oxg,,Yes  I have no qualms about stealing.. I don‚Äôt steal from other people though or other homeless  It seems like everyone wanted to turn a blind eye and look the other way when I was being abused or harmed.... so they should continue to look away and turn a blind eye while I steal  I remember I loaded up a bin of stolen goods from a major chain store with survival stuff, clothes, makeup, bras/panties, shoes, chargers etc... and stole the bin to go with it.   I‚Äôve done countless fraud as well   I have absolutely no regrets  But stealing is a very divided topic amongst the homeless
nbm8rb,,gy06vvk,Ah ok, thank you! Is it ok if i use you as a statistic for a school project?
nbm8rb,,gy07niw,Yes sure.
nbm8rb,gy0ks7r,,I have contemplated it, but I have yet to do it. The reasons why I have yet to do so:  ‚Ä¢ I don't have the skills and cool-headedness necessary to get away with it. Even though I have a lot of inside knowledge of how different security measures work to catch thieves, I don't have the actual skills to thwart such measures consistently enough not to put myself at significant risk.  ‚Ä¢ I'm currently stuck in a small town environment where everybody knows me. Currently, they don't mind me and leave me alone. If I were to get caught stealing, that might change, and it could create a lot of trouble for me.  ‚Ä¢ While I have no moral qualms about stealing from most large corporations, the government, or individual people and small businesses who are shitty ‚Äî I do have a problem with stealing from individual people and small businesses without a specific issue that would justify stealing from them. That disqualifies a lot of the most vulnerable potential targets.  If I could learn some slight of hand, and how to pull it off in front of a camera ‚Äî and if I could move around a bit more so I wasn't just staying in one place ‚Äî I would potentially do this as much as I could get away with.
nbm8rb,,gy1q8q9,Unless the theft involves a very low probability of detection, the value of stolen proceeds is unusually high, or some favorable combination of both, the risk/reward equation involved with most thefts rarely justifies the effort.  Today's society condones and is much more forgiving of quasi-legal theft, such as overbilling a wealthy client, than it is of shoplifting of essential foods and medicines. Weird but true.
nbm8rb,,gy1v4tq,The risk/reward equation is considerably different when you don't have food to eat. Marginal utility is a thing, and very relevant to the relative value of the particular merchandise for the person in question. That is, the potential reward for stealing a $1 package of hot dogs is generally much higher for the person who hasn't eaten in a few days ‚Äî than stealing $100 piece of jewelry would be for someone kind of getting by. Likewise, the person who already doesn't have enough food to eat has a lot less to lose than the person kind of getting by.
nbm8rb,,gy372x2,Probably out-of-scope for the current discussion but there is a psychological "cost" to stealing which is often overlooked. Even if the theft is successfully executed, the thief may experience significant guilt and remorse, above and beyond the actual economic value of what was stolen.  EDIT: Unless the thief is a sociopath and lacks a conscience about their actions.
nbm8rb,,gy4f4n4,Or unless the thief has a sincere internalized conviction that stealing is morally permissible or right in that instance. And, any society where systemic poverty and systemic oppression are so prevalent, or individuals are constantly being robbed of their social and economic self-determination ‚Äî there's a strong argument that stealing the basic necessities of life from those who robbed those things from you is moral restitution, no different than taking back property that was stolen from you from a thief, or collecting damages from someone who injured you.  There was a time when I had moral qualms with such things ‚Äî but that time has long passed. Decades of being the most morally sensitive and conscientious person wherever I was, while simultaneously getting screwed by the people I was trying to respect through such morals, kind of broke me up that. I have learned that for such a paradigm of respect to exist, it must be mutual ‚Äî otherwise, it is not only self-destructive, it's harmful to the others being hurt by the same people and institutions hurting you, because it's enabling behavior toward those people and institutions. I have a lot more weight on my conscience for having enabled them in the past then I think I would for stealing a loaf of bread.
nbm8rb,gy05fuy,,I'd recommend using some sort of survey disclaimer to explain your purpose up front, and I'd recommend nobody answers surveys or study questions without knowing the purpose. Your school project will be more professional for it and you'll build trust with those who you seek info from.
nbm8rb,,gy06imk,Yeah, but this is reddit, and it doesn‚Äôt really matter as i still have to interview people. I‚Äôm just going to use a number, unless if people allow me to actually quote their story.
nbm8rb,,gy0a09z,I don't necessarily mean for legal purposes, I mean for trust. I'm surprised you'd get any answers at all, let alone anything useful for your project, but it is what it is, I'm sure it doesn't matter
nbm8rb,gy1xh1d,,Hell yes, I have stolen to survive.  Often went into Wal-Mart and grabbed a box of Milky-Way candy bars and ran out...before security could catch me. But I was desperate at that time... no jobs... police harassment when I panhandled...but Im much better now...I have a full time job with free meals.
nbm8rb,,gy2031v,Realistically, at least where I live, security and cops rarely arrest anyone who steals from a big store like Walmart or Safeway or target, unless it‚Äôs something hundreds of dollars. I had an ex friend who stole thousands of dollars of alcohol over years from two stores and never caught. However I recently was accused of stealing for walking around with a small drink obviously not from that store and leaving soon and not getting anything and it was so awkward and they treated me like I just stole $100 of stuff and I didn‚Äôt take anything. (I‚Äôm not homeless or look it aside from occasional sleep in car nights) this store is more independent and probably upright. And I don‚Äôt steal aside from rare necessary occasions
nbm8rb,gy06fms,,I contemplated it all the time, especially when I was tired or angry. But I never did. I'd rather starve than steal. I was lucky to be in a country where a day of collecting recyclables made enough money to survive, though. And that I was able-bodied and could handle hours of lugging glass bottles around. But if you don't have the option to make money and there are no places offering free food, then you don't really have a choice, you know? If that had been the case I would've only stolen from big chain stores, never from small stores or regular people. The big chain stores can afford it. I don't feel like I have the right to steal from regular people, because they might be in a situation just as bad as mine, and me stealing from them could ruin their whole week just like if it was the other way around. Just because I feel like shit doesn't mean I should make someone else feel shit. Unless it's literally a life or death situation, like a tarp from a garden if it's raining, obviously you have to do everything to stay alive.  Most other homeless people I knew didn't steal if they could avoid it. Either because it made them feel guilty or because they felt like they could/should do better. Or because of the risk. Lots of us have moral standards!
nbm8rb,,gy06ptu,Ok, thank you! Is it ok if i use this in a statistic for a school project?

naj3a3,gxv37t3,,Is there any way for the land it is on to be legally rented or bought just for what's there and a little more space to expand if it needed/wanted to? It sucks that the city will eventually tear it down.                            I'm homeless in New England right now. I'm lucky to be at a fairly safe and tolerable place. Beds are open from 6pm to 10am with lunch and dinner brought by volunteers from the soup kitchen.  They are slow to move on help but I have a safe place for my scooter, a bed and big locker, and I work 4-10pmish 4 nights a week which they let me use the shower when I get home which is a lucky/rare exception. I managed to stay sober after a two day drunk when tossed on the street last Sunday.  I was here winter of 2019 until February 2020 and was stumbling drunk all the time, unemployed,and just getting fucked up.  I think they see a big change in me. Over a year sober, 2 day hickup on the street but staying sober still now and working.   It's hard as fuck. If I didn't have my scooter/job I don't know if I could do this, especially the staying sober part.  I feel a small amount of hope. I'm also applying for SSI. I'll get like $800 a month which sucks but would gauruntee no more being homeless.  I have Chronic Major Depression, PTSD, Anxiety disorder and ADHD. Recovering Alcoholic++. On my breaking point. I cry or feel nothing. Usually it's nothing.  I keep hearing about all this extra Covid money and see people getting places paid for for a few months up to a year.                Sorry for the randomly placed verbal diarrhea. I'm just holding on by a thread ATM.
naj3a3,,gxx5a3v,You are doing great! Hang in there. Sobriety is not easy and you are doing it homeless. The pain and strain will lift for you. Keep doing what needs to get done. Love and hugs.
naj3a3,,gycawzx,It‚Äôs not the city that will tear it down, they are located on land owned/maintained by the State organization CalTrans. In my opinion that is a good thing for them. I was homeless in San Jose, a little south of Oakland, and I always preferred to live on CalTrans land. At least in my area they tend to be one of the more tolerant agencies when it comes to the homeless. As long as you don‚Äôt trash your spot, you don‚Äôt create some kind of hazard, and your housed neighbors don‚Äôt file complaints on you, they mostly leave you alone.
naj3a3,gxu5l3f,,This is really cool. Oakland is an amazing city!
naj3a3,gxtz1aq,,I want to donate some first aid kits and canned food if it‚Äôs allowed...
n93zn0,gxlugdo,,I mean, that‚Äôs not totally a solution, but I get what you mean. For temporary relief, sure. I have a pretty bad cavity rn where my filling fell out, luckily I found somebody who gave me lidocaine for the mean time.
n93zn0,,gxlvtg0,Not a solution to the infection, but for me it's completely killed the tooth pain on each experience I've had Benzocaine does nothing for me at all, even Orajel won't work
n93zn0,,gxlwhz2,Ahhh man. Yeah, I get that. I may test out your method cause I can‚Äôt afford to go get my tooth ripped out currently. It‚Äôs like a black hole and the pain has moved up my face.  Sympathies to anybody dealing with tooth pain or just pain in general out there tho.
n93zn0,,gxnyhi0,One thing that will work is garlic capsules... they will kill the infection and stop the pain. If you don‚Äôt have insurance this is a great option. You can get a bottle at Walmart for about $3.50. My mother recommended this years ago, I was in excruciating pain and I actually got angry bc I didn‚Äôt believe it would work but the pain was so severe in the middle of the night, I was desperate so I took the garlic pills that she left me and they actually worked.
n93zn0,,gxpdbin,Garlic doesn't kill all bacteria. I've tested whole garlic, ginger, clove, and coconut oil against dental issues. You can definitely kill some layers of skin with garlic and clove, but any hopes that herbs would address an infection inside a "repaired" cavity is unrealistic. But I haven't tried wormwood, green walnut hull, or other strong antiparasitics. Chewing on clove and brushing with it definitely helps subside some funk, but it won't seep under a filling into the center of a tooth at the root where all those filling toothpick things were shoved.
n93zn0,,gxqkxwc,For me it worked well enough to stop the pain permanently... it may not kill everything but it is definitely a great option if you don‚Äôt have insurance and cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I was between jobs at the time and the garlic capsules were a life saver.
n93zn0,,gxtrbe6,If it's that effective, that's pretty incredible. For the sake of quality, it would probably be worth sourcing the main active natural ingredients as tinctures to get at it further. What's the brand and product name?
n93zn0,,gxzptgi,I apologize for the late reply. I use the Spring Valley brand from Walmart. It really does work, I was irritated when my mother suggested it, but the pain got too severe and I was desperate so I took them. It took a few hours but it did work and the pain did not come back.

n93zn0,,gxmuehk,Wow I'm such an asshole I was just about to rudely comment "Clove doesn't work for me" But who tf am I, I completely forgot this was a tips post!  I guess everyone is affected differently! Crazy what might work for you won't work for me. Man tooth pain is the worst. (I am in a better place in life js so no one worries nothing is wrong) but I've gotten suicidal thoughts when I had a bad tooth infection. It's no joke, and you go to the ER for help, they label you as a drug seeker and send you on your way + your medical records are forever labeled "drug seeker" so goodluck getting help when you need it most. Never even touched Drugs besides Weed in my life lol  Edit: Also I'm very sorry to hear that your wife had to go through that. I would buy a jar of the Red Cross stuff as an emergency anyway, I always have a bottle just incase. I'm sure you know, your good day can turn into a nightmare if a tooth ache comes on.
n93zn0,,gxmvgad,I remember last time she had a cavety she was crying for like 2 days straight and her whole face was swollen. She went to the ER and they treated her like she was a literal heroin addict or some shit, which by the way you shouldnt treat like a monster regardless. But that clove oil shit worked magic but hoo boy did it stink. It really made me angry because I know if we had money we would of been treated like actual humans.
n93zn0,,gxmvvwu,I'm so fucking sorry... I really really am. I know what that's like. Fucking horrible. We can thank the people who abuse the ER to get drugs. This is actually a major problem going on rn in America, my girlfriend's mom has SERIOUS back problems and has had surgery multiple times, they don't give her anything for it, all she can have is medical marijuana because she used to smoke weed to help with the pain. Rediculous, really. God forbid I get into a car crash, me simply seeking help at the ER for my tooth will end up making it so they'll give me Tylenol and that's it. Fucking ridiculously sad times man. I walked in literally CRYING and had to keep water on my tooth or else I would literally shake/pass in and out from the pain. They gave me a shot on my ass cheek and when I looked up shot in ass for tooth pain, so many posts came up about how it's just to make you not come back to seek drugs anymore. -_-  Clove oil smells so bad hahahaha! Glad it worked though! Don't get angry at yourself, I know what you mean and would probably feel the same way, It can cause ptsd type issues the way they treat people in need, it's really horrible. Again sorry your wife was treated that way.]  Edit: This is why we see people who let their serious medical issues go because of things like this.
n93zn0,,gxnvvkt,The ironic thing is my wife takes suboxone so anything they gave her for pain would not of have any effect
n93zn0,gxohfst,,Might have been said in this thread already, but clove oil and ibuprofen help with the pain, but it's only a temporary solution. Once you develop abscesses, it can easily turn septic and go into your brain. That shit is fucking *fatal*. I had 27 bad teeth removed, which wasn't a fun time, but it would have killed me if I didn't. Dentures ain't fun, but it's better than being dead.

Bite it lightly with the tooth thats in pain and after 10-20 minutes pain will have left for good. Try some good tea brand if possible, the commercial ones like Lipton are weak. Personally me  had the luck to have access to some natural Lithuanian tea that I think could easily beat novocaine in pain killing.
n93zn0,gxodnb8,,Clove oil on a cotton ball, placed over or in the affected tooth
n93zn0,gxpjkgz,,There are generic brands of this everywhere, including 99 cent stores.  Anytime you have fever, vomiting, chills, go to the ER. Don't mess around with infection.
n93zn0,gxom4cf,,This stuff works wonders but after awhile my tooth got so bad that this stuff stopped working. Probably used it too much but that's a sign you can't wait any longer to get it pulled.  And dental school might be your only option without money. If it's a molar like mine was, they call that oral surgery and a regular dentist will refer you to one which cost me a cool $600.

n93zn0,gxwaszm,,That's awesome, thank you for sharing that my teeth are okay, but I don't have dental insurance so again thank you
n93jhb,gxlsgsr,,Short answer, no. long answer, also no, but like, many homeless folk who have turned to drugs do so to numb the pain of the very traumatic way they have been forced to live, you shouldn't judge em for that, and folk who are playing you are actually few and further between that the news would have you believe. I was homeless for years and only met two people who were clearly scamming, one was pretending to be disabled and the other was pretending to be a veteran. So like, if you feel like someone needs it and you are willing to spare it, just do it, or if you feel uncomfortable with that you could always ask em what they need.     (I'd also like to point out that when folk get concerned about providing money to folk that they think will spend on drugs, your thinking is counterintuitive, they will still get the money for drugs, but do you know what they won't do? eat, buy clothing that they need, replace needed equipment. Because the fix ends up taking priority,)
n93jhb,,gxlsw40,Sometimes what you need to get better is kindness, understanding and help that is unconditional. The only reason I am off the streets now (for 2 years now) is because a couple took me, my partner and my dog in, let us live in their office basement and gave us access to get on the housing register, get some work etc, they never expected a thing from me, they gave someone they knew had a history of drug use live in an office with ¬£mils worth of equipment, they gave us trust and respect, treated us like humans. They gave us the platform to actually make it (I was homeless for a LOOOOONG time before this)
n93jhb,gxmree1,,Short answer is you can never know. But ponder why people (especially homeless people) might be on drugs. I know that there's a lot of people who just enjoy getting high but I also know that there's a lot of people self medicating because they can't afford a doctor/dentist. Personally I used to drink whiskey to help with dental pain. I didn't want to be drunk but when you're left with no other options what can you do. People are also emotional creatures, some people do drugs as a way to escape the guilt of their past and such. I'm not saying it's good to do that I'm just saying it's understandable. Everyone has their own fight to fight.
n93jhb,gxlxies,,Actual travelers who walk or ride around the country will almost always have big hiking packs with all their possessions. Theyre more likely to use cardboard signs with a touch of humor. Usually younger kids. A train kid is very identifiable. Bibs, pack, dogs, face tats, alcohol. Help them get drunk if they offer you jokes for smokes.  Homebums and people that dont move city to city will usually be older and have a cart or plastic bags. City type trash  I never givr money to people with no possessions with them. It tells me they have a safe place to go.  Theres always food and dog food (for dogs). Just give that  If you need help spotting drug addicts, that just comes with experience. You can read all the symptoms and descriptions you want. Youll want to think the best of people and theyll exploit that. Its human nature
n93jhb,gxm0w7b,,Most folks sleeping outside are not using drugs. Any quick tricks to spot someone with Substance Use Disorder are going to be prejudicial.   Ultimately giving money to anyone sleeping outside, especially folks with SUD is a good idea because if they don‚Äôt get it from you then they‚Äôll get it somewhere else. You could be helping them not commit a survival crime, maybe them getting five bucks from you stops them from breaking into someone‚Äôs car. Now we have someone whose car didn‚Äôt get broken into and someone who didn‚Äôt have to risk legal trouble.   Keep in mind only one in ten folks experiencing homelessness are going to have the sort of barriers to housing that keep folks on the streets for longer than one year. Of those one in ten, some experience SUD, some self medicate severe mental health problems with substances, others have other unrelated barriers to housing (legal, etc). All are worthy of your compassion and a few bucks.   Ultimately the only way you can think about it, if after reading all these replies it‚Äôs still something you‚Äôre worried about is that a few bucks will always help someone, especially folks with SUD, but statistically it‚Äôs very unlikely you‚Äôre giving money to someone with SUD.
n93jhb,gxnzsr6,,Instead of giving them money, you can offer them food especially a home-cooked meal would be nice. If you see their hands are dirty you can give them some wet wipes to clean up or buy them a new pair of socks. Or any other item besides money that you think would improve the quality of their life. I've offered to buy a homeless person food before and they said no they wanted money instead. When that happens it makes me think that person just wants to use it for alcohol or drugs instead. Be careful when a homeless person stands outside a restaurant and begs for money for food. I've experienced that before and after giving that person some money, he said the exact same thing to the next person and didn't even go inside to grab any food. You can tell him, ill go buy the food for you, but don't hand him the cash unless you don't care how he uses it.
n8lx85,gxj8vl3,,there was a bunch of posts about a bile in different  places. One of them was my favorite like a bike in between a sign that said "Hard Place" and a boulder.

n8lx85,,gxj9gwv,Wicked panhandling idea, friendo

n8lx85,,gxjcw70,yeah, it's the same where I am too.  so my suggestion is to make a reddit group, or find a reddit group of the city/Town  you're in.  start posting picture of your bike in different places, or save it in your phone photo.  make the title of the post to be like i.e.  "A Biking Tattoo" in front of a random tattoo shop, post it (this is only if they ask for proof), then ofc do panhandle or whatever and if someone coming up to you and tell you to go away just say you're doing a series of posts about a Bike in different places for fun, job, requests  whatever.  "unfortunately.....it doesn't pay and your bike really need some work but you just simply don't have the money."   That would be a reasonable excuse for your panhandling, plus you got proof of you doing that too (the reddit post)  reason why cop might not harrassed you for your excuse. It's public exposure of something like that, and cop don't really want to be shown as the bad guy. but then again....Idk if it's true like that, it could be or not. do your own testing.

Housing costs too much everywhere in the country. Just having a job isn't enough to get housed these days. It is estimated that a single individual needs to make more than $22 an hour to rent an average apartment in every state in this country.
n8iznt,,gxivu4c,Thats where your wrong. Rent is not that bad here and people everywhere over spend and do not know the difference between want and need. I didnt even come close to $20 an hour when i got my 1st job at walmart only made $9.50 an hour and was able to rent a 2 bedroom apartment cover all utilities and save up to start my garage.   I could see needing $22 an hour or more to live in cali or nyc but not everywhere.

We will see who has better results   ‚ÄúWhether you think you can, or you think you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre right‚Äù
n8iznt,,gxixx37,Me cause i have friends all over and invest in properties myself. And not to mention i have helped a few homeless already in finding a place to live at an affordable price.

n8iznt,,gxixfxn,Exactly! I live in pa and yes there are some areas (mainly the cities) that charge pretty high in rent but for the most part a 1-2 bedroom house rents out for around $750 a month.
n8iznt,,gxj8qmj,I make 20+ an hour, live in central pa my lease is up at the end of June. My current apartment is 1350 for a 3bd 2.5 bath. I have a prius with 2 more years of payments at 400 a mo(car insurance factored into car payment for easier maths) I'm early thirties and would like to finish my degree so I'm not stuck in a factory. When I go on CL I see studios for 900-1200.... Any studio priced below 700 just screams scam.  When my lease is up I'm gonna be carcamping. I need an accountability buddy, someone to hold me accountable towards my goals. I'll lose the electric bill, rent and the internet bill but will mostly be cooking with a propane stove. I could definitely use a budgeting class.   I still owe restitution and student loans, my wages will be garnished whenever the covid restrictions that stopped them start back up.  You show me a 2 bedroom for 750/mo and I'll worship you as a deity
n8iznt,,gxjb33e,https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/765181017468388/  https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/292043385751343/  https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/146177980503468/  About 30 more listed also, after 20 seconds of searching.
n8iznt,,gxjbsp9,What did you enter to get those results? Ive never seen a sublet on fb marketplace. I'm south central pa. To be fair those are all in state college. A giant college town for pennstate I'm sure they have cheap rentals for summer sublets. I need something an hour or less from where 30 meets 83
n8iznt,,gxjetjy,Just click housing on marketplace.   I don‚Äôt even list anywhere else these days.
n8iznt,,gxjfep4,No idea where 30 meets 83 , I‚Äôm in Wisconsin
n8iznt,,gxjg5eq,https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/3772455772853504/  Start worshipping üòÇ
n8iznt,,gxjgufn,Last time I trusted the city I lost it all. Moved in during December three days later my mattress and clothes were a loss. The LL refunded my rent so I wouldn't bad mouth him and I don't he claims he didn't know the bedbugs were there. But his maintenance guys said to me this is the fifth time he bombed em. Ever since I stay out of the city
n8iznt,,gxjj0y6,Well, then you are choosing to fail by being too picky ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
n8iznt,,gxjjoxe,Not by being too picky I'm still on the lease here til end of June. I would much rather rough it in the car for a few months til I find what I'm looking for. I respectfully disagree is all. Do you know that bedbugs and cockroaches carry increased rates of diseases and sickness? Do you know how hard it is to find a roommate when your mattress becomes home to the bedbugs? I value the long play over the short comfort
n8iznt,,gxj98w7,I currently rent a 6 br 2.5 bath lake front house for $1,300 a month with a boat house and a private pool in my back yard
n8iznt,,gxjaad2,Can you share how you found it everything on the apps is too much(Trulia, apartments.com) craiglist is like pulling teeth trying to separate the real listings from the white tower listings  I've been driving through Glen rock and Shrewsbury areas trying to find rental signs from owners
n8iznt,,gxjas8h,Lmao craigslist and trulia and the like are where you will get scammed or pay way over price for rentals. You have to put in the time and drive or walk around and look for rent signs and check local fb listings but also if you do fb dont pay anything until you can walk into the property and be shown around. I almost got scammed by one of them but then they wouldnt show the property red flag right there.
n8iznt,gxj90ig,,Look more north eastern or south western pa lol central pa is one of the pricier areas
n8iznt,,gxj9ki8,The job that pays is in central so do I add four hours to my daily drive and move two hours away? Can I get the same pay in south western or north eastern? I have friends in Philly and Pitt so many of whom are living out their cars right now. Some of these people have master degrees and can still only find jobs paying less then 65000 a year.
n8iznt,,gxjaacj,Then your friends aren't budgeting right either. And you are probably looking at the wrong types of property. My sister is in Philly highschool drop out and is still living good in her apartment. With a savings account and still going to school for medical something or other. Dont remember the fancy word she threw at me.   But no you dont have to move you just need to really sit down and look your budget over again. If you want dm ill hook you up with a budget and house hunt. And get you a list of properties in your area you can afford.
n8ml7i,gxjikat,,Talk with him. Most of us out here are simply ignored and could just use an ear sometimes. Being on the streets is hard enough to begin with, but it's so much worse that you're treated like a blight on society. Find out what he really needs, and do what you can. Like all things in life, communication is key.  Edit: thank you for the silver, kind stranger. Much love
n8ml7i,gxmsb42,,I was homeless in my youth too. I'm 18 now but I know how it is. If you talk to this person be aware that there's probably a big reason why they might be homeless. For me it was usually me trying to escape abuse foster homes and system. Try not to talk too much about why they are homeless but focus on what they want for their future. Especially at that age when they have dreams that haven't been broken yet. I used to have a dream of going to college for industrial technology. Ask about hobbies and if there's anything you can do to help them with those hobbies, stuff like supplies for art ect. I can tell you that if you push them to go to a shelter ect it's possible you may not see them again.
n8ml7i,gxl5tak,,talk to them ,see if there is anything you can do to help ,check they are okay and if you can afford it maybe give them a few dollars
n8ml7i,gxji6ie,,If you are sure he is a minor, you can call the local authorities. He could have run away with no where to go, have no way of understanding what it means to be alone and how to get help, be a missing child, possibly have a mental illness. Maybe the guardians even kicked him out. Local authorities can help to provide guidance and get the help needed, including helping to get the child a social worker. Hoping he gets the help he needs, and thank you for wanting to help him.
n80meo,gxfydpe,,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through all this. I hope you start feeling better soon
n80meo,,gxg8q3y,Me too, thank you for the well wishes.

n80meo,,gxg8o8m,Thank you.... I really appreciate that.
n80meo,gxg7rr2,,I'm sorry that you're going through this horribleness. I hope it helps to know that this won't last forever. If possible, can you try to get Pedialyte/electrolyte powder to mix with your water? It will help with your energy and recovery.
n80meo,,gxg8lzi,I wish I saw this before heading to Walmart... I got vitamin c pills, and vitamin c lozenges. And crackers. Thank you. Heading back to sleep.
n80meo,,gxh1j6t,If you can get any salt from the hotel then you can mix some salt in your water as well.
n80meo,gxgicw3,,Ahhh mom. Happy Mothers Day üíê  Sorry you‚Äôre feeling harsh. Sending you well wishes and speedy recovery. Get some deep restful sleep. :)
n80meo,,gxisbg1,*smiles softly* thank you for that. :o)
n80meo,gxhmutl,,I‚Äôm sorry that you are feeling ill. Rest up and take it easy as much as you can!
n80meo,,gxitbos,Thank you, I'm trying!
n80meo,gxgm9ll,,Where's the rest of the "anymore" story? Or does "anymore" just refer to the rest of the night?
n80meo,,gxishbr,Yeah, sorry ....  the /s stands for sarcasm. Yes, not homeless anymore for the rest of the night, since I got a motel room.
n80meo,gxgt2ne,,Happy mother's day. I hope you feel better by now. Take care of yourself.
n80meo,,gxismrj,*smiles softly* Thank you so much, I am trying. Dog is thrilled that I can't eat, she's getting the chicken lunchmeat I bought.
n80meo,gxgylpq,,Chin up. You got this
n80meo,,gxisrom,I'd rather  keep my chin down kind of in a fetal position for the next week until I get rid of this. lol... but thank you, just trying to be funny even though I don't have that gene,.
n80meo,gxicmwz,,Oh my gosh, sending positive and healing thoughts your way. I can't imagine how much you miss those girls, you ARE a mom and even though I know it sounds ridiculous with how hard things are for you right now, I do want to wish you a Happy Mother's Day.  I hope so much you feel better soon. Please try to keep hydrated and get a little food in you.
n80meo,,gxiurox,Now I'm seriously bawling, thank you .... the most important thing in the world to me was being a great mom and to have them ripped away from me was SO hard. At first I was just crying like crazy reading your comment, now I'm just back to feeling kind of numb and hopeless. Shit more sobbing. I don't know how to just "be happy that I had them in my life for a little while" or whatever else some people might say to get me to feel better. The fact that I'm bawling now more than ten years later .... I'm never going to "get over this".   The older girl, Kristen, just listened to her mom and stayed away from me. I mean by phone ... physically it was easy since they lived two hours away, mom had full-custody, we just had visitation. I was never able to speak to her again or see her.   The little one, Katie ......... bless her sweet, loving heart. She was what I think is called a "latch key" kid? When she got off school she went home and let herself in. She'd be there for 2-4 hours alone before her sister or mother came home. She would call me, thank God. I spent a lot of the time bawling because... well that's just me, and I couldn't handle never seeing her again any better than I can hendle it now. But there were these stuffed animals at the time that had an online game you could play as well. So we played that online stuffed animal game while we talked on the phone every school day. I feel stupid admitting it, but she was kind of more the adult ..... she wasn't breaking down losing her shit about losing me. She just took one day at a time and made the best of it, until .... fucking ugh :(:(:(:(:(:(::(:(:(:(:(:(:( she stopped calling. I tried calling when I knew she'd be home alone, but no answer. Hells bells why can't I get over this .......... I guess she finally had to listen to her mom and stop talking to me.   I miss you like crazy, sweet Katie. I see your pictures online, and desperately hope that you are as happy as you seem. I love you, sweetheart.
n80meo,,gxixps8,I bet they think of you more often than you know. You loved them and they felt that everyday you spent together.   You can't get over this because how can you get over losing family? Your feelings are valid. Cherish the beautiful memories and remember you helped shape them. Who knows what the future will bring?   I'm sending so much love your way. Xoxo
n80meo,,gxjba95,Ahhhhh thank you so much. I hope you are right. I worked SO hard to make a difference in their lives.   Damn bawling again .... ugh. I do cherish the memories I have. A computer technician "oopsied" on my portable hard drive five years ago and mistakenly erased my entire life history. I didn't mind so much losing my personal and professional history.... writings, resumes, all evidence of my life and experiences....... but that was also where all my photos of my daughters were. All our family photos. When my ex took off, I couldn't keep any hard copies - everything was digital. And then in minutes, every single bit of that digital history with them was gone.   Sometimes I wonder if it's a good thing, because I know I would be looking at each and every photo and laughing and crying, since the photos would bring back my memories. I have serious memory problems as a result of trauma.... so it's hard to find memories without something to trigger them.   I can't tell you how much I appreciate you writing this. For understanding how/why I'll never heal from losing them. Having a panic attack and struggling to breathe right now just thinking about it and one memory that popped into my head.   I did help shape them .... thank you. I know that with all of my heart. Shit I gotta log off.   So much appreciation and gratitude ... thank you!  oxoxoxoxo
n80meo,gxil33h,,Hey girl...I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôre feeling so bad.   I‚Äôm spending my Mother‚Äôs Day alone too, wishing today would pass. Thinking about you! *hugs*
n80meo,,gxivbui,HUGS I am so sorry you are spending it alone... I hope you are at least able to talk on the phone. Desperately wishing today would pass too .... cussing at the tv and everything else that says "happy mothers day" is getting old. I just want some peace. I want to just rest... with no demons attacking me while I sleep. .
n80meo,gxjaa80,,Oof, been through a nasty stomach bug while I was in a tent out in the woods. Not. Fuckin. Fun. Really hope you feel better soon. Pedialite or gatorade really help if you can afford it, as long as you can keep it down. Keep hydrated and rest as much as possible. Well wishes, friend
n80meo,,gxjbfuo,Yeah, I am going to get some if I can get back out to a store. Thank you so much for the well wishes, truly. I am going to take them right back to bed with me and rest some more. Hugs :o)
n80meo,,gxjca6x,Anytime, just keep up with the electrolytes. If you feel your head spinning like crazy, find a way to get to an ER, even if you gotta get an ambulance. Severe dehydration can kill you easily. Just be safe, please.
n80meo,gxim7vc,,sorry mamas. stay safe <3
n80meo,,gxivl1z,<3 <3 <3 From one princess (online name way back in the good old days) to another, you too. Thank you for commenting.
n80meo,gxi2fzi,,You probably have covid
n80meo,,gxivgka,Honestly that is what I think too .... but I already had it once. The odds of having it again are so slim. I never recovered completely from the first time having it, damn sure hope I don't have it again.
n80meo,,gxkhho0,One of the guys at the shelter this winter did have it twice, thankfully before coming into contact with everyone.  He had some other health issues going on, so maybe that opened him up for reinfection.    Stay safe.  Get a test if you can easily find one.
n80meo,,gxo0ieu,Yeah, I need to find a test locally. Not puking anymore, but I still feel like crap, am so tired, and hurt SO much. Breathing is hard too, and nothing tastes right.   Unfortunately I have other health issues than can make me more susceptible.... happy happy joy joy.   I so desperately wish I could become an alcoholic or a drug addict. I know that sounds stupid to most people but I desperately need "less".... my biggest life dream is a tank of nitrous oxide and a mask.
n80meo,gxxwbwf,,Hope you've recovered by now, and that you managed to stay in the motel. That's heart-breaking about your kids.
n7y1i1,gxj7fji,,You ain't alone, don't give up. Living like this gets absolutely fucking frustrating and it'll beat you down if you let it. If you need to rant, rave, or just need an ear to bend, feel free to PM.
n7y1i1,gxxzzz0,,Just saw the post that got you harassed. People are ridiculous. Rule 7 of this sub: "**No judging**."  It's probably not worth the abuse for you to post along those lines again, but I hope you score some more good food.
n7y1i1,,gy0f57n,I'm doing ok, taking the break was what I needed.
n7y1i1,gxhws5e,,Please Jessie, don't go throughout that path... I think its time to say goodbye to the nature and seek help... Go to the nearest town, panhandle. Try to get some money for a motel room... Take a nice hot shower.   Start using the internet to find jobs and gigs.   Don't let your mom win... Don't let the world win.
n7y1i1,,gxmdh8e,True.. Very True
n7y1i1,gxfnpvb,,Nice.
n6h3ka,gx7dbo1,,Congrats! May things continue to improve for you
n6h3ka,,gx86lvr,Thanks! The trajectory has certainly been only up for a few weeks now and I'm undyingly grateful for the opportunities with which I've been presented
n6h3ka,gx7g77o,,Amazing!!!! Congratulations!!!!
n6h3ka,,gx86qv1,Each day that I wake, I will praise I will praise. Each day that I wake I give thanks I give thanks
n6h3ka,,gx9upip,Hah, reminds me of one of my ex favourite groups, medicine for the people, before the unfortunate truth came out against the lead singer.  I'm so happy for you and I know things will keep rising for you!
n6h3ka,,gxbcs4a,It's hard to separate the art from the artist.... I know that many people have found inspiration and love in this music and that is a positive thing.
n6h3ka,,gxbg5bj,It really is, I'd been following them since Through Us. Slowly regaining the power to separate the music and artist.
n6h3ka,,gxbnik0,It gives a lot of interesting perspective and new meaning to old lyrics as well... We all need the strength to overcome our transgressions and be better and that strength comes from community
n6h3ka,gx7jjp1,,Looks like a righteous spot!
n6h3ka,,gx873je,More than I ever could have hoped for! I am lucky to have a van to sleep in so I waited patiently for a place close to my job which is in an extremely competitive housing market.  I spent many hours on fb marketplace, craigslist, and Zillow and what finally did the trick was to post an ad on nextdoor explaining my situation.  First time using nextdoor. Would recommend 10/10
n6h3ka,gx7cxtk,,Congrats!!
n6h3ka,,gx86obe,Thanks! So happy to wake up to the sound of roosters crowing and not in a pool of sweat.
n6h3ka,gx7krnp,,Hell yeah happy 4 you,should feel proud of yourself!!
n6h3ka,,gx87mnn,I feel more proud of what I've done in the last 2 months than most anything else I've done in many years.  It feels great.  I'm part of a killer restaurant team who are all in the same boat, bringing a professional big city edge to a casual laid  back vacation spot.  We get the same 30 or 40 locals practically everyday and 4 or 5 times that on the weekends
n6h3ka,gx84krl,,That looks gorgeous!
n6h3ka,,gx87x30,Thanks! I didn't get a chance to actually move in until about 5am and watching the sun rise on the back porch while the roosters crowed and the horses began to meander almost brought me to tears.  So blessed.
n6h3ka,gx8uo89,,Congratulations!
n6h3ka,gxa84am,,You made it!
n6h3ka,,gyxzukq,Thanks for the cheer bootydong!
n6h3ka,gx8ztmc,,I'm green with envy but very happy for you. Enjoy!
n6h3ka,,gx9744n,I did not manifest this alone. I'm pretty sure there were like 7 or 8 people all simultaneously helping me think it into fruition and I am just exploding with gratitude for my fellow humans, just trying to make it through another day or month or year with a smile. Or second.  We lift each other up and I want to be in the position to lift others up.  First project is garden, then carport.  What would you like to manifestempissmith?
n6h3ka,,gx9dxqm,A couple of years ago HRA sent me to this place on E23rd and while it was a bit small otherwise it was fine. I didn't get it at the time because I didn't have my disability. Now that I have it they aren't sending me any place. It was like a little studio with a bathroom and a kitchenette for under $300. Affordable housing right around the corner from my hospital, doctors et all.   At the time I went with 4 women. All of them walked out. I didn't. I stayed filled out the paperwork. I didn't care how small the place was. I just wanted a home again. That's all I want now. That place I wanted it so bad and they let me think I had it too.   I can do the rest but I need a real home and I've honestly been looking to the point where I am exhausted. All the stuff you're supposed to do I've done it, looked there. But even my shelter admits they can't really do much.  Just want to manifest that place or some place like it so my kitty and I can finally be home...
n6h3ka,,gxbcby6,I want to see the post where you got your home for you and your cat . I hope it's coming soon and sending good thoughts your way . I know from your posts and comments that you are super smart and resourceful and will find something . It is crazy how hard it is to find housing but if anyone can do it you can .
n6h3ka,gx9z149,,Horses are beautiful! I always had horses and just watching them can be so peaceful.

n5peck,gx3gdbq,,Wow, that's awesome.  It's unfathomable what a mood picker-upper something like this can be when you're really down in the dumps.  I'm glad such kind people are still out there!
n5peck,gx2m1zx,,that's nice
n5peck,gx2s5e4,,Yup, good people are out there
n5peck,gx35qp1,,That looks SO good AND nutritious. Yay to kind strangers everywhere, we love you!!!
n5vkpe,gx46yib,,Just make sure you didn‚Äôt make it obvious from the outside that you went in, so as to not draw attention from others.  Be careful in the future - your ‚Äúfun urban exploring‚Äù can risk people losing their only safe place to sleep.
n5vkpe,gx3q3kf,,Best case is just to leave some money there. You can add a little note if you wish. Encouragement and words of kindness are always appreciated.
n5vkpe,gx5g25p,,Try to remove any evidence that would indicate someone is coming and going from the outside of the property. Meaning if you moved debris aside, put it back where it was to the best of your ability, if you opened doors or windows close them, etc. Make it look the same as it did when you found it. You might leave a brief note explaining why you were there and that you don't intend to alert LE, otherwise they might be too afraid to return in case they assume the intruder was a cop or some kind of security. And if you do leave money or a gift card obviously put it somewhere like under their shoe or in their sleeping bag so it's not out in the open.
n5vkpe,gx6gczm,,Well you were trespassing and so are they.
n5vkpe,gx3q3vg,,Best case is just to leave some money there. You can add a little note if you wish. Encouragement and words of kindness are always appreciated.

n5vkpe,gx4n810,,Not saying this is a laughing matter. But those ghost hunter types on YouTube come across homeless camps, I've only seen I've or two say they give them food or cash.   I used to stay in a place like that too. But nothing haunted. Lol.
n5b5fj,gx1e52g,,When I was on the streets I always made it a point to avoid most of the crowded areas. I never saw the point of being angry or aggressive to people if I'm asking for food. Only good that will cause is getting the cops called on me
n5b5fj,,gx8lzcq,Right. I have literally had ppl screaming at me for.not giving money or cigs.  I understand there is mental Illness, but for real I'm a poor single mom whom was homeless. I don't need that shit. Also, I do help homeless in my area irregardless of what I feel. K, venting. I'm sure rich ppl karen's r the same
n5b5fj,gx0i58z,,I feel for people that are truly struggling, but the entitlement of some, and the actual danger of trying to help are real.
n4sqab,gwxjm47,,Whenever I get money, I'm still so hesitant to treat myself because I feel pressure to squeeze all the mileage I can out of every penny. I'll buy the cheapest foods that will last me the longest ‚Äî potatoes, rice, eggs, maybe some oatmeal if I can swing it.  But the psychological benefit of just splurging once in awhile cannot be overstated. I rescued a perfectly intact bacon cheeseburger from a dumpster a few weeks ago, and it was SO good to have one again! Last week I managed to finally get some food out of the food pantry ‚Äî they gave me a bunch of perishables I couldn't keep long, so I had an excuse to gorge myself on meat for 3 days. I had ground beef, "McRib" style pork patties, a rotisserie chicken, and a whole pizza. I stuffed myself silly trying to use it up before it went bad. I was quite sad when it was all gone. The nutritional benefit aside, it just felt SO nice to eat like a real person for a change, even if it was just for a few days.
n4sqab,,gwxmmf9,I‚Äôm exactly the same way. It was really hard to just splurge, not worry about the $, and not even use my app to get some sort of freebie/deal!

n4sqab,gx1b6u8,,That‚Äôs genuinely a kind thing to do, not only for the obvious, because the way she approached you and interacted with you was on a down to earth way, not shove money to you and run away. Sometimes the interactions, not contrived,  makes a person feel visible

n457p8,gwu3103,,Uggh, yeah Delta 8 CBD actually has a small amount of THC in it.  I don't know about K2, that could be something unique to the product you consumed.  Anyone who has to be drug tested for work or housing should tread very carefully with these products or probably just avoid them altogether.
n457p8,gwv3fep,,I live in a legal state and have made my own cannabis extracts for ~4 years.  Delta-8 is made from Hemp that still has a low amount of Delta-9. Depending on the sensitivity of the urine test, it is very likely Delta-9 will be detected if you consume Delta-8. Because the technology is so common, count on Delta-9 being caught.
n35dcx,gwnxzh1,,I hope he is alive, and if he isnt i hope he is in a better place now. I dont have much to say but stay strong, take your time to grief and try to get past this.
n35dcx,gwod2pr,,Did you know his last name, approximate age, maybe city of birth? Someone on r/genealogy might be able to locate a death certificate (or other information).
n35dcx,gwnldm5,,My heart is breaking for you. How sad, how incredibly sad but at the same time, how beautiful that despite it all, you were there to care for him. He was loved.

n3847e,gwo9r1b,,Are we going to have to go thru all of this again?
n3847e,,gwogz8h,lol, just sharing my good fortune.  Been awhile
n3847e,,gwotelp,Right on, but prepare for the hammer to drop once again.  A second round of snatchin' probably isn't going to fair any better than the first.
n3847e,gwp9rkl,,Three weeks ago you almost ate a rat, two weeks ago you ate a squirrel, now you're turning down beef but taking raw chicken? I guess I don't understand your logic.
n3847e,gwqshwf,,If you had asked first and they told you to go fuck yourself, I could *maybe* see a justification for your actions. But you didn't, and just stole from people you deemed to be 'too fortunate'. I bet if you approached them nicely and explained your situation, they likely would have shared some food and supplies with you willingly. Especially if like you said, they had much more than they needed.  Not everyone is a cold hearted shitbag, and you convincing yourself they are doesn't suddenly give you the right to steal from them.
n3847e,gwooj19,,Same shit. Different Day.
n3847e,gwp67w9,,So you're a thief.  If someone pulled that shit on me they would be in jail!! Actually they would be in the hospital, then jail.
n3847e,,gwpva67,So you sound like a pretty horrible person, you want to beat up a homeless person for stealing food and then you want them in jail after you get your kicks in.
n3847e,,gwruu47,This person's solution to homelessness is literally "Well have you tried renting an apartment" üòÇ
n3847e,,gwro89w,If someone steals from me I have no problem having them arrested! It has nothing to do with getting my kicks in it has everything to do with protecting my property! If someone came up to me and asked for food I would be happy to give them some. If I find someone stealing from me I will consider them a threat.
n3847e,,gws7ity,Right so you think stealing a bit of food is worth being sent to the hospital, you threaten in the other thread to shoot someone if you caught them stealing or having your pit bull attack them. This has nothing to do with stealing some food and everything to do with you being a horrible person.
n3847e,,gwtxk8x,No it has to do with someone being a thief,  and bragging about it. Ask for food, it will be given to you. Steal, face the consequences. Where I live everybody has a gun and a big dog.
n3847e,,gwuvwfx,Hey fam, homeless people are treated like shit by 99.9% of the population. They barely get by because of violence and shit alike. Asking for them is a bigger risk because more often than not you might strike on someone that's nasty. And if you really think killing people is a solution then, sorry but you need therapy.
n3847e,,gx0617y,Sorry, but being entitled will get  you shot I've been homeless, and never stole from ppl. This is a drug addict mentality.  Homeless for yrs. Amazing how many drug addict homeless ppl think cause their poor they can steal from others. Oh you hungry, just steal. Where  I live, u shot. Poor u, homeless, so steal. Fuck that. I.was homlessy, never that low.  On my feet now. Fuck entitled Homeless that cause their poor they can rob and steal. No wonder Cali is a shithole  Try that where I'm at  Oh..when. I was homeless. The biggest thief's were homeless drug addicts.
n3847e,,gww1wmc,I never said anything about killing someone. The fact is there are homeless people that get violent if you don't have cash on you, I've been spit at for offering food. Again politely asking for food, is fine. Stealing isn't and because homeless people do get violent when they don't get their way I would be on the defensive immediately if I caught someone stealing.
n3847e,,gwrv95t,My guy, if you can afford to bring filet mignon on a camping trip I can unequivocally assure you that a starving homeless girl is not in any conceivable sense a "threat" to you.
n3847e,,gwtwz0a,Well I'm a girl not a guy, so if someone is going through my things I am going to feel threatened. I have a child and if I feel threatened I will do whatever it takes to protect us. Again if someone told me they were hungry and asked for food I would be more than happy to give it to them. And yes I do carry, I do have a pitbull and that person would have been in bad shape if they tried that with me.
n3847e,,gwvqoow,>Well I'm a girl not a guy  It's an expression lol. A colloquialism. "My guy."  >It was not discarded, it was stolen. A person stole from people that needed that food for themselves. If had been thrown out that would be completely different!  That is not the impression I got from the OP; the post makes it seem as though these individuals left the items behind. If you have evidence to the contrary then please provide it.  >And yes I do carry, I do have a pitbull and that person would have been in bad shape if they tried that with me.  It's honestly laughable watching someone bragging about their shotgun and their pitbull and then simultaneously claiming to be threatened by someone stealing hamburger buns. Either you're a big ol' badass with a gun and a dog and we're all supposed to be impressed by you, or you're a baby-clutching victim - pick one.
n3847e,,gww18hz,What part of the post made you think it was leftover. They blatantly said the took some things and not others. And no one leaves a bunch of steaks.  I am a badass with a gun and a single mom I never said I was a victim. In fact I made it clear I wouldn't be!
n3847e,gwtxs2b,,Oh and most people aren't as nice as me.
n2nh8p,gwkfizp,,Hi! What a generous offer! If you aren‚Äôt getting takers here, try r/UKHomeless.
n2nh8p,,gwkg8d2,That's true. But I know there are loads of struggling people in here.. I will wait until Tuesday before offering to send it to UK
n2nh8p,,gwn6xw0,Contact P.A.T.H on Facebook. They'll be in Dublin in an hour and could probably meet you. They feed the homeless on Sunday's and deliver food, clothes and tents to the homeless community.
n2nh8p,,gwkgc35,[deleted]
n2nh8p,,gwkgy9s,1 is absolutely enough. I am actually surprised that no one is interested. I know Dublin homelessnes scene a tiny bit.. But there are a lot of people and they all (more or less) have phones, visit forums. Maybe redit is not a thing here..
n2nh8p,,gwkiizr,Oh wow! I didn‚Äôt realize.
n2nh8p,gwpa7nw,,Brother lukes or cappucin centre will take them. Dublin Simon runs the statutory Outreach team (ie, official help for rough sleepers) I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd take it. They used to when they were just needle exchange.  Merchants Quay would likely take it as well to give out to someone sleeping rough.   When I worked in roughsleeper outreach in Dublin very few of my clients sourced stuff like this online and deffo didn‚Äôt on reddit. Was all through drop in centres or outreach so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs why you‚Äôve had no uptake. If you leave it with one of the above services, it might not be given to a person today but will definitely be handed out if someone has to rough sleep unexpectedly or has their current tent vandalised or robbed. :)
n2nh8p,,gwpdkfh,Thanks a lot for detail explanation. Will do tomorrow or on tuesday
n21suc,gwgxai8,,Upvoted for visibility.and enjoy your travels.
n21suc,gwh0gog,,That's nice of you, hopefully you can help someone out. Enjoy your trip
n220y6,gwkp38w,,Oh, Think Twice, It is...
n0i0cu,gxfqbhz,,I know this much: It's bloody complicated to go through any legal system as a victim.  The skepticism is caustic.    Usually homeless people can find food without having to resort to stealing.  But that food  comes from the city, from places in the city.  Foraging, in a forest for instance, is certainly possible, but one needs quite a lot experience before depending on it.
mzv11w,gw39954,,Check out r/vandwellers and r/urbancarliving
mzv11w,gw34ygs,,Fill it with your stuff, drive the hell out of the Slabs, make sure to take a jugging can, and go to Olympia, WA.  Get off at exit 109, and make yourself at home in the Park n Ride lot right there at the exit, on the Olympia/Lacey line.  There is free WiFi from 6 am until Midnight, less than a mile away at the Timberland Library.  There are two locations in downtown Olympia, a straight shot south from the Park n Ride, that offer free showers and laundry.  Within that same three block span is the food bank, a clothing bank, and a soup kitchen.  There are multiple pot stores in both directions from the Park n Ride lot, if you are of that mindset.  The Walmart is just up the road in Lacey.  Why this Park n Ride lot?  In Washington, the Park n Ride lots are under the control of the DoT, which puts them under the patrol of the state police, and not the local police.  Each Park n Ride lot in the state has to have the rules of the lot clearly posted at the lot, and online.  The rules differ from town to town.  In Olympia and Lacey, the Park n Ride lots have one rule... no vehicle can be left unattended for more than 48 hours.  According to two of the officers who patrol the lots (once a week), living in your vehicle legally constitutes "attending" to your vehicle.  \*I\* lived in that lot for just about a year, and had multiple conversations with the staties who patrolled the lot... not because they ever knocked on my window, but because I flagged them down when they came through, to talk about the lot.  What does piss them off, is when someone comes through with a camper and takes up like 4 spots, or parks perpendicular to the spots at the edge of the lot, taking up multiples.  Otherwise, if you aren't trashing the lot, and your vehicle can move, they don't care how long you stay.  EDIT:  And... the weather will be VERY nice, compared to spending the summer here in the Slabs.  No one should endure the 120F summers unless they either want to, or they have no choice.
mzv11w,,gw6uscf,Great info, thank you for the post. I‚Äôll write it down and be sure to check it out when I hit the road
mzv11w,,gw73neu,I mean... if you've already got a potential destination in mind... this info is pretty much useless.  However, if you've got a vehicle and a burning desire not to be burning in the Slabs in a month or two, and you've got no destination in mind... Olympia can be a nice summer spot.  You've got the Olympic Peninsula to go and play in, and day trips to Seattle, etc.
mzv11w,,gw76njz,That is, by far, the best/most helpful response I've ever come across. You got anything you wanna share about the Portland area? I been in my Jeep for three years now and still haven't found my go to spot. Sure, I got spots, but nothing like that.
mzv11w,,gwci3fk,ummm... the only time I was in Portland, it was for a month.  I lived in a "hotel" across the street from that big book store that takes up an entire city block.  I lived on peanut butter sandwiches.  But... I had a train ticket to take me out of the city at the end of the month.  I was... exploring at the time... kind of.  You are mobile, so... at first search, the TriMet park n ride lots have a 24 hour rule.  You can park for free, overnight, for no more than 24 hours.  So.. just to avoid undue attention, you'd likely be needing to spend a little gas, and rotate through the lots, never staying in one of them overnight twice in a row.  They do say that all the lots are locally managed, which means there *might* be specific rules at each, but from what I'm reading at the TriMet site, and they do get specific on each lot, none have any specific rules stating that sleeping in a vehicle is prohibited.  Remember.  Solar panels on the roof, and parking under big lights at a place like Walmart, means solar power at night.  If the East Portland Community Center, or the Matt Dishman Community Center & Pool are open, you've got access to free showers.... but this is important.  Start making the rounds to the soup kitchens you can find.  Some of them also offer services like free laundry and free showers.  I can't name any off the top of my head, so I'd have to start looking up shelters that state they have free facilities regardless of whether or not you are staying at the shelter... but soup kitchens are difference, since there are no overnight stays.  Likely, I'd have to go immerse myself in Portland on the streets, to get a better picture.  I was there for a limited time, in a limited capacity.  I read a shit-ton of used paperbacks.
mzv11w,,gwd1qg6,Don't fret. That is excellent advice! I had no idea about Trimet, and since my vehicle is my apartment/work truck I'm not interested in posting anywhere for more than 12 hours. As soon I wake up I scoot. This is great for me! I'm not looking for a place to camp, just a place to feel safe when I sleep. I park in some sketch areas, not because I'm sketch, but out of respect. I don't wanna bother my "neighbors". This puts me in some less than reputable areas where I can't relax my guard. If Trimet is accustomed to the practice they will have no issues with me, I'm a "leave no trace' boondocker. When I leave, there's no evidence I was ever there

mz270j,,gw3o4pv,Do you have the Labor Market information for the career path you are on? For me clients that show the most commitment, flexibility, and initiative are the one's that succeed.
mz270j,,gwzqhk6,Can I ask you a question please? Can they see if you have a job? I hear if you make too much you‚Äôll get denied
mz270j,,gwzr5e3,Yes, if you make self sufficiency wages, you probably will.  I'm not sure if it's a universal thing across all programs, but it's hard to justify training if you are already at the goal.
mz270j,,gwzrxw9,Right! So my question is.... If i just don't tell them i'm working, will they know? I technically am on unemployment im just not getting any money right now due to the fact that my previous employer appealed it.
mz270j,,gwzs9gm,We want to help. It's best to be straight up. They do what they can to make it work. Calculate your income to see if it's at self sufficiency. Figure out the income of the end goal position. Is it worth it to hold on to what you have, or connect with the long term goal?
mz270j,,gwzsfls,so i make 12.50/hr working full time and even get overtime....  but my bills are:  $400 car payment  $250 insurance  $400 medicine   $100/week for food   $50/week for gas   &#x200B;  do you think id make too much if i put that down?
mz270j,,gwzsoun,Which state? In Cali with a family size of one, that seems doable. You still fall below self sufficiency.
mz270j,,gwzt9qj,I‚Äôm in South Carolina and I‚Äôm a single male :/ Watcha think lol and btw thank you so much for your input!
mz270j,,gwzu0tl,Found something dated april 9th that states you would be over income. Jeez $12,880 for a family size of 1. Given that you are working, you wouldn't qualify as an adult, dislocated worker, or under employed.  What's the career path you are looking for? How much does it pay? You are roughly $25k a year right now.  How old are you? I took the military route personally to get access to education resources.
mz270j,,gwzuvn9,Yeah.... it‚Äôs crazy right?! I‚Äôm 27. I‚Äôm currently a CNA and want to be a nurse. Will they call my job and verify that I make a certain amount or will they just go by what i tell them? I also tried joining military but couldn‚Äôt because of seizures :/

mz270j,,gw0i6zy,People can't handle it because they don't like not having amenities like showers and bathrooms readily available, they don't get much respect from the public, food choices are often bad, and you don't see family much.

mydjwt,,gvuoc7l,Animals do judge you if you for example steal their food or start beating them and attacking them... They will still hold a grudge if you for example attack them constantly... and they would definitely hurt you if they felt like it, for example if you were passed out with an open bloody wound.      The difference is that people cannot live with these desires or impulses because the law blocks them from getting away with their animal instincts... If a Lion or a tiger kills you, those animals won't face any charges or jail time
mydjwt,,gvuvvsy,it isnt judgment, they are defending themselves or their family or home. and yeah, physcially hurt but for food, not for kicks.
mydjwt,,gvv3x9l,> it isnt judgment  It is judgment, they are judging you as a threat ... They need to judge you as a threat or as an ally in order to defend themselves from you
mydjwt,gvuo6b2,,Sounds like you have a true friend. I hope you don't get cold feet before she comes. When we're feeling low, we don't want to disappoint our friends, and we underestimate how much they care about us.
mydjwt,gvug0gw,,hey thats good ,your luck is changing for the better   (meanwhile on your last post world war 3 still rages on)
mydjwt,,gvuiv3t,lol, I can imagine. Lots of trolls out there going anywhere they can for attention.
mydjwt,gvuj28f,,I'm glad you have someone in your corner! What things had you said that worried her?
mydjwt,gvuduiz,,Glad to hear this! ‚ÄúGood‚Äù is relative; and ‚Äúgood‚Äù to someone with a stable home life isn‚Äôt the same as ‚Äúgood‚Äù to someone disenfranchised. Hell, on this sub whenever someone is still eating, breathing and free that is ‚Äúgood‚Äù!   Sounds like she means well. I hope you have a nice meeting!
mydjwt,,gvulebj,Thanks, we have been through a lot, she is like the only one who really understands me, or understood me. It will be good to see her, I did miss her but was glad life got good.  She is so nice and deserves all the good that can happen.
mydjwt,gw879ip,,I've been following your story for a long time (how can I not, you're like a mix of Survivorman and Dr. Dolittle with strong writing skills).  Trust your gut. You say she *knows* you. She reached out to you. If her messages didn't give off any vibes of desperation, meeting her would probably be a good choice.   You're a strong person. Present yourself to her as such so you can calm your fears of the possibility of her having you committed. She can't if you don't give her a reason to. I don't think she will, but wtf do I know. Let's say that is her plan and she wants to use the messages online against you. Say they were a  fictional writing exercise, calmly excuse yourself, and leave.  Boom, your worst fear about meeting her has lost its bite and you now you have the power to leave if it goes that way. Which again, just seems like a stretch that's what's she's doing.  I wouldn't get too mentally high or low about this. Don't expect the worst or the best. Expect a friend and build off of that.  Good luck J! Let us know how it goes.
mydjwt,,gw8vh39,That's a good idea...in my heart, I know she won't do bad, just my paranoid brain messing with me. It's just, I'm finally settling in, getting used to everything here, and the rough time is behind me, I know what it takes to survive. I'm happy with myself, happy with my life and seeing her might just bring up all the old memories of things I put behind me.
mydjwt,,gw9almq,Well, you know, they already have. And they would. She's a piece of your past, which is surrounded by exactly what brought you to where you are now. But the thing is, you can shape the conversation. You can take charge if she starts bringing up things you don't want to talk about. Let her know that *you* know exactly what she's about to say (if you get that feeling) and say you're a different person now. That you appreciate her, and are looking to build away from that. If she's earnest and your friend, she'll respect that.  But, if you're talking mentally, and you don't trust yourself you won't fall back into what you left behind by being around her, then that's a different dragon all together.   Thing is, you have the tools to guard against that. Especially for a first meeting. If you sense yourself going that way, you have the opportunity to remove yourself from this interaction at the very start. Has to be at the start, because I understand the trap of falling back into old habits. But you can control what's happens before it begins. And no one knows how bad or good this will go.  You have a place to go back to. This meeting might be a chance to alter your path. And you're in control right now.  You alone know your best path. From my ignorant viewpoint, I just think life will be easier if you return from complete nature in a way you feel safe doing so. And a true friend from the past might be able to help. If she can. Again, she might just be saying hi and leaving. But even then, that'll show some people can be trusted. And with your experience and strength, that might be all you need to expand your mindset in regards to what you can accomplish.
mxtr91,gvravy4,,Well, some people camp out in society rather than use shelters.  Take a look at r/homelesssurvival  Also, some resources that are copied/pasted:  https://www.coloradocoalition.org/fortlyon  https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/lxkhr2/hello_i_found_this_incredible_online_resources/
mxtr91,gvrdlxw,,Where are you located? any other shelters available???
mxtr91,gvrlqfl,,Shelters are the worse. I had to say "im poor, im not a criminal" to every employee in there. They would patrol between the beds all night like a jail. It sucked
mxtr91,,gvs2kbz,You know I know that sucks, but I actually would feel safer to have staff guarding me all night so bad things don‚Äôt happen.
mxtr91,,gvyjt4w,They arent really guarding you, at all. They are more often than not, the ones causing most of the problems. Im not a criminal, Im poor.
mxtr91,,gw0grg2, know you‚Äôre not a criminal, but plenty of them in the shelter system. I‚Äôm sorry man
mxtr91,,gwmmqfo,Thank you, I appreciate that.  We have to do better as humans. This is all so unacceptable
mxtr91,,gwmrit9,Yup
mxtr91,gvrruzt,,This is why I open squats or find nice cozy hidey-holes.  Fuck a shelter
mxtr91,gvsdbg2,,Shelters today use the same process and protocol that was created in the early 1900s, which was designed to temporarily give a traveling working-class male a few soup based meals and a floor/cot/bunk to sleep on for a few days as the hobo was.passing through towns in hopes of finding jobs on local farms.  That same overall design, which is largely unchanged or updated,  is now being applied 100 years later to a completely different homeless demographic: opioid/meth/alcohol addictions, schizophrenia/autism/manic depressants, youth runaways kicked out or escaping  abuse/broken homes, and the "lost/dirty kids" that rebel against the modern systems or institutions of corrrupted government, corrupted economics, and as a result: corrupted society. A fucking bowl of soup for someone sick on heroin, a fucking mat on a concrete floor for a depressed and manic schizo, and kick the kids back to the street curb by 6am.  Its archaic, its apathetic, its asinine, and its appalling. Its disgusting, its disgraceful, its deplorable, and its a fuckin disaster.  Theres a liberal slogan that says "homelessness is a housing crisis." And as someone thats been houseless for over 15 years, I understand the underlying sentiment of blaming skyrocketing housing costa that far surpasses annual increae of incomes. However, costs of land and rent only cover about 20-30% of the homeless population in America.  This is the slogan i came up with years ago upon witnessing San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Portland:  Homelessness is a healthcare issue, and healthcare is a housing issue.
mxtr91,gvrjgpw,,That sounds awful. What the points except not being out in the elements. Are there any other shelters in your area or somewhat close by?
mxtr91,gvrrlwc,,Sounds like jail : (    That sucks. Sorry.
mxtr91,,gvs1fzz,Especially with the lockdown (we arent allowed to leave the building except for work or doctors, etc) being in here is literally identical to jail other than having internet. The food is the same, the beds are the same, the staff attitudes are the same.
mxtr91,gvt18ml,,This breaks my heart. I wish things were better, and I'm quite frankly afraid that I'm one bad thing away from this being me with all that I juggle. Whomever you are, I hope something good comes your way soon. Hang in there!
mxtr91,gvs47ad,,Shelters are just concentration camps for people the American government hates.
mxtr91,gvvnbas,,Yeah, I hear ya. I was actually in a long-term one where the staff was pretty good. But with 60 of us and like you said, many criminals, every day there was a conflict: standoffs in the entry way, addicts making tons of noise at 3 am, "rumbles" in the dining hall, confrontations in the shower. Although I met a handful of cool people, after a while, I was like this is gonna f' me royally. Back to living outside, but at least it's quiet at night.
mxtr91,gvvus9c,,I‚Äôve been through about 4 shelters and was sexually assaulted in all of them. This shit isn‚Äôt safe and I don‚Äôt know how people expect us to ‚Äúget help‚Äù from a place that puts us in more danger than just minding my own business on the street.
mxtr91,gw7waxd,,This is one of the many reasons I chose to live in a tent.
mxtr91,gvrtdy0,,I'm sorry mate but your negativity is not going to get you anywhere.  By your definition, it sounds like those workers/volunteers have also gone through abuse and suffered a lot themselves.  To pick a part the only place that is YOUR ONLY SOURCE of food and roof over your head..smh You're the type that once you do finally are able to get on your feet, you're not even going to remember these shelters who was once there for you when no one else was. And not even pay a cent forward as gratitude.  Be thankful instead of insulting the hand that's providing your temp necessities.
mxtr91,,gvs12xt,They are no where near volunteers, they are government employees with bad attitudes. They have a very specific list of resources they read off and if you try to ask them for help in anyway beyond that they look at you like you are crazy and blow you off.   The only person that worked here that was actually nice and tried to be helpful quit after six months for mental health reasons because dealing with the government bureaucracy to try and improve our situation was stressing her out too much.
mxtr91,,gvs3f9i,Flamewolf, your issuses with shelters are legit and valid and  you/we do deserve better. Ignore assholes like slimbone. He's probably never been in a situation like we have and someday karma will catch his ass for trolling and talking shit and we'll see how thankful he is for shit then. Be strong and never settle for less than what you know you deserve and what's right .
mxtr91,,gvs2cw6,That's even worse if they actually work there. I can't imagine the stress they go through having to deal with all sorts of characters that walk in and out of shelters. I can't remember if you put your age. But why don't you enlist with the military. It will open up a whole world of opportunities for you while tour necessities are being taken care of.
mxtr91,,gvtnomm,Ive got problems with my feet so i cant stand for more than 15 minutes without intense pain. Even without that i wouldnt survive two days in boot camp. Im autistic and dont deal well with *just because i said so* instructions and i get stressed out and break down easily.
mxtr91,,gvtykoe,You know I‚Äôm not picking on you or anything, but it seems like in the last 40 years or more a lot of people have both physical and mental problems than much older generations. Past generations worked harder and longer than most anyone today and they still didn‚Äôt have the problems we have today. Just about anyone is autistic or has sever anxieties or other mental issues, and how many many physical ailments. Something is definitely wrong. Babies are usually born healthy, what happens to them????
mxtr91,,gvrxgrq,So you just can‚Äôt fucking complain about being dehumanized at all? Fuck off, the shelter system is awful and the care homeless people receive is absolutely wretched. You‚Äôre also making an awful lot of assumptions. What was even the point of posting this? Seriously, why? Do you think this helps anybody?
mxtr91,,gvs2r66,you're obviously a piece of shit who has never been in this situation and need to keep your fucktard opinions to yourself. FUCK OFF SHIT HEAD!!!!
mxt94w,gvrhu5y,,Craigslist gigs or hit up home depot with a labor for hire sign. Someone will pick him up and if lucky and he works well he may end up with a job.
mxt94w,,gvrj2vy,Ok I‚Äôll pass that along to him.  His mother will probably not allow him at home.  Given his charges, I think it will be hard for him to land on his feet.
mxt94w,gvr9e8c,,Not walmart.  They found out about my step's registration and he was out in his ass. Tho it did take a few months.
mxt94w,,gvrcze6,Is being a convicted felon a game ender for most jobs?
mxt94w,,gvrdnpw,I don't know. I think construction is about right tho. A relation of ours did serious time and when he finally got out he begged his way on as a laborer, hod  carrier and whatnot with some contractor.    Reliable workers are hard to find now and showing up every day is a big deal. But as more migrants come in it may be harder to get hired.
mxt94w,,gvrju7d,And they say, they don‚Äôt take jobs from Americans. Oh yeah, go to most construction sites and you‚Äôll see who works there. Cheap labor and don‚Äôt complain about work safety. Quality work downhill.
mxt94w,,gvrmltv,Yeah I don't know who to believe.  My state is still pretty good about that but I'm only in one place too.
mxt94w,,gvrnic4,I‚Äôm in California and most employees in construction sites don‚Äôt seem to be natives.
mxt94w,,gvrp13y,That's where I'm from so yeah
mxt94w,gvrm87e,,Food and Beverage is a realistic option as well.  No background checks or drug tests in any restaurant I've ever worked in.  With no skills he will probably start out as a dishwasher.  It's a hard, messy job, but it's a place to start.
mxt94w,,gvrmdd9,I will recommend that.  I think that‚Äôs all he could do realistically.  What about housing options?  Will apartments check out his background?
mxt94w,,gvro62o,I don't really know the answer to that.  It probably varies from state to state.  I believe in some cases there are some pretty hefty restrictions surrounding that.  As in he might not be able to live within a certain distance to a day care or an elementary school.  You'd better look that one up.  The thing is, his name is going to be on a public registry that anyone can access.  Even if a landlord is not allowed to use that information they will have access to it.  I would almost be willing to bet that there's some agency or program that addresses this issue.  You're brother can't be the first person to face this.

mwzocd,gvl6yo3,,Also, I find tons of packaged Foods in drugstore dumpsters.
mwzocd,gvm4n9c,,How do you know it wasn't enough to be missed? That's a lot of food.   I plan meals down to the hamburger bun. If someone stole my family's larder before a trip we'd be fucked due to special dietary needs.
mwzocd,,gwglach,>I plan meals down to the hamburger bun.  As do I, I would notice immediately.
mwzocd,gvonycy,,If I had accidentally left out food on one table and electronics on the other, and when I came back just the food was missing, I would feel very happy. You‚Äôd have to be heartless not to.
mwzocd,,gvubq7g,Right.  And, that's very humane of you.  But your feelings of relief and/or joy at not seeing your expensive stuff stolen, doesn't change the fact that theft is wrong.  Sure, we can justify it within ourselves, and say... "I guess someone needed it more than I did" or "It saves me a trip to donate food this week" or "Wow.  That's sad someone needed to steal my food, but I can replace it."  However, we are still justifying a theft.  That doesn't make it right.  It might make it acceptable to you, but it doesn't make the action right or correct.  Let's look a little closer though.  If you did accidentally leave food out on one table, and electronics on the other table, and when you came back you found just the food was missing... would you... make sure you didn't leave electronics out on the table anymore?  Would you tighten your security so that people didn't have access to those tables again?  Would you continue to do things the same way you did before, leaving stuff out that was apparently easy to steal, or would you take steps to make it harder for you to be stolen from in the future?  You might say "Of course I'd try not to leave stuff out in the future." To that, I'd point out that you would be acknowledging that theft was wrong, even when you could justify it to yourself.  Sure... it might make you more aware of the hungry people around you, and you might just leave bags of canned goods outside where they could be taken by anyone who was hungry... but you'd still take steps to reduce the chance of ***theft*** in the future.
mwzocd,,hfuym0t,I would be wondering whether it was a human or an animal that took the food, seeing as how they had no interest in the electronics and just the food. If human, I'd assume they were good hearted enough to leave the electronics and in need enough to take the food. If animal, well they have other ways of getting food don't they? Since I wouldn't be sure which it was, yes I'd lock up the food the next time . But if se hungry person were to walk up and ask for food, I'd 100% want to feed them. So it isn't necessarily reducing theft against people, but against the unknown. Theft due to hunger is not wrong. Fuck that.
mwzocd,,hfv3ash,Theft due to hunger, after one has already exhausted all the food from the food bank, and after one has already spent all their SNAP benefits, and after one has gotten rejected at every soup kitchen in the area...  in other words, Theft of food due to hunger after one has exhausted ALL OF THE FREE FOOD AVAILABLE.... that would be possibly ethically acceptable... it would still be morally wrong.  However, in this case, the OP didn't want to use SNAP, and they don't like going to food banks or soup kitchens, so they CHOSE not to take the free food options.  And that makes the theft of food ethically wrong as well.
mwzocd,,hfybwzb,morality , the way you use it, doesn't seem to have any more use in the real world that some other bullshit theories we learn in school that will never be applied in the real world. Even Jesus broke bread with rapists and murderers,  so I think the Bible might have a more lenient view on morality than you do.  You 're projecting a lot my dude. You haven't considered other reasons for this person not going to a food bank or using snap benefits.  Empathy is what you lack .
mwzocd,,hfyri5j,You really came here spoiling for a fight.  Breaking bread with murderers and rapists, isn't the same as being a murderer or rapist.  I have no empathy for someone who chooses to steal over other options, and then chooses to come here to announce and brag about their crime, about the score that made them happy.  No remorse expressed about what they did.  There is no reason to post about the theft with pride.  What does that Bible say about pride?
mwzocd,gvlvp1k,,OP ALSO POSTS FREQUENTLY TO GET PEOPLE TO FEEL BAD FOR HER AND SEND CASH!!   So take that into consideration here as well.   ‚ÄúAwwwww she was so hungry she stole peanut butter and tuna fish. But hey, she left the important stuff behind, so I mean.... is it really all that bad that she is a thief? Let me send her some money for food so she doesn‚Äôt have to steal it.‚Äù   That‚Äôs the idea folks, that‚Äôs the plan. She‚Äôs damn good at this game and getting paid.
mwzocd,,gvtcho7,Agreed. Shady storyline.  Not buying any of it.
mwzocd,,gvnh0zs,This! OP sounds shady af. Who brags about stealing peanut butter and in the past admits to using hard drugs. Watching people until they leave is creepy af.
mwzocd,,gwgi9j4,There are a lot of red flags on this OP I've noticed.  If you read post history you see contradictory statements like how they never touch drugs, then in other posts talk about partying w meth. If you look at the self photos they include in some posts, it isnt the same person - bodies are different.  Looks like photos found on internet sites.  Sketchy af.
mwzocd,,gx03mh7,Yep. It's a scammer. It's a man.
mwzocd,,gvm1bef,Is there something wrong with posting frequently about being homeless on a homeless sub? Is there something wrong with getting money from generous folks who want to give it? Idk man, I don't get your beef with this.
mwzocd,,gvm44xc,There is something wrong with Bragging on Reddit (scored, while stealing... life smiling on her because she was able to steal) about stealing, to generate sympathy and in turn generate funds through donations.  Don't forget to include the whole "stealing" thing.  You are correct, that there is nothing wrong with getting donations to get by.  You are correct that there is nothing wrong with posting frequently about being homeless.  But for you to PURSEFULLY leave out the whole THEFT thing... that's very, very manipulative of you.  Is there something wrong with bragging about stealing, in a post in a homeless sub?  Is there something wrong with posting about how one successfully committed crimes, in a homeless sub?
mwzocd,,gvmd36a,It perpetuates the stereotype that homeless people are theives
mwzocd,,gvm6y7z,Hmm, here is a hypothetical for you. Someone is about to die of starvation. Would it be immoral for her to steal food?  And a second one: Someone is drinking alcohol during the Prohibition era. This is a crime. Is it immoral for her to talk about how she is drinking (successfully committing a crime)?
mwzocd,,gvmdapr,Dude, there's a difference between stealing food when your hungry and stealing because you are about to die. Stop trying to justify theft. Something tells me if it was your food they stole you would be singing and different tune
mwzocd,,gvnfx8b,I'm pretty sure of two things, at this point.  One... this Snaptastica person isn't going to answer questions honestly.  They keep Redirecting the conversation away from the questions they are asked, while trying to push the conversation in different directions under their control.  Two... there is no way for them to prove their assertion to us that they won't be bothered if someone steals food from them, and they are fully aware of that.  This person is gaslighting us over and over, saying they aren't justifying theft while they are in the process of justifying theft.  They have used Straw Man Arguments.  They are attempting to redefine common words and concepts, the whole Morality Isn't Black And White thing, while they are actually talking about Ethics.  They are attempting to define what actually hurts a person (physical pain - Yes... mental pain - No)...  The Narcissism is Strong With This One...
mwzocd,,gvni26t,Lol atleast he is good at something (being s narcisissit)
mwzocd,,gvnjjjm,I dunno... maybe.  I mean, we pay the really good ones (aka Actors and Performers).
mwzocd,,gvnhtyl,Wow thank you for the psychiatric diagnosis mr random internet man, I do appreciate it!!
mwzocd,,gvnj8pg,You obviously need it.  And thanks for adding another of those Narcissistic protocols to the list... where you attempt to discredit the information based on who the person is that it comes from.  Doesn't matter if I am some random internet man or some psychiatrist... if what I say can be proven through extensive documentation.  And... the techniques you use have been documented and defined by countless clinical studies and in countless medical papers.  I'm just the messenger here.  You don't have to be an aeronautical engineer to recognize a plane in the sky.
mwzocd,,hfuzit8,Are you against murder? Have you knowingly killed an insect? If yes, then wtf man. You must be condoning murder whilst at the same time being against it.  Morality isn't black and white  my dude. That's the reality of life. It's complicated.
mwzocd,,hfvavg3,Murder, is morally wrong, and can be ethically correct.  In legal parlance, for example, a Justifiable Homicide is just a murder that was warranted by circumstances.  Still morally wrong, but ethically and legally acceptable.  Situational Ethics.  A code of conduct that is adjusted by the circumstances of the individual situation.
mwzocd,,hfyb32x,Thanks for teaching us the difference between morality and ethics. So all that fancy word salad bullshit aside, you agree that the situation calls for it.  So why all fire and brimstone over ppl being sympathetic to a homeless hungry girl taking food from boat owners?
mwzocd,,hfyr0ue,You are welcome.  You seemed to need the lesson.  I don't agree that this situation called for it.  The OP clearly admits in the comments that food stamps were available, but the OP made the choice not to accept them.  The OP also did not like the quality of food at their local food bank.  They also refused to use their local soup kitchen.  So this theft of food was not a last choice, it was not a "no other choice".. which might have made it situationally correct.  The OP had alternatives to theft and they made the choice not to use them.  Ethically unacceptable.
mwzocd,,gvmekau,Actually, no. If someone who was really hungry took my peanut butter, or my burger, or my bread, or whatever else, I would not be angry. I currently work a job where I can afford to re buy those things easily. I do think things like murder or assault are immoral -- hurting another person physically can't be justified. But stealing from a very rich person does not hurt them -- and there's a high likelihood that they would have thrown out the food anyway. I am not trying to "justify stealing," I simply do not think morality is black and white.
mwzocd,,gvmhjkw,Your just trying to justify it. You dont know the financial status of the people your stealing from. You dont know if they can afford to replace what your steal. Just because you can handle being stolen from does not mean everyone else on the planet can as well. Your justification requires a lot of assumptions to stay morally grey at best. I dont care if they are on a boat or whatever, you dont know.
mwzocd,,gvmlldb,You probably would hate Wall Street Investors and what they do to the "little guys"
mwzocd,,gvngss1,I hate everyone lol.. I mean except Christopher Walken... He was in country bears
mwzocd,,gvnfdhk,>  I simply do not think morality is black and white.   That's because you don't understand morality.  What you describe, in thinking that morality is not black and white, is actually something called [Situational Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_ethics).  Because I doubt you will click the link, situational ethics are when you judge whether or not a situation is right or wrong based on the context of the specific situation, as opposed to an absolute moral code.  Morals are most definitely an absolute black and white/right and wrong thing.  > I am not trying to "justify stealing,"   Yes, you are.  Every time you bring up someone's financial status in regards to whether or not it is OK to steal from them, you are justifying when it is OK to steal.  If it is NOT alright to steal from a poor person, but it \*IS\* alright to steal from a rich person, you are justifying stealing.  If you insist that it would not bother you if someone stole food from you, you are justifying stealing.  You also keep avoiding the questions that are put to you... using Redirection to keep attempting to control the conversation.  So... I'll repeat a couple for you that you sidestepped.  > Is there something wrong with bragging about stealing, in a post in a homeless sub? Is there something wrong with posting about how one successfully committed crimes, in a homeless sub?   Now... you asked if it was wrong to post frequently in the homeless sub, and your question was answered.  You asked if it was wrong to get donations and your question was answered.  Now, answer mine.  The two above there that I quoted.  Or are you unable to answer mine because you know you are in the wrong?  Oops... there's another question you are likely to attempt to sidestep.
mwzocd,,gvnktpu,Yes, I would agree with the concept of situational ethics, though I have never heard that term before.
mwzocd,,gvnn1ve,War is a good example.  In general, shooting someone is bad.  But if you are in the military, and your superior says "Shoot the enemy"... shooting someone isn't "bad" anymore.  However, there exists a term... Conscientious Objector.   "A conscientious objector is an "individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service" on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion. In some countries, conscientious objectors are assigned to an alternative civilian service as a substitute for conscription or military service."  From Wikipedia.  This would be a person who, regardless of the ethics of the situation, refuses to budge from their moral code.  The Absolute, versus the Flexible.  Personally, in regards to Laws in general, I follow Situational Ethics.  There are laws I disagree with, and there are laws I will break, but there are also laws I most definitely agree with.  Morally, I feel that the CONCEPT of law is absolutely necessary.  I am just fully aware that there are some laws on the books to protect the population, and there are some laws on the books to protect only a small selection of the population... and there are some laws strictly in place to control the population.  Like... how oral sex is illegal in some states in the USA.  Seriously.  Being opposed to THAT law, doesn't mean one is opposed to EVERY law.... and being opposed to that law doesn't mean one now has to oppose every law.  Laws against theft protect everyone... rich and poor.  The execution of that protection might be lopsided, with the rich getting more protection... but that is not the fault of the law.  That is the fault of those sworn to uphold the law.  Failure of our police to protect the poor who have been robbed, is not the fault of the laws against theft.
mwzocd,,gvnfok8,Wow you are really invested in this lmao. This was not even a reply to what you said!
mwzocd,,gvnjdvi,You don't get to decide what comments I reply to.  Kind of narcissistic to think that you can.  Invested?  No less than you.  I'm replying to your comments, after all.  And you STILL can't answer direct questions put to you, even when others answer your questions.  Nothing reasonable about you.
mwzocd,,gvm8b1m,Hypothetical A) Ask for food and ye shall be fed. Hypothetical B) Yes, that is immoral.
mwzocd,,gvmabma,> B) Yes, that is immoral.  You probably want to avoid visiting /r/Trees
mwzocd,,gvm8wfs,In your hypothetical... the fact that she is about to die of starvation doesn't alter the morality of stealing.  However, she was not starving.  And, there are resources available to her that she hasn't exploited, before she turned to stealing.  And... she has said clearly that she didn't steal because she was hungry... she stole because she doesn't want to sign up for EBT, because signing up for EBT means she has to talk to people, and she doesn't want to talk to people.  Except on Reddit, apparently.  And in your second hypothetical... you compare drinking during prohibition to theft.  I guess that means I can propose a similar hypothetical to you where I compare theft with murder.  I mean... that's what we are doing in this second hypothetical, right?  Comparing different "crimes"?  But... to deal with your second hypothetical... it may not be immoral to brag about breaking the law, but it is most certainly unethical.  A law may be wrong... but until it is changed, the law has to be followed.  And this hypothetical proves it out.  It didn't used to be illegal to drink alcohol... and then it was illegal to drink it... and now it isn't illegal anymore.  Laws can and do change.  While something is illegal, it is unethical to brag about doing it.  Now, comparing your hypothetical to the actual... she was indeed bragging, talking about her "score" and how life was smiling on her.  It is unethical for her to brag about committing this crime, because she is taking no actual responsibility for her actions (she admitted the crime anonymously) and her post will encourage a few others to also justify stealing because they think they have a strong need.
mwzocd,,gvmexpe,We can agree to disagree, but I do not think that just because something is law it is automatically "right". There are thousands in prison for possession or smoking of tiny amounts of weed. I do not believe they deserve to be imprisoned. Similarly, is stealing from a rich person who left their food around unethical? I personally do not think so. Maybe you disagree, but it seems strange for the person I was initially responding to to attack the OP for talking about this.
mwzocd,,gvmn2v1,>A law may be wrong... but until it is changed, the law has to be followed.  I did acknowledge that a law can be wrong.  I quoted myself there, just to remind you.  I said nothing at all about any law being automatically right.  That's a straw man argument you are making.  There are indeed thousands of people in prison for marijuana, even still in states where pot has been made legal.  This is the important point you are ignoring.  AT THE TIME these people were arrested, charged, and convicted, they were doing something that THEY KNEW was against the law.  These people KNEW they were doing something that could and likely would result in fines or jail time, but they CHOSE to do it anyway.  They could have been more careful and not have gotten caught (like myself and millions of others have done), and they could now be enjoying legal recreational grass purchased from the store down the road.  However, they made their choices, they got bagged, and they had to pay the price.  And it wasn't like they made their choice to smoke pot and immediately went to jail.  They made their choices to smoke it while driving around, likely over the speed limit, with the radio blaring and their friends living it up in the back seat attracting the attention of local law enforcement.  Or they chose to purchase from a questionable or unknown dealer.  Or they chose to sell it so they could make ends meet.  Or they chose to be a mule and move large quantities from one location to another.  The details make ALL the difference... since we've got magnitudes of people smoking pot that have NEVER had any legal problems whatsoever, as compared to the ones in jail for it.  Did you know that in Connecticut, for all these years, you could pay your tax on the illegal pot you purchased?  You could take that ounce you purchased, go to the local courthouse or assayers office, have it weighed, pay your tax, get a tax stamp for the payment... and then smoke it at your leisure?  Sure, it was still illegal... but if you got caught with it, all of a sudden you only faced a small fine for possession.  The bulk of the charges and fines in Connecticut for having pot, were for evading the taxes on it.  There's been a federal tax stamp for pot since 1938.  Did people take advantage of this, to reduce the trouble they could face?  Nope.  Sure... you can blame the laws... but the truth is, the choices people make are responsible for the actions and consequences they face.  And again... the MILLIONS of pot smokers who never faced any legal consequences prove that it isn't the law to blame.  Stealing from a "rich" person, is just stealing from someone who has more than you do.  Your definition of "rich" is different from my definition.  I guarantee that the OP never checked up on tax records for the people who owned the boat before they went aboard and stole the food.  The OP assumed.  For all we know, the people the OP saw were using a friend's boat... or a relative's boat.  But you and the OP are assuming that these people were "rich" just because they had use of a boat.  Maybe the laptop and the tablet belonged to the people who owned the boat, but not the people who used it.  Assuming the people who left the food were "rich" just because these things were present on the boat when the OP was trespassing on it was wrong.  Stealing from these people was acting on facts not in evidence.  There is ample evidence available that pushing boundaries like these, only leads to pushing those boundaries even further.  The more success involved, the further those boundaries get pushed the next time.  That is how we learn what we can get away with, and what we can't.  The path that the OP is on, in that she enjoyed the results of stealing from that boat (aka she scored, and life smiled on her), is that she is likely to do it again and again... and eventually she won't stop at stealing food.  Or stealing money or a wallet from a "rich" person's car or purse.  Or breaking into a "rich" person's house to steal food... or other things.  Every single justification you make for why stealing from the "rich" is acceptable, is a justification for why stealing from ANYONE you think has more than you do is also acceptable.  You can't just say "Oh, it only applies to the rich."  Define "rich".  And then provide positive proof that the people who left the food behind were "rich".  And as I already pointed out, we have no proof that the people who left the food behind even owned that boat.
mwzocd,,gvndf3a,Truly, OP bankrupted these boat goers by stealing their peanut butter. Truly a tragedy. Prison for her!
mwzocd,,gvngu0w,Ah... Exaggeration.  That's a horrible way to logically and reasonably make your case.  And it fails.
mwzocd,,gvmqmwr,[deleted]
mwzocd,,gvnhqtt,Really?  That's all she took?  Just a jar of peanut butter?  Wow.  That changes everything... because I read her post and she said...  > Got myself a nice jar of chunky peanut butter, life is so much better with peanut butter. A few cans of tuna fish, bottles of water, and they had a shitload of chicken and hamburger, so grabbed me some chicken, Not enuf to be missed, but enough for me to eat, some chips and cheese.   I dunno about you... but that seems like more than just a "can" of peanut butter.  I get it.  You need to reduce what she did, to something as small as possible, so you can present the "It Is No Big Deal" argument.  And I'm sure you will continue to present the "It Is No Big Deal" argument, even after proving you weren't quite up to speed of the details involved in this whole thing... since you didn't really know what she stole.  Our legal system takes into account the value of what is stolen.  In most states, stealing less than $250 worth of something is a misdemeanor and called PETTY THEFT.  In some states, this dollar amount is higher, up to $500.  Anything over that petty theft limit is a felony, and has degrees... as in First Degree Theft, or Second Degree Theft, etc.  And in California, they have something called Felony Petty Theft, which is also referred to as Petty Theft with a Prior.  Which means that if she steals a little food and gets caught a few  times doing that, she can end up being charged with a Felony.  All over a "can" of peanut butter, as you say.  This is the point where you abandon all reason and logic, and jump straight to the insults and derisive remarks.
mwzocd,,gvn8cyw,Where are the others like us?!?!?? ‚ò∫Ô∏è
mwzocd,,gvne0fe,Not in jail for assuming we can be idiots and flaunt our pot habits in front of the cops... and not in jail for assuming we can steal from those who we think are richer than we are.  That's for sure.
mwzocd,,gvrejda,[removed]
mwzocd,,gvm5i1u,You couldn't be more mistaken about Jessie.  You're free to nurse your suspicions in private, but please don't try to shame people for doing exactly what this forum is for: sharing experiences.  -Fuzzy
mwzocd,,gvm7ifr,Many many many people here share their experiences in the way this group was intended. They receive support in the way it was intended.  Then there are people who know how to play the game. Work people. They know what triggers sympathy and hand outs. Back in the day they were called con artists, grifters.  Do you know what CON means in this context?  Confidence. They get people to believe them, feel for them, etc.   They work it. My cousin as a child was a perfect example. She knew how to work people and would often say with a smile ‚Äúworks every time‚Äù.  I know the history with OP. I know her game. I‚Äôm not the only one.
mwzocd,,gvmbs8x,[deleted]
mwzocd,,gvmd85m,Not all women, CON WOMEN. Scammers!!!!
mwzocd,,gvmkq4n,[deleted]
mwzocd,,gwiyuvt,Right? People are freaking out as if she has personally done something horrid to them! Like, it's a story about scoring some peanut butter.   They are acting like it is some fact that she is a con artist when in fact I think it is plain ole misongony. It totally sucks (and even from women- it just becomes internalized misongony, I bet they wouldn't be as angry if a man wrote this story.) It is definitely just a "feeling" they have that shows more about them than about this poster.  It is kinda sad for them to be taking out their anger on this girl. They really seem to need some help with issues and I hope they get it instead of tearing others down.
mwzocd,,gvn53vj,Some people like helping, so if she is trying to gain with her "story" and someone helps and feels good for doing it, is there really harm? I get both sides .
mwzocd,,gwgky8d,Yes, there's harm.  Good hearted folks inclined to help will give that help to scammers, instead of others who really and truly need the assistance.
mwzocd,,gvn7z7l,Yes, there is harm.  People - especially females - and especially females like her - learn how to milk the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù and guess that? It works for them. Like REALLY works!   Guess who nothing usually works for? The men. The shy women. The people who never learned how to ask for help, much less admit they need it. The invisible ones.   It‚Äôs AMAZING when people are kind enough to help members here - I have been the recipient of such generosity, and it can be life changing. Even if it‚Äôs just a stranger reaching out to buy you a pizza. Or offer you their driveway to park in for a few weeks. Or a cash donation.   But there‚Äôs a difference between coming here to share your life, the good and bad, to vent if you need to, etc.... and coming here to ‚Äúwork it‚Äù.   Those who come here to ‚Äúwork it‚Äù disgust me.  Oh, and there is only so much emotional and intellectual energy that I have each day to spare. I‚Äôm not going to jump through hoops to PROVE this or that.   My goal is to help people open their eyes and utilize inductive reasoning. To stop and think twice before giving. I am a sucker. Always have been, always will be. My na√Øvet√© seems to know no limits. My foolish belief that if I am honest with others, they will be honest with me. If they can trust me, that I can trust them. If I wouldn‚Äôt do something awful, that they wouldn‚Äôt either.   But the world just doesn‚Äôt work that way. I have never been able to protect myself from being hurt in a variety of ways. Stupid na√Øve little girl inside. But I can damn well stand up to fight for others, and I damn well do - even if it involves risking my life for someone else.
mwzocd,,gvn9v62,That's tough when you put yourself out there and get hurt, me I have very low expectations of humanity so not much gets me, remember money and possessions are illusions , health and happiness are everything, I hope you have both
mwzocd,,gvnbta2,I don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the problem. I‚Äôm alone in the world besides my dog. I‚Äôm physically handicapped. I‚Äôm mentally and emotionally disabled. I live in my car which don‚Äôt get me wrong i am thankful for. But when you are handicapped and can‚Äôt even have a toilet to use.... and so much of the bare minimums in life are denied .... and everything you try fails. And everyone you trust screws you over OR just wants to screw you because that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre good for.
mwzocd,,gvnd3p2,If you ever need to talk, I m not on Reddit as much as I used to be, but I'm a good listener, my real name is Reed
mwzocd,,gvqit9w,Thank you Reed. I wish I could take you up on your kind offer.
mwzocd,,gvqtmf3,You are very welcome,, I really do hope things pick up for u, what is your dogs name?

mwzocd,,gvni4zl,She isn't being shamed for sharing an experience.  Don't try to downplay this by ignoring the facts she herself posted.  She is being shamed for stealing, and then bragging about it online.  And bragging is the correct word, since she considers what she did to be a "score", and she considers the experience to be Life smiling down on her.  She feels no regret for stealing from people she believes can afford the loss.  And in the comments, she admits that she stole... not because she was hungry, but because she doesn't want to get Food Stamps since that means talking to people, and she feels that she would rather steal than talk to people.  So... cut the whole "It Is No Big Deal" thing.  That argument means nothing.  Deal with the facts.  She is free to share her experiences all she wants.  She just doesn't have the right to glorify or justify stealing from others, just because she is too fucking lazy to go through "proper" channels to get food.
mwzocd,,gvpj9vb,> n't being shamed for sharing an experience. Don't try to downplay this by ignoring the facts she herself posted. >  > She is being sham   You're getting two things confused.  I never said you shouldn't rant about her stealing peanut butter.  That's your call.  I said you shouldn't accuse her of manipulating people into giving her money.  You made that public accusation without evidence.
mwzocd,,gvqpo6o,>but please don't try to shame people for doing exactly what this forum is for: sharing experiences.  THAT is what you said.  Don't attempt to re-write history here.  You didn't say we shouldn't accuse her of manipulating people.  You said we shouldn't shame her for sharing experiences.  And... \*I\* am not the one who said she is manipulating people.  \*I\* am the one who pointed out that she is bragging about stealing from people, and then I pointed out the words and phrases she used that prove she feels no regret and was bragging about her success.  Please get your facts straight.
mwzocd,,gvs7ee7,True, I was responding to 'DollBaby' - her accusation against OP - and you stepped in for her - one of your 20 posts. But that confusion is on ME. My fault. For the record, I see you didn't accuse OP of manipulation.  The peanut butter incident is a litmus test of assholery, and I wouldn't try to stop you from being yourself.
mwzocd,,gvsej39,Well, since you can clearly see in the thread here, while you \*thought\* you were responding to DollBaby, you hit the Reply on my post... because Reddit sent the notification to me that you were responding to my post.  I didn't "Step In".  I responded to a reply to one of my posts.  20 posts, 40 posts... 100 posts... it doesn't matter.  Having ethics and standing up for what one believes in shouldn't have a limit on the number of posts.  Sticking to the facts at hand, rather than allow for a conversation to be redirected away from the topic takes a few posts.  Especially with the people who want to turn this into ANYTHING that isn't actually what it is... which is about a girl who chose to steal and brag about it instead of filling out the paperwork to get EBT.  So, I'm not an asshole for sticking to the facts at hand and the topic of the conversation.  I'm not an asshole for steering the ship back on course.  But yes... when someone steals peanut butter and a bunch of other foods from someone they THINK is rich just because they look rich because they used a boat... and then the brag about it online like they did something good and praiseworthy... and it is all because they don't want to be bothered with the paperwork for signing up for EBT... it is indeed a litmus test.  When people defend ... what was it you said... assholery like that... when people defend others stealing just because they don't want to do a little paperwork to get food stamps, that does tell you something about society.
mwzocd,gvrap1v,,I stole things when I was homeless.  I didn't feel particularly bad about it then.   I would make different choices today, but my life looks a lot different today than it did then.  I don't look back on the choices I made then with any particular shame or remorse.    There are degrees to all this I think.  A person sleeping in a car every night is arguably better off than a person sleeping in a tent every night.  The guy in the tent is arguably better off than someone sleeping on a rooftop every night.  That guy who's been sleeping on a rooftop every night for the last couple of weeks is arguably better off, just by reason of experience, than the poor man who's sitting on a park bench this afternoon wondering where he's going to spend his first night outdoors.  Everybody is trying to make it with the resources they have available to them.  Everybody's 'edge' is different.  That thing that brings me to the edge of giving up and losing hope might be really different from the thing that does it for you.  If a jar of peanut butter is the thing that gives a person the will and the determination (not to mention the nourishment) to keep going for another day, then so be it.  I'm not in a place to sit here and judge that action.  I will say that I don't think OPs actions are sustainable.  She seems to feel relatively invisible right now, but someone has likely noticed.  If she continues to steal from the area close to her campsite she'll probably end up in jail or rousted out of the spot that she calls home for now.  I would suggest an abundance of caution.
mwzocd,gvmcxt2,,I like how you mentioned you left the iPad so when you talked about stealing food people wouldn't perceive you as a thief. You still stole food from a family. What if the kids had caught you? They would of been traumatized. I hope your life gets better, stop stealing peoples shit.
mwzocd,gvl6vdd,,You never know but you might be able to score more when you actually ask someone for assistance. I guess it depends on the person you're talking to. I'm glad you didn't steal their valuables! If they find out that somebody needs food they're probably going to be willing to give it. I guess it just depends on the person. Don't you have food stamps?
mwzocd,,gvlj8p8,no and the animals here dont take them
mwzocd,,gvlkp69,and that would mean I hVE TO TALK to people.  I don't want to talk to people.
mwzocd,,gvm1zlj,Sure sounds like it, coming here to tell all these random strangers anonymously that youre a thief, really shows how much you dont want to talk to people. Let me guess, youre not like other girls?
mwzocd,,gvn1d5m,Lol damn. Someone get some ice!
mwzocd,,gvlx9ic,Then starve. Talk to people if you are hungry, or starve.   Don‚Äôt be a thief.
mwzocd,gvofztv,,So steal food from other people so they can't eat and brag about it. Shitty attitude.
mwzocd,,gvoqxog,Exactly. People are missing the point here. 'She' is bragging these people were sloppy. Reminds me of ppl casing homes. Asking can I use your phone while scope place. It's a tactic among burglars. 'She' went into a private place just to take food and gloats about it.   Look, I don't give a fuck about big chain stores, but enter in people's boats, homes, or tents then there IS a problem. ' She' seems to be playing 'poor me I'm hungry.' Manipulation tactic.  And to add: How many thristy dudes helped 'her.' It's pretty obvious this person is a scammer if you read post history.  No way that is 'her' and with feet pic  come the fuck on ppl. I bet this is a disgusting dude with severe porn addiction.   No woman would brag about being gang banged like your post history shows you sick man Cool if you dudes did. I'm telling ya, this is a man!  No woman would brag as this op.getting gang banged. This is a nasty perv.  Bringing I'm a 10 yr old sis also sounds like a chmo. Chmo u bring a child up m. I know you're an old guy. Ok, your gross.  It's like a playbook for chmoa and rapists. You are a MAN! Go away freak. Karma is a bitch.  I know you a hard core ponr  She and her little sister and all the bullshit. Scam and I bet it's a dude. Without a doubt.  I've been homeless for yrs as a woman, raped as a kid, this person is playing y'all  and I've seen it. No drugs, just depressed. I've seen plenty of nasty predators, got helped, blah, blah, seen all kinds of shit, and no I never robbed ppl, but I have seen low life's who played ppl. It's disgusting!
mwzocd,,gvw8cwe,I agree she's a scammer it's crazy how many ppl fell for it
mwzocd,,gw8o1ev,'She most is.'  If you look at post history, no way it's a woman. Maybe 1 out of 1000. Gaslighting, mainpuu tactics. Scammer. Whatever, ppl use common sense. For Christ sake, she has feet pic as pic Straight up dude!
mwzocd,,gwivc8o,Do you know how many women have feet pics on their profiles? Especially since she was a sex worker? They sell just like nudes do. So she puts a pic on there and that way if some dude wants to pay her a bit for some private feet pics it is easy money.    So just keep weird and thinking you know all.   If I came back to my boat and some food was stolen I would be straight up glad. Most of the food on the boats we've had has always gone to waste. And I know that if someone is stealing food from my boat then they prolly were pretty desperate and I would be glad they were fed for awhile.    Not everyone is gonna feel like me of course but not everyone is as shitty as you either.
mwzocd,,gx02ckq,Right cause it's cool to steal until u have a gun on ya You sound shitty with no morals.  Go to a food bank lazy . You.just swipe ppl food, lol  Lazy bum. Try breaking in my place, your shot  Oh wait, it's cool to hit up food on private property  You sound like an entitled bum
mwzocd,,gx03dcw,Yes that is exactly what I wrote. You quoted me exactly there.   Does anyone else smell straw in here?   And what does that have to do with her being a scammer anyway? Or that a lot of girls will put feet pics up since it is a way to get money out of thirsty men without the sex work?
mwzocd,,gx03r3q,It's a man!! Whatever  I'm done
mwzocd,,gx0449j,"ITS A MAN BABY" -Austin Powers.
mwzocd,,gx04ju5,Its a fake man. But bye into it. I know.
mwzocd,,gx04r40,Um last I checked, men are into feet, not women  Feet r nasty. Definitely a man! I was on Streets I saw all kinds of shit, esp guys with feet fetish. Whatever. I'm calling this bitch out.  Use to sell myself This is a dude. Lmao  Fall for it  Just warning others ü§£
mwzocd,,gx04z81,Yes. That is why a girl will have a picture. So that she can sell feet pics to crusty foot fetish guys. See? You are making my argument for me.   I know I'm not giving you a lot of credit but I did think you could read. I said that she had them so that guys would pay her for more feet pics. So yeah, I obviously get that guys are the ones with the fetish. How many times do I have to tell you that?
mwzocd,,gx05aiu,This bitch has different pics. Are you that naive? üòÜ
mwzocd,,gx05vnq,Lovely language you use to speak about women. That tells me all I need to know.
mwzocd,,gx8no2s,K. your right about my language  My bad being on Streets. Semantics. None the less, I saying this woman is a dude, sigh.
mwzocd,,gw935ey,Yeah, i just checked it and it does look like it. Wouldn't be the first time guy was posing as a woman on here either.
mwzocd,,gw93ywh,Lol, I guess laugh, but sadly I don't want ppl taken advantage. So I put it out
mwzocd,gvncx47,,Dogs are the best,I'm working on being in a stable living/ life situation so I can have 1
mwzocd,,gvngvvv,awesome, hope it happens soon for you.
mwzocd,,gvnhsaf,I hope everything works out good for you and I know you would share 1 of the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with any one of us ;)
mwzocd,,gvnhlcd,Me to,I have a day dream where a dog finds me,it happened once with kittens,I followed a tiny noise and found 2 adorable kittens I was living in a motel and couldn't keep them but a guy working there did.
mwzocd,,gvnj7pm,thats great...animals are the best
mwzocd,gvlyi9o,,makes me laugh all these holier than thou homeless people that would go hungry rather than "liberate" a jar of peanut butter and a few other bits off food of some boat  (edit -changed of to off didnt want the suede denim grammar police on my back ,we already got the peanut butter crime squad watching this thread with interest thanks to jessies hunger fuelled antics)  edit damm i still got of and off the wrong way round
mwzocd,,gvm0d6p,lol...yeah...the ones passing judgment have only been homeless when they are traveling and forced to stay in a 5 star hotel.
mwzocd,,gvm4owy,[deleted]
mwzocd,,gvmf3t3,and I didnt mean to either...just giving an update since I've been working on my spot and not near any wifi. It is funny how people make all sorts of assumptions and jump to conclusions about things.
mwzocd,,gvm7gtg,It is fascinating how you can compartmentalize and justify all of this, just by ignoring lots of details.  Theft is wrong, regardless of how hungry you are.  I guarantee there are resources available to the OP if she only took advantage of them, and she wouldn't have to steal to eat.  There's EBT.  There's dumpster diving.  There are food banks.  There are soup kitchens.  There are fast food restaurants that throw away food at the end of the night.  And if she is in a place where there are docks of cabin cruisers she can steal from, I guarantee that there are social services she can get EBT from, and there are supermarkets with dumpsters, and there are food banks and soup kitchens and fast food restaurants.  So these people wouldn't rather go hungry than steal a measly jar of peanut butter.  These people would rather make use of all the available resources before resorting to theft.
mwzocd,gvmi8b5,,Stealing is bad... Tell that to corrupt politicians
mwzocd,gvn3ynm,,A lot of the homeless people I  know aren't as politically correct as some people on this sub , rules are different when surviving day to day with all most no income no home to hunker down in . If all she took is food good 4 her. Hate be like this but I don't believe half the shit anyway.
mwzocd,gvnpwys,,Creepy watching people leave their boat. Sounds like a predator. If someone was on that boat, you could have been shot because your 'hungry.' No one knows your intent trespassing on someone's property.  Sounds like instant gratification, impulse disorder. You couldn't fly a sign. Lmao.  Esp since your a 'woman' you would've have food easily. But, who knows who you are judging by your post history.  2nd, I've been burned in the past so it's easier for me to spot low lifes with no integrity.   Food is abdundant in this Country, hence plenty of obese ppl. Cool you didn't steal the electronics to feed your meth habit. Wow.
mwzocd,,gvr9u5e,sounds like you watch way too much tv
mwzocd,,gw8qz5n,Sounds like your a predator, thief old dude. How's your 10 your sis you protect creep. I know your a man. So fuck off. Did you scope more boats weirdo? How's your sis creep. You wrote you took care of sis . Man , I know your an old, creepy dude. I've been a woman on Streets, you fucks need to die
mwzocd,,gwivhcd,Omg that person is fucking insane. I've seen so many pics of feet on girls profiles. Seems kinda unhinged to me. Don't let the incels get ya down.
mwzocd,,gwjuzgo,lol, omg incel...I was thinking that when I saw another post by one of those idiots,  The only hunger he has known is when the guy in front of him in the drive through is moving too slow.
mwzocd,,gwk48gg,Yeah- it's getting easier and easier to smell incels in the room. They gotta get off the internet and talk to a real live girl!
mwzocd,gvmzm3m,,Since it's no big deal you robbed these people can you stop whining about how all your John's skeet in you and toss you to the curb. After all it's no big deal. You were probably "sloppy" that day. I am seriously hoping your "stories" are figments of your drug high because you carry yourself like an EMBARRASSEMENT to the homeless community. You TRESSPASSED AND BURGULARIZED! You are typical junkie garbage that somehow think you are different. Don't think that you are being sly. Someone is watching you and you will be jailed soon. I hear that's a great place for weirdos like you that don't want to be around people. (The thought of a homeless junkie hooker thinking she is BETTER than other is a gas lol) I quadruple dog dare you to pull that stunt in county jail since it's no big deal.
mwzocd,,gvnh20x,thank you for your well thought out opinion, I will value it always.
mwzocd,,gvnjvja,That person sounds unhinged.
mwzocd,,gwiw1j4,Omg, yet another unhinged lunatic. What is it about this post bringing them all out? Wtf?
mwzocd,,gwjun2p,Lot's of them out there. Kinda shows you how their life is going, what they hold on to.  Imagine being their kid, then again, he is prolly an incel.
mwzocd,,gwk3ydt,Yeah certainly seems to hate women that is for sure. Probably unironically watches that red-pilled shit. Anyway, I hope you don't let any of these fuckwads get you down. Just think of how internally miserable you have to be to spread hate against people on the internet that have never even done anything to them.    It also seems to me that they are actually pretty jealous of you for some reason. Like, bruh, don't be angry that someone got resources that you need. Be angry at a system that creates false scarcity when there is enough food to feed every single person on the planet right now. Yet thousands and thousands of poeple starve to death every single day. It is crazy.  I not only feel for any kids- I even feel for the parents! (Unless they were the ones that caused the hate.)    Anyway sorry for the rant! I just can't stand all these judgemental asshats. I gotta make sure they don't get to ME better, lol!
mwzocd,,gwnuwar,nah, it's ok...nice to see other people think like I do.
mwzocd,,gwo1mhf,I got into a discussion with someone in here and they said stealing is ALWAYS wrong (which to me is ridiculous) so I gave a hypothetical of one if the jews in a concentration camp starving and serving lots of food to a high up nazi, would it be stealing to take a piece of bread- and he said that although justified, it was still wrong!!! That to me is crazy. Like.. bruh?   I mean, of course it is not nearly as severe but in capitalism it is still oppressor/oppressed, y'know? Anyway, I hope things start to get a bit better! And I hope now that things get a bit warmer you will be more comfortable out there. I had 1 friend that was homeless once and the thing that seemed to stick with him was just how cold it always was!   I think your writing style is quite engaging and I hope to read some more. Hope you have a good sunday! üñ§
mwzocd,,gwoif1e,Yeah, that type of person is just black / white, this or that and their minds are set in stone.  I had a talk with one of those born again types and I asked if suicide is always wrong? omg he went off, yes, it is an unforgivable sin, blah blah blah.  I said then why is it encouraged and awarded in this country. Of course, he had this totally confused look.  I said in war, when a soldier jumps on a grenade, he knows he is killing himself to save his other army guys.  The excuse Mr. born again gave me, oh, well that is different, it's what is in your heart.  So like no matter what you bring up, they find a way to twist it to support their way of thinking.
mwzocd,gvm0oae,,Good for you! The debates here are kind of annoying. If they own a boat then a jar of peanut butter is a tiny drop in the bucket for them, they can buy another one without feeling any hardship. "Stealing is bad!!" -- clearly you've never been hungry, like REALLY hungry.
mwzocd,gvnfhef,,I'd steal food if I was hungry too. People want to ignore me, then ignore what I do too.
mwzocd,,gvngsn9,I know.  I have to laff at the people who say oh, I would never do this or I would never do that.  Everyone with any common sense calls bullshit on that. One guy said, I went 2 days without eating and I never stole.  Great for him, try a week then get back to me. Watch your little sister go hungry and tell me you would never.  So many self righteous people out there.
mwzocd,gvnkcc3,,Look, I don't endorse stealing. But all of us, we have to do what we have to do to survive, and I don't judge that. No one is looking out for us, for the most part. And I would understand thats Jessi's case as well. Everyone on this sub, I would assume, has "broken the law" in their survival somehow. It would be "wronger", if she had stolen or taken the computers or if someone was ripping off someone else who was homeless. But this life, its like guerilla warfare. Sometimes you do what you have to do in order to acquire the resources you need.
mwzocd,,gvue0kk,and it's usually right and even lawfully right when you find a way to get away with it... for example if Jessie had stolen the computers and be able to prove before law that she didn't... then it becomes right in the eye's of the law... There are a lot of "white collar thieves" that get away with theft everyday, and nobody throws bullshit at them because nobody is able to prove shit or even know about it... Jessie is more morally innocent than those guys, by admitting her crime in a public forum, it requires an immoral attitude to commit a crime and the stay silent about it and pretend it didn't happened... That shows that you know what you did was wrong and you are guilty ... In Jessie's case her post shows her innocence of the whole subject matter
mwzocd,gvm4fur,,The funniest part of this "story" is that a homeless drug addict hooker that fears her own shadow has the gall to judge others. 2021 folks!
mwzocd,,gvmob9j,Look at this naked cruelty.  This poster 'obective-row' uses throwaway reddit accounts to abuse others and changes his/her ID every few days to clear the toxic history.  Why are you on this sub?
mwzocd,gvm6jo9,,Great update, and don't change your posts one bit.  Haters gonna hate..
mwzocd,,gvmemkb,lol, oh yeah, lots of life is great people out there...love to pass judgment and talk about how they turned their life around.  They do give me a laugh.
mwzocd,,gvmly9l,You are doing the right thing by avoiding people, people are asses
mwzocd,,gvnh4jo,ikr, and seems like a lot of them have found this group to spread their poison and hate.
mwzocd,gvnk9r1,,I don't post regularly but I'm starving tonight. I guess I'm looking for sympathy too right? None of you would actually feed us or my DMs would be flooded with handouts.   Stealing seems the way to go if no one's going to help.
mwzocd,,gvug2zm,You were starving last night.  So.  I have to ask... knowing you aren't going to answer... if you are in the USA, why aren't you on EBT/SNAP?  Why don't you dumpster dive behind supermarkets and convienence stores?  Why don't you visit food banks?  Why don't you eat at soup kitchens?  Why don't you ask for food at closing time at Fast Food restaurants (the stuff they have to throw away at closing)?  Why don't you visit the back doors of sit-down restaurants, with your hat in hand, to ask them for a plate of whatever they can spare?  I don't have to do those things much these days... I get my EBT.  And it is more than enough to feed me for the month, to the point where I can make meals for other people around me.  I do still go on dumpster diving runs.  The AM/PM stores around here toss out big bags of the food they heat up during their shifts, that they have to throw away after a certain number of hours.  Those dumpster runs are usually so I can drop those bags of food off at someone's camp, who will see a lot of foot traffic so lots of people will eat it.  We even have events here twice a month, where boxes of food are given out.  I generally don't attend them because I can support myself with EBT, and I don't want to take food out of the mouths of those who really need it.  Give a man a fish, he eats for a day.  TEACH A MAN TO DUMPSTER DIVE OR SIGN UP FOR EBT... and he eats for a lifetime.
mwzocd,,gvnmqd7,As I was about to point out... there were times I asked for help back then. Mostly I was ignored. Oddly, the only times I wasn't ignored, was when some creepy dude would try and proposition me, in exchange for something to eat. I'm a guy, and I've dealt with that. Its even worse for females. Either way, asking for help is by no means a guarantee you'll get it.   The reality is that humans only care about themselves and their little worlds. We only care when its convienent to do so. The Mother Teresa's of the world are only around 1 in a billion.
mwzocd,,gvnr6ha,I totally feel that. Some people get all the help in the world while others get shafted. I feel like I want to help people one day when I get in position too.
mwzocd,gvma2fk,,Based.  >Bwaaaaaaaaaaah stealing is wrong  nice spooks nerd
mwzocd,gvlk5nn,,I never realized the judgments from some people.  They are the same type, yeah officer, I left my keys in the car, I mean, it's my car, no one had the right to take it...it's not my fault.  world is full of whiny bitches.
mwzocd,gvrfu09,,gotta steal to eat gotta eat to live otherwise we would all get along nobody had a problem when  Aladdin did it fuck all the haters jess  Survive
mwzocd,gwpb0r8,,Try and steal from me, I fucking dare you. You will get shot, attacked by my pitbull or if your lucky just go to jail.
mwzocd,gvli870,,i would have took the ipad and the laptop no doubt ,fuck them you snooze you lose  downvote me all you want its the truth what can i say ,im a criminal
mwzocd,,gvnj8nc,Ahh yes. Who cares, you got yours. Typical predator. That's as bad as Rich stealing from the poor. Sucks when you come across the wrong person and you get shot because your a thief cuz your mentality is instant gratification.
mwzocd,,gvliqg5,lol, nah, I get you.  I just prefer to be invisible and leave no trace I was ever there.  I also think set up, things like that...so if I'm just taking food, people wont get too upset..plus, trying to get away from bad karma..
mwzocd,,gvljso4,yeah fair enough ,different courses for different horses ..good find with the food tho :)
mwzocd,,gvll14e,thanks.  might even try my ghetto nachos again..lol
mwzocd,,gvlp7v4,To be fair, you probably needed that ipad and laptop more than they do ... and they probably would have bought new ones in a day
mwzocd,,gw8ulnf,Meth is a hella drug
mwzocd,,gw8wghy,Of course . Meth tweakers need electronics more than non druggies.
mwzocd,,gvljtxu,Cant imagine people whove got a boat would miss a couple of electronics.. OP did the right thing, cant say I would have myself
mwzocd,,gw8uihh,No morals
mwzocd,,gvnjniy,You are correct, finders keepers losers weepers, will you be using the ipad-laptop or shall we convert that to dope? Either way enjoy
mwzocd,gvl5eh2,,No judgement, but why didn‚Äôt you pawn the iPad or laptop?
mwzocd,,gvl6mrr,Homeless or not, morals live on.
mwzocd,,gvl7dcx,I definitely hear you lol. Old me would‚Äôve did just that. Now I‚Äôd think twice bc I‚Äôve had stuff stolen and shit don‚Äôt feel good. Karma is also a bitch. Like superstitious or not, karma will frfr bend u over and raw dog ur asshole. Dude is genuinely a good person, a good guy that likes peanut butter :))
mwzocd,,gvlly3g,dude looks like a lady
mwzocd,,gvlkxl2,im sorta in the middle of nowhere, and to do that, I would have to walk into town and have to talk to people, I'm taking a break from humans for awhile.

mwzocd,gwackks,,I basically emptied a 7-Eleven grill when the cashier was in the bathroom yesterday. Felt good to fill up.
mwn7m2,gvj91ap,,Kia Souls are awesome man.  You have a great set up
mwn7m2,,gwv1x5k,I looooove mine. As much as I can love a car. My Scion was a castle, though. Guess you can guess what my type of car is.
mwn7m2,gvjswe9,,Dude, I been living in the back of a Jeep Grand Cherokee for 3 years. I run a small roadside assistance company out of the back of it now, hence the mess but here's day one versus day 900 or so http://imgur.com/a/TyCKsbm
mwn7m2,,gvkv4jc,Roadside assistance company. That's awesome. Do you mind if I ask some questions? I understand if you might not want to share.  How did you come about that idea? How do you compete with things like Triple A and tow companies or does Triple A contract with you?  I assume your in or around a busy city or highway? How do you do your advertising?  Is it mostly dead batteries and flats?  Did you ever consider expanding your business, maybe with other homeless like yourself, i.e. car livers?                I am saving up money to buy a van with the goal of living and hopefully figuring out making a living out of it.  I used to be a handyman and was considering that again.
mwn7m2,,gvl8trt,TBH I'm struggling. I started this company in January and I'm a little financially strapped because lockdown happened shortly thereafter and I haven't fully recovered from that because I've never gotten stimulus either nor PPP, which I'm trying to do now. I can answer your questions but I was going to take time I don't have right now to do so I'll respond later
mwn7m2,,gvo76qg,Ok, so the company is mainly app based, hence the financial issues. The  major app based motorclubs now operate like Uber, the pay absolute shit rates because somebody will take it, the only decent money now is in towing, but I don't tow. I'm struggling because I have no local agreements. I'm hesitant to try to get any bc I have no logos. Sine lockdown took 98% of my business this lifestyle was real handy but I haven't taken a few steps other businesses would have. with no stimulus or PPP I've barely made it. I'm hoping to qualify for ppp so I can pay myself and avoid folding. This past year I have probably only paid myself a couple thousand, everything goes into the business to cover costs. I do want to bring on more people but only if I can pay them fairly and right now, there is no way. I need local contracts as the motorclubs keep 75% or the payment, yet I have to carry million dollar business insurance just like a tow operator.   However, the work isn't particularly hard and I get paid to help people. It's awesome. I am 100% independent, That is the greatest part. I can at least support myself and answer to nobody. I can't really make excuses because I'm the only one involved.   I don't want to tow as it will fundamentaly change what I do. It's is my job to get you on your way under your own power. A tow operator just wants to tow you somewhere. I fix problems, a tow operator may be there to impound your car.... I don't know if I would want to continue doing this if I had to tow. I wouldn't always be the Knight in shining armor, I might have to ruin your day. Towing is predatory and expensive, but it does pay much much better. I am forced with having to carve out a niche in a pretty established business, but since I started when and how I did, I can provide more personalized service at 1/2 the cost, I just gotta get rid of the motorclubs bc they know that and keep my cost savings for.themselves . Anyhow, it's a mixed bag, man. I have a real love/hate relationship with what I do. This job would be great if it weren't for the fucking customers. (Motorclubs)
mwn7m2,gvjcd2v,,You may want to cover up your license plate friend
mwn7m2,,gvjr2x6,because someone might come to their house?
mwn7m2,,gvkv95b,I don't think anyone can identify them with that.
mwn7m2,,gvlo4ay,I think this depends on the state. Where I am, it's possible to find out someones name/DMV info. Why take the risk?
mwn7m2,gvjds3t,,Nice.
mwn7m2,gvjtyw0,,Stay safe. Stay warm.
mwn7m2,gvkg8ue,,Now that's life's lemonade, right there.
mwn7m2,gvklx8b,,I can never unsee the commercial with the hamsters.
mwn7m2,gvktpla,,Blur your license plate!!
mwn7m2,,gvkvrwu,Third person. So Ill ask you as Im genuinely not sure, why does it matter? Know one can identify you from a plate, there is no public list or anything.  At most the people on this sub know what state the car was registered in. That doesn't even mean the person is in that state either.
mwn7m2,,gvkw0xc,Their most likely illegally camping out there LE could take this picture and use it as damning evidence.  Not very likely but still possible. Especially when all you have to do is scribble over the license plate
mwn7m2,gvk2ohu,,Might want to obscure the plate.
mwn7m2,,gvkve7z,Your the 2nd person to say that and Im really curious as to why it matters? You cant identify people with a plate.
mwn7m2,,gvlcr1c,Really?  Try asking at r/rbi or r/rbi2 if people can find you.....you'd be surprised.  My thinking is that someone can make a false claim that a car with the license plate \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ hit their vehicle or property.  if they also know the colour and the basic car (two door or four door) along with the plate number they can make your life difficult by putting enough details in a false police or insurance report that it would be difficult for you to straighten the mess out.  Would it happen?  Who knows.  But it could.  I think this is why you never see license plates in reality tv shows like Pawn Stars - it's always blurred out.
mwn7m2,,gvloh6u,Many people are saying this for a reason. Where I am, it's possible to find out someones name/DMV info from their license plate. Why take the risk?
mwn7m2,gvkrzvv,,That looks so amazing comfy.  :)
mwn7m2,gyj2tsc,,Replace that kia with a petrol only sienna. It should last you alot longer and keep you away from break downs.
mwf2tl,gvi5h05,,Alot of homeless people hangout/live near shelters...but do not/never check-in.
mwf2tl,gvj9mjz,,Yes they have curfews unless you have some sort of special permit because of your job. That's because they aren't going to hold a bed open all night for you in case you don't show up.
mwf2tl,gvhxbwe,,Why do you assume these people are shady?
mwf2tl,,gvhyk3s,Cuzz they do drugs and are drunk most of the time
mwf2tl,,gvhz2io,How do you know?
mwf2tl,,gvhzidh,Cuzz when i was walking my dog a guy wanted to pet him and he was holding a beer while his buddy was rolling a joint
mwf2tl,,gvi3sra,I don't see your problem.   A lot of assumptions. Hopefully your personal situation offers security and comfort indefinitely. Should you endure one of life's little pitfalls, I hope your family and friends will be there with a safety net. If the unthinkable happens, and you end up outside with no one and nothing, promise we won't assume much or pass judgement. Besides, a joint and a few beers is hardly enough to qualify for addiction. I am pretty sure someone will share and show you the ropes. * shrugs * Whatever...
mwf2tl,,gvi2zzv,I've talked to houseless individuals shooting up, rolling blunts, drinking, smoking meth etc. It doesn't mean they are going to attack you. Just because the guy was drinking and his friend was rolling a joint doesn't mean they are bad people. If he literally asked to pet your dog how do you automatically assume they are a terrible person waiting to attack you? You'd probably drink to if you lived outside you know.  But yea most shelters have a time. Don't be so NIMBY but just call and ask when their doors shut
mwf2tl,,gvi4jon,"smoking meth" and "shooting up"  Doing hard drugs is 100% "shady" regardless of where or how they live (so that is a horrible example). Probably shouldnt be hanging out with strangers that do them either. Unless you are trying to help get them sober, better to just keep your distance and let them be them, and you be you...
mwf2tl,,gvi6r2t,I feel that. I meant to add meth use is really the only one that scares me. But I was kickin it in Los Angeles so I mean thats just what was around. I was just implying that simply being a user doesn't automatically mean you are a bad person you know. Definitely shady territory tho
mwf2tl,,gvi34pe,You know that "they do drugs and are drunk most of the time" based on a singular experience of a man wanting to pet your dog?
mwf2tl,,gvi419j,No ive seen multiple people from the shelter that drink and do drugs in the park some even pass out
mwf2tl,,gvko3mr,Look i dont think its wrong that i dont want to see the place i grew up be transformerd to a place where homeless junkies do drugs and pass out
mwf2tl,,gvlpw77,What do you believe would happen if the shelter closed or even just became more restrictive? Do you think the "homeless junkies" would just leave and go elsewhere? Because that would not happen. There would just be *more* "homeless junkies" indulging in their apparent debauchery clogging up your park and hometown 24 hours a day because then they'd have nowhere else to go.   Also, if beer and weed make someone a junkie, then nearly everyone I know and have ever known is a junkie, including some very wealthy people who are not only housed, but own multiple houses. I'm guessing you yourself do not drink any alcohol or partake in any mind altering substances like marijuana, nicotine, or caffeine, and you do not associate with people who do. Anything otherwise would be hypocritical, unless you're admitting that the real problem is you having to see poor people.   Look, being homeless is incredibly hard and soul crushing. Shelters are not really places to get a good nights sleep since you're in close quarters with dozens of other people talking, snoring, coughing, and getting up and down all night, and many shelters kick people out for the day before 7 am. I have absolutely fallen asleep on the bus and in a park before while totally sober because I was so damn tired.   If someone has a beer or a joint to make things feel less bad for awhile, so what? Even if they're shooting heroin, so what? They'll just sleep for awhile. People doing meth are really the only ones to be sure you avoid. Tweakers are unpredictable and can be volatile, but this is true whether they are housed or not.   If you don't want to see homeless people in your town, do something about it besides complain that you can see them. Advocate for programs that assist in getting homeless people housed, low income housing, transitional housing, more shelters. Get involved in local politics and get programs that are simple and easy to get into for mental health and substance abuse issues that are free for people who need them. If you already have them, start more. There are never enough. Start a day refuge for homeless people to hang out at with food, showers, comfortable seating, climate control, real bathrooms, outlets to charge devices, and clothing and laundry if the shelter is closed during the day. Start a clean needle program. Volunteer to do park and street litter removal. Talk to these people, and yes they are people, learn names, find out what kinds of things and services they need that are lacking. *If you don't want to see homeless people where you live, do something to actually help them and actively improve the situation.*  Wishing away things and people you find unpleasant solves nothing at all.
mwf2tl,,gw886y6,Couldn't have said it better.
mwf2tl,gvi2tb5,,I am in Northern California. Curfews at the various shelters is the biggest reason (of many) few seek refuge at them. The rules are more like punishment, the crime? Being homeless. I did not fall from grace, I was pushed. I have been punished enough just for being human. Perhaps somewhere curfew is not an issue...
mwf2tl,gvijh0m,,Yes, every shelter has a curfew.  The times and rules for such are wildly inconsistent, even across various shelters within an agency, and every agency here has different rules.  Some have specific times that you must be present with zero flexibility. Some allow a few late check ins or unexcused nights out within a specified period of time. Some barely keep track of who's coming and going.   I'm an outreach dude, with years in the system here in the NW.  Doing what I do I see every kind of homeless people, spectrums of spectrums. The aggressive solo hermit who keeps a clean camp, to super receptive and friendly drug camps, and everything in between.  The hater comments come from hateful people. Assumptions are useless.
mvtbun,gve4w94,, No I‚Äôve been out of it for a few years and I still get it too.  The trauma of going through homelessness will never leave me unfortunately. I worry it‚Äôs going to happen again inevitably. I have a great job. I‚Äôm spoiled now wirh a great income. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Something is going to happen. I think it all time. But when it does I remind myself that I have been telling myself this everyday for 3 years and it hasn‚Äôt happened yet.   So lately I‚Äôve been saving up and lightly planning to buy a van to try and live in. I know all the homeless tricks but what if I had a real job and work remotely?  It would be awesome.  Or maybe you‚Äôre interested in homesteading and living off the land somewhere. You may be able to satisfy yourself and live in a healthy way vs the danger of homelessness.
mvtbun,,gveb65v,This is my ginormous hug for you...ready? Here it comes (((((Wet-Socks))))). That was a hug. Srsly. I'm just inside now, this week, after being outside for awhile. I'm tripping on all the stuff that's coming up, that I have to unlearn. I honestly hope you're doing well. Hi from the southwest desert.
mvtbun,,gvfy4kp,Thank you! That made my day and I hope you‚Äôre doing well too!
mvtbun,gve4ys5,,Been housed for a few years and I absolutely still  take a mental note of a good spot.
mvtbun,,gvegup8,Same. I suspect the OP is right and that the instinct will stay with us forever.  At least we can try to use it to do some good. Try to point folks to the available and good spots we find. And of course help folks who are struggling anyway we can.
mvtbun,,gveqv2a,>And of course help folks who are struggling anyway we can.  Yeah? Honestly, how do you keep yourself safe while extending yourself? Are you a man? That actually makes it safer to walk alone in the world, and be helpful without being hurt. But I'm listening! How do you do it? What do you look for in a person you want to share good fortune with? What do you watch out for? I've tried to listen to my instincts, and my instincts are honed enough to be able to see the fundamental good in each and every human I meet. Which doesn't help when it's overlayed by predatory or sociopathic tendencies. Tell me more?
mvtbun,,gvetd61,I am generally Male presenting so that does definitely help. No arguments from me there.  As far as what I actually do, I try when able to give folks some money if they ask. I have been super poor pretty much my entire life, so I don't usually have much to spare, but if I can spare any money I do. I also regularly give away a few cigarettes even if I don't have money because I remember how much it sucked not having smokes. And then there is just talking to people, which I know doesn't materially help their situation, but it's nice to have someone treat you like a normal human being. I probably have those sorts of conversations with a dozen or so homeless folks a month. There are some regulars that I have gotten to know over time, like the guy who panhandles near where I buy cigarettes.  Community wise I work with some other local folks to so food and clothing drives sometimes. I try to call in the local government meetings to voice my concerns about anti-homeless legislation. And eventually I'd like to be able to get some tents distributed to folks in tent city.  You definitely have to stay safe, but most folks I have met over the years have been pretty reasonable.  Idk I hope this was at least a little helpful. I guess I just wish more people would remember that homeless people are just people, usually incredibly down on their luck, and it's almost always not their fault that they are in the position they are in.  Edit: It occurs to me that I didn't really answer your question about safety. I look for people who don't look like they are super fucked up on something (a little high or drunk is fine), who don't look dangerous, who are actively seeking money (i.e. panhandling), and who don't give off bad vibes (I'll admit this one is a bit vague). I don't really care how people are dressed. I tend not to carry large amounts of cash (don't have it to carry). I am firm about boundaries (no means no).  I try to be polite and gentle. I try to be understanding and lend an ear, and generally just set the other person at ease. I have a bit of background in mental health, having dealt with my own problems over the years, and also having spent a lot of time volunteering and being a part of a local wellness and recovery center. So I suspect that helps, just knowing what things like schizophrenia looks like, and how to handle it, for example.
mvtbun,,gveur28,That was a sincere response. Thanks for taking the time.   I had a license in psychiatric nursing, it honestly didn't help me discern danger from innocuousness, I think it mage me more compassionate, if anything. Shrug. I'm trying to learn how to find the line where boundaries and helpfulness meet in a productive way. I wish you all the best, kind person.
mvtbun,,gvgdayq,Yeah, 8 months in an apartment of my own, I still note cool places to park/live.
mvtbun,gveje4j,,Rudi!!!!!! I don‚Äôt know if you remember me, PM me??   It is SOOOO good to hear from you!   I wish I had something, anything, to share with you. I‚Äôve missed you so much.
mvtbun,gveok68,,Wow! Your story is inspirational. Can you provide more details of how you overcame homelessness in a year? Also what line of work are you in?
mvtbun,,gvexvg9,I didn't do anything particularly special. I got here May 1 of last year, as covid was shutting down California. I kinda squatted in the attic of a vacant house for a few months, and found work right away- one place bottling hand sanitizer, and the other job flipping burgers. I did those for a couple months, and didn't really have much to spend my earnings ok, so I was able to save some. Then, I found work in my field (waiting tables). Didnt help that by then, LA was shutting down its restaurants again, but I managed to scrape by on what I was making. Its a high end place, so once we got going again, my earnings went thru the roof. I managed to move into a cheap place, and kept saving. Now, im "stable", I've got a decent little savings, a place and a car again. Yet, my instinct is to run. I just don't understand it. Maybe I'm not made for human contact or civilization at all??
mvtbun,,gvfpfr0,Maybe talk to a therapist to help understand what you're running from and develop strategies to deal with it.   You can incorporate travel into a stable life if that's what you crave.
mvtbun,,gvfaybp,Hey OP, this is really inspiring ‚Äî thanks for sharing your story.  Did you consider living outside a city, perhaps in a small town, a village or in a secluded place ‚Äî if you can travel?  Cities are not really suitable for living in anymore IMHO.
mvtbun,,gvg5ilh,Congratulations Rudi, I'm glad you're doing well. Have you seen the film Nomadland? It's about a woman who's running away from her grief and the things she gives up because of it. Your story reminds me of that film. Maybe if you see it, you'll find that you're not alone.
mvtbun,,gvf1mkz,Are you making six figures as a server?   I can relate. I've been battling depression from childhood trauma so I have a desire to get away. I've relocated cross country three times within five years and five more times within those cities. I left California last year during the pandemic. No job and about to lose my place to live due to a psycho roommate. No one would help me. I felt disconnected while living there and people were disingenuous which caused my mental health to decline rapidly. The majority of people I encountered were flaky, toxic or just plain users. I moved back down south to live with a relative and my mental health is slowly getting better. I also feel connected which is something I've haven't felt in years.
mvtbun,,gvf1t1g,Ya, I work two jobs now, and between them, I do pretty well- especially for someone in the hospitality business.   But I do miss the south. Wish I could go back home.
mvtbun,,gvgitqi,The food and beverage industry is what helped me get off the streets too.  I don't know what part of the South you're from, but I'm in Charleston, SC and I know that most restaurants here are desperate for FOH and BOH staff right now.  I don't know about a six figure salary, but you might be able to do something like that in some of the fine dining restaurants here.   I don't have any experience with those kinds of places.  I just worked the tourists traps for the most part.  I would imagine that the cost of living here is a lot lower than what you experience in LA though so maybe you wouldn't need quite as much?   Just a thought if you're really homesick.
mvtbun,,gvgj3g7,I had actually considered that. Someplace along the coast, Charleston or Savannah. I lived in Spartanburg like 15 years ago.
mvtbun,,gvgqzet,Charleston is a beautiful, hospitable city.  I probably picked a really good spot to wind up homeless in.  Lots of tourists made it easy to blend in in a relatively small town and there were plenty of jobs once I got some ID issues sorted.    If you come here to work though, be aware that the tourist season dies off swiftly at the end of December and the town remains relatively empty until about the beginning of April.  Three months wherein your income will be a small fraction of what it was in the spring, summer, and fall.  It's almost like a winter vacation.  You need to save some of what you make in the busier months to survive the winter.  It trips a lot of people up, especially younger kids who don't realize the lull is coming.  It's not really a problem if you just save a bit.  There's more than enough money to be made during the busy parts of the year.
mvtbun,gvgfpvb,,I was homeless for 8 months in 2006 and I still look at a spot every once in a while and size it up and store it away in the back of my mind as a good spot.  Your mileage may vary, but fifteen years and I still do that.    For the first couple of years after getting a roof back over my head I would sometimes have thoughts of going back.  For me it was more of a fall back plan, along the lines of well, if it gets too bad, if this falls through, if I don't have what it takes, I can always do that.  I can survive homelessness.  The truth is I was exhausted, emotionally and physically by the time it was over.  For me to seriously entertain the thought of doing it again was beyond unrealistic.  That's me though.  Things might be different for someone else.  The thing that changed it for me was a dog.  I adopted a dog.  Once I fell in love with and became responsible for her I sort of let go of that notion of homelessness as my default.  That just didn't seem like the kind of life that I wanted her to have and I was determined to do the best I could for this creature that I dearly loved and had taken responsibility for.  My plans slowly became a little more constructive I think and I started facing head on some things that I had been avoiding.  It just took time.  I had to be willing to call myself out when my thoughts became negative and destructive and learn how to channel that energy into positive efforts.  It sounds very cliched I know, but it helped me.
mvtbun,gvel77y,,That's why you find a job where you can travel.... Tis why i drive truck
mvtbun,,gveqc5h,Good call, but I don't have a CDL, and I'm too old now to be selling bibles door to door lol
mvtbun,,gvhu4pt,I was homeless when I got my CDL. I was living in my pathfinder.  You can go to your state (u don't know I'm in the midwest I don't know how it is out anywhere else) for Workforce placement training and they'll basically pay your way to get a CDL or some other kind of job training
mvtbun,gvf5gfo,,This is me. I was only homeless for less than a year, but I always take note of abandoned homes for squatting or going places to park and sleep. I have a nice little apartment with some furniture and 2 dogs now. My work is as plentiful as I want it and pay is good. But you never quite shake the feeling.
mvtbun,gveh78e,,Your body just wants to run from mundane life, from a routine
mvtbun,gvhguk0,,No. It never does. I'm 9 years out of living in my car. I still look for good places to park. I still try to be a minimalist. Keeping my life down to a carload of possessions. I got out of being homeless through work and family. But I changed...  I am not the same. I got old and sick. I don't go out much except to the doctor or therapist. I live with family. So many things are better. But in my mind... I'm still alone. I don't want to be around people anymore. I feel like this world is a prison. The life I once had is inconceivable. I don't want a significant other. I don't want the rat race. I don't want to jump through hoops anymore for anyone for any reason. I just want to do my time.   I'm safe. At least for now.
mvtbun,gvfsf6b,,I feel that for most everything. I'm doing alright now but Ive been housed a year and I'm not buying stuff and what I do have is packed.  Ready to jet.
mvtbun,gvg20pb,,Six figures damn
mvtbun,gviz8il,,You miss the freedom
mvvapf,gvehvs2,,This isn't woke, this is bigoted to immigrants.

mvm56p,gvcqlgw,,Excerpt:   > U.S. District Judge David O. Carter‚Äôs order Tuesday requiring Los Angeles city and county officials to offer shelter to the entire population of skid row by mid-October is a brash, bold move ‚Äî and possibly marks a turning point in the enduring, shameful saga of homelessness in downtown Los Angeles.  > It was a kick in the pants to local elected officials that is sure to be cheered by many, especially those who want public spaces cleared of sprawling encampments, not just on skid row, but across our tent-draped metropolis.  > So hear, hear, for a judge who is saying loud and clear that if politicians can‚Äôt do their jobs, he‚Äôll pound his gavel, flap his robes, take to the streets himself and show them how it‚Äôs done.  > But before anyone gets too carried away in celebration, I feel compelled to point out that Carter‚Äôs judicial activism and gavel-pounding bravado ‚Äî while well-intentioned, I‚Äôm sure ‚Äî presents more than a few big, vexing questions.  > How exactly do you move a few thousand people off the streets in just a few months, including those with severe mental illness and/or addiction issues?  > Where do you put them when the inconvenient reality for several years has been, hey, even if we could address the medical and mental health needs of these folks, we don‚Äôt have anywhere to put them?  > Who pays for it all?  > And if skid row gets swept clean, where do you think all the people who live there now but aren‚Äôt ready or willing to move into temporary quarters, are going to end up?  > I‚Äôm not much of a gambler, but I‚Äôd bet you that a lot of them are going to simply relocate to another neighborhood somewhere in Los Angeles.
mvm56p,gve1xc7,,You can't just legislate the human condition, especially that element of it.
mue7n4,gv5bq5q,,I understand completely. Not being able to use a restroom at will as needed is extremely problematic, not to mention humiliating. Sometimes you can't wait. I don't have any real solutions but what does help a little is using the restroom at every opportunity whether or not you need to at that moment. Kinda like when you are little and parents insist you potty before getting in the car to go places.
mue7n4,gv5fmrm,,Not having a restroom is literally the worst. I am so sorry.
mue7n4,gv5bgoh,,It can only come up from here man. I had to watch for my buddy while he was shitting in the Bronx once. Just snuck up on him. I hope you find a place to dry off.
mue7n4,gv5efon,,I‚Äôm so sorry you went through that ü•∫
mue7n4,gv5dfr7,,I hear you. And having to plan where you sleep based on if it's a place you can safely piss and shit or is at least close to one
mue7n4,,gv5jert,Yup. Nights are always problematic when places are closed, and it‚Äôs all homes around. I could never figure that one out. How do you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Sleeping in a car is one thing, and bathrooms a whole a lot of other thing.
mue7n4,,gv691dd,Pee bottle for sure. Bit more difficult for women. And a bucket with garbage bags and some cat litter for number 2. Some good window covers don't hurt either.
mue7n4,,gv7jp7v,Those screw-tip tupperware designed for soup work as pee bottles for folks without penises and if you buy the good ones won't leak if they tip over. You gotta wash them out instead of just tossing them, but it's a workable solution.
mue7n4,,gva86jy,Finding a place to use a piss bottle safely is hit and miss, much less a shit bucket. And don't even get me started on finding a place to get rid of it without being harassed by cops even more than usual
mue7n4,gv5jies,,I‚Äôm sorry.
mue7n4,gv5slcy,,One thing I learned was to change my diet, when I ate so I'd always need to poop during business hours.
mue7n4,gv5yc1m,,There's nothing wrong with being forced to take a shit in a ditch.  Nothing like that can "degrade" a person.  Embarrassment may be unavoidable but not has no bearing on your true worth.  I hope you get regular access to a bathroom for the sake of comfort.  Don't feel bad about yourself.
mue7n4,gv5e3s4,,I just shit on a gas station yesterday because they said no homeless allowed to use restroom. I also told em do to this i was just going to shit on the back of the building guess they didnt believe me.

mue7n4,gv63cqb,,Walmart, Bass Pro and many other places have cheap "camp toilets" which you may want to look into.

mue7n4,,gv7t9a1,Also known as honey buckets. Worth their weight in gold.
mue7n4,gv6w5lk,,one of the reasons why i avoid a lot of carb-rich foods when i'm car living or roughing it outside - its good to time your feeding window from like 11-5 so you can use the rest room around 9 and be good for the rest of the night. Food like taco bell and mcdonalds are just completely off the table unless you've found yourself a good 24 hour laundromat or porta potty at a local park close by
mue7n4,gv7whh7,,Nobody saw it so it wasn‚Äôt degrading !
mue7n4,gv83m7l,,Always carry TP! Anyway, sorry you had a rough night. I have been there many times but since I grew up camping as a kid it didn't seem too horrible.  What's funny is that after being a vagabond for years I got into construction, where bathrooms tend to be, well, under construction much of the time and a porta potty is a rare luxury. Fortunately nature was generally gentle with me (I gave up coffee for this reason) but construction dudes can be pretty gross sometimes when it comes to this situation. So there's no shame, shit happens.
mue7n4,gv5v1po,,Err.. This doesn't make what you went thru any less shitty (sorry for the bad pun too) but if you're doing vehicle living, there's the kitty litter and a sealable bucket method. I also have reflectix to cover all my windows.
mue7n4,,gv7b1f1,Thats a waste of a bucket
mue7n4,,gv7cs9o,It's come in handy for me. I have crohns disease and have to poop several times a day, sometimes even in an hour.  And yeah, you reuse the bucket.
mue7n4,,gv7d9ei,Usually people leave the bucket with shit in it wherever they please.  Most people dont have that problem and still make a mess.  Bury your shit
mue7n4,,gv7p3ez,Oh yeah, that's gross and shitty of them to just leave it. But I can understand not everyone has a shovel, I certainly don't. But treating it like a human litter box with scooping and bagging then trashing wasn't the worst thing. I learned about the method from burners.
mue7n4,,gv7tqxy,Use leak-proof trash bags. Can still line it with a bit of litter, oil dry (same stuff), or paper towels to absorb any liquids and keep splashing down and make clean up easy.
mue7n4,gv6wcgv,,I had to pee one night, and since COVID, everything is closed, even my former 24 hr gas stations. So, I‚Äôm at my local sleep spot, it‚Äôs 3 am, I‚Äôm squatting...and surprise poop. For some reason...it just depresses me even further. I feel your pain, my friend.
mue7n4,gv7apz5,,Burry your shit!  You didnt bury your shit! Thats the most horrific part of your story  Always bury your shit
mue7n4,,gv7ewnz,Lol i cleaned it up in the morning. At least what was left to clean up anyway. The ditch was flooded

mt9t7b,,guzhix1,What programs do you imagine you will qualify for? You have 21,000 dollars in stocks. 40% of americans don't have money for a $400 emergency.  This post is almost offensive really... liquidate and get a lease.
mt9t7b,,guzhv59,Totally agree.
mt9t7b,,guzrewz,$21k is enough to liquidate, lease, and STILL have emergency money leftover.

mt9t7b,guyrgxo,,If you have 21k than you shouldn‚Äôt be paying for a hotel.  Liquidate enough to pay for the deposit and down payment on a long-term lease and invest the rest.

It's pretty expensive and literally all my paycheck goes to paying my weekly rates....But I'm getting a place soon through rapid rehousing. The only advice I can give is to look for a CES caseworker. Sometimes they give motel vouchers, place you in transitional living, or help you find a permanent place to stay.
mt9t7b,guyspxu,,I consider renting a lesser form of indentured servitude.  You two can break the chains by learning to live outside the norm.  Consider getting a van or cheap RV.  If you‚Äôre near water, boats are a wonderful way to get free.  Depending upon climate, even a bicycle and tent can keep you mobile, away from the crowds, dry and comfortable.  Such changes take some getting used to, but once established the rewards are uplifting!  Good luck and God bless!!!

I have 1.2k spending money right now not including other assets in apps. Just so you guys know the whole background. My boyfriend just filed taxes and should be getting his unemployment as well.

mt9t7b,,guzboxa,What are you doing? Liquidate and get somewhere to live. You have more money in savings than the average american. Stop larping as homeless. You can buy a cheap trailer in large swaths of the US for way less money than you have.

mtllhf,gv1f28q,,I would say that what contributes to homelessness is low wages and High Cost of Living!
mtllhf,gv0sfty,,Homeless dude in a legal state.  I smoke about 2 or 3 grams of flower a day, which is a out $10 a day.   I smoked before being homeless, and are homeless because of PTSD and a bad family.   We get more people here for access to hard drugs than cannabis. (Decriminalized)  The majority of those who come here for access to cannabis run to a warmer location once they realize that winter here sucks. (Trimmigrants, travelers and gutter punks. Aka dirty kids)  Some people manage to get clean through willpower and weed, but not many and not often.  Also, with legalization comes destigmatization. I see people in professional attire enjoying a joint or vape on break. NOBODY drug tests for cannabis for entry level low paying jobs, so it's not an obstacle to employment.  So if you're asking, "Are more people homeless because of weed?"  The answer is NO
mtllhf,,gv17olx,Appreciate your views.  As I said, I was wondering if weed makes the *climb out of homelessness* harder.  A big part of that climb is working 40 hours a week.
mtllhf,gv1pbua,,When CO first legalized weed, they had a glut of homeless people showing up to the state and it was a strain on the social services there from what I remember reading. It's easily searchable the problems they had with people just showing up there with no plan but to smoke weed.  On a side barb: I've smoked weed forever and I would just hold money aside for it, not worrying about other expenses and always making sure I had enough money for it.   I have a friend who's in the same boat. He buys 3x as much weed as I but is able to manage to pay for his apartment based on Door Dashing alone. He's been struggling, though.
mtllhf,,h1f61ob,> It's easily searchable the problems they had with people just showing up there with no plan but to smoke weed.  Can confirm. I live in CO. And the people who flocked here just to smoke weed all fucking day and then beg for money so they wouldn't have to get a real job was insane.  I'll be totally happy when every state legalizes so people can stay the fuck away from my town.
mtoi6e,gv2my2z,,Honesty I was homeless on and off between 20-23 after my dad died and it was TRAUMATIC. You think people would have sympathy when youre young and on the street..but they don't. They treat you really bad and it really screws you up mentally.  I hid it from my friends. I would shoplift clean clothes just so i didnt look dirty.. I would rub down with soap and sneak into the hotel hot tub so i could wash.  When a friend dropped me off or picked me up, i had them bring me to an apartment complex down the street from my shelter so they wouldn't know i was on the streets.  It's really hard and it causes PTSD. Even a short period is enough to really change how you look at the world, so just try to listen and lend an ear because it sounds like hes having a hard time.
mq0vt5,gud88z5,,Get a time consuming hobby like sewing or painting.  Fill your mind with that stuff.
mq0vt5,,gudfsjk,I did find one thing that consumes a lot of time. It is live baby kitten webcam streams on YouTube, there are several of them. I can lay in bed and watch them for hours but the problem is I have a really hard time staying off chat. Whenever I do say anything on chat somebody tells me I'm doing something wrong or starts an argument and it's just the same as anywhere else on the internet and is just so pathetic and sad that that's the only place I can go because I know as soon as I get into conflict with anybody I'm going to start crying at least the internet people can't see me and I'm not as embarrassed
mq0vt5,,gug40e2,Adopt a cat!!
mq0vt5,,gudfk16,I did try hobbies and I have stuff for all the Hobbies I used to love but it's so hard to stick with it. I don't enjoy it. I get fidgety and I just want to get on Reddit and talk about my hobby instead. It's without fail this has happened. I was coloring a mandala coloring book I got frustrated with it and go online to talk about coloring markers for example. Or I was playing with my cat and he did something cute so I took a picture to put on Reddit because I love hearing back from people who like what I have to put out there. I just don't know the right place. It's like when I do put myself out there nobody wants what I have to offer or they tell me I'm too sensitive. I'm broke down crying when I public these days it's so sad because I was tough cookie when I was out on the street
mq0vt5,,guex681,Might want to look around discord and find some like minded groups to chat with about stuff. I mean before places like imgur and reddit existed many of us sat around blabbin in icq for hours everynight.
mq0vt5,gudcgtg,,If you‚Äôre getting a lot of your social interaction from Reddit, then I might suggest that you Unfollow negative Reddit subforums. Ones that talk about politics or divisive issues. You can get your news about politics from published sources instead‚Äîfor a while at least.  There are a lot of subReddits that have a goal of supporting people or of being positive, and it‚Äôs possible to read through those without it feeling like you are just avoiding real life. Examples are r/CongratsLikeImFive and r/MomForAMinute. A nice thing about going to subReddits like those is that one way to build community and start to feel better about yourself is by supporting other people. It might feel a little hollow at first, but I do think it‚Äôs helpful.  I‚Äôve run out of time and can‚Äôt write more but I will quick say it‚Äôs also nice to just have some good mood subreddits it‚Äôs like r/aww or r/oddlysatisfying to have low effort enjoyment.
mq0vt5,gud6qbs,,Im so sorry about your situation im sure its tough too! Mean people on the internet are terrible but i think you came to the right sub! This sub is filled with many good people x idk where you are based but i looove making new friends!! Dm me anytime if you wanna talk! About anything!!! Everything will be okay x dont be hard on yourself! Give yourself time to adjust. Go walk around in target, eat ice cream, do things that make you happy etc. take care of yourself
mq0vt5,gud7yir,,I'm an Atheist, not religious at all. Sometimes, I still go to church, though. It's just nice to be around positive messages and sing/interact with people. Plus, it's free. If I am approached and asked if I want to pray or take communion, I politely say "i'm really just here today because I needed fellowship and to see people being happy. Thank you for asking/offering, though." No one has asked me to leave or said a negative word. The reaction was always "Thank you for coming. We're glad we could be here for you."  It may not sound like much, but it really can be a morale boost when you feel completely disconnected and someone shakes your hand and says "Hello and welcome!"  Edit to add: ok, no hand shaking anymore, but you get my point.
mq0vt5,,guderfb,Yesss! I always try to engage with the elderly and children, because they really appreciate your company and it's super rewarding. Somehow church falls into the same "safe people to communicate with" cathegory.
mq0vt5,guda1zm,,If I didn‚Äôt get pregnant I might be exactly where you‚Äôre at right now. I had to pull it together enough to function for my boy, but your post absolutely hits a spot for me. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre in this position OP. I‚Äôm so sorry that your therapist right now is failing you and that you feel alone. I still have the social anxiety and PTSD- sometimes I pass camps when I‚Äôm driving somewhere and it brings back almost nostalgic memories of waiting until dark to hunker in a slide on a playground. I‚Äôm also not in therapy (though I desperately need to be), mostly because of where I‚Äôm at financially.   I‚Äôve found things that bring me happy. Herbalism, marine life (all my fish haha), gardening. They all ground me. I know money is an issue, but chat with your case worker and see if there‚Äôs maybe a hobby good for you. Some don‚Äôt even require money- herbalism can save money if you forage and go ‚Äúhunting‚Äù for different plants! Reading is free if there‚Äôs a library nearby. Journaling is always good.   You‚Äôre not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è
mq0vt5,,gudfbyt,It's weird. I know I'm experiencing depression again now because I have a apartment full of hobbies and I just don't want to do any of them. I can barely even play with my cat and cats are my life. Or I guess they used to be. I relate to what you said hardcore about going past camps and feeling nostalgic. I sometimes have this temptation to go sit in my car in the places I used to hang out waiting for dark. to go park across from the shelter where I used to eat lunch every day and see the familiar faces but not have to worry about them coming up to me asking for cigarettes because they don't know it's me and I actually quit smoking cigarettes by myself but I don't know I just can't seem to find any joy in anything.
mq0vt5,,gudu9yw,Good on your for quitting nic! It‚Äôs hard. I had packs too for awhile- I went from being homeless to working at a center as a peer advocate (kinda like you right??) so it was my stress relief. The depression stuff is tricky because really I haven‚Äôt figured it out myself. I have highs and lows. Maybe a new thing will kick things back into gear for you, or maybe switching up your routine or your environment? I can tell when I‚Äôm going through an episode because I have absolutely no appetite.  Being homeless gives you an entirely different outlook on the world that no one else around us has. It‚Äôs almost addictive because of that. A lot of people who are chronically homeless don‚Äôt mind anymore because all of their needs are met- I think that‚Äôs why we kinda ‚Äòmiss‚Äô it sometimes. I think of it the same way I think about a toxic relationship. Sometimes I think about an ex and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúman I miss him‚Äù and then I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúHOLD UP, dude was manipulative and not good for you even if you didn‚Äôt feel it‚Äù. But they‚Äôre both tempting things. So yeah.  But hey- if you ever wanna talk my messages are open.
mq0vt5,,guhbytu,Do you like to read? You should check out The Body Keeps the Score.
mq0vt5,gue5arn,,Have you looked into free 12 step meetings that are meeting on Zoom?  There are sub Reddit‚Äôs that can help you locate these.
mq0vt5,,guf8j9c,I came here to suggest the same thing. I'm a big advocate of AA; it helped me get sober, I made some great friends, always had somewhere to go (there are meetings all over town all hours of the day and night), could talk if I wanted or not if I didn't, the coffee sucks  but it's free and it doesn't cost anything to attend. I also found that when I couldn't talk or didn't want to say anything and I listened, I heard other people describe parts of my story. If I was feeling down I could always find someone who was in a worse situation; if I was on top of the world, I had plenty of people reminding me that humility is a virtue.   I also want to say that there are plenty of people in all kinds of houses--from tiny apartments to huge mansions--who have the same emptiness and insecurity and self-doubt you describe. One foot in front of the other, rest when you need it, and never, ever, be afraid to reach out for help. You're not alone, and you're as worthy as any other human being on the planet. Good luck.
mq0vt5,,gug91yi,I was going to make the same suggestion. I started going back to AlAnon meetings a couple of months ago, all on Zoom... and there are actually benefits to it over in-person meetings since you can literally get on one at any time... I tell people they should do them even if they haven‚Äôt been affected by another persons drinking (though who hasn‚Äôt?!?) because it‚Äôs just so helpful in so many aspects of your life. There‚Äôs so many options for 12 step programs there may be some that are better fit than others... but it‚Äôs literally free therapy... maybe even better than therapy.
mq0vt5,gude7uw,,Rooting for you, friend.
mq0vt5,gudeby3,,Heey, nice to hear that you are trying hard. I'd like to let you know that ALL thing you say are definitely not homeless person problems, but personal problems. Most people experience fall-back fear. I thought I will fall hard back to depression after I lost a job, but I managed to stay focused on opportunities rather than fears.   To make it easier let me draw you a picture: Your fear is a pink elephant. it's so big and bright, you just can not not think about it. In your mind, it gets bigger and bigger and brighter and even more difficult to ignore. What I do, is place my pink elephant into a BIG forest, mountain scenery whatever. the forest is a representation of opportunities. If I give room to my elephant, I will end up thinking about a river that runs through the mountain, and I will have time to notice pretty flowers there too. basically, the point is to acknowledge that the Pink elephant exists, and leave him be. In the mean time - take a walk in the forest, go as far as you need to not see the elephant anymore.
mq0vt5,gudgq1t,,Hey OP, this all sounds so tough. I want you to know that I'm cheering you on and proud of you for all you've overcome, no matter what. Being isolated and on top of everything with COVID makes it even harder. Do you have any games you play? Maybe joining a Discord server where you can game with people online would help you feel connected to the outside world.   Something that has helped me a lot is meditation. The other day I felt myself slipping into a dark place and I was able to recognize it and pull myself out of it, it was pretty amazing and one of the first times I've been able to do that. You can get a free one year subscription to the Sam Harris meditation app which I currently use, and the Headspace app is quite good as well.   Sending you unconditional love and support.
mq0vt5,gugaa9l,,I get it. I was homeless for a bit and 100% get what you're saying. I think of it as being land sick; you're used to so much commotion and now that it's a bit calmer, you don't know what to do with yourself. You're too broke to have fun but so lonely. It's been over ten years since I've "domesticated" and I'm still finding how life long poverty and 10 years adrift is affecting me. I just realized that my default setting is anxiety two months ago. I just thought everyone was hyper vigilant and crawling out of their skin. Here are a few things that worked/are working for me:   Find something you actually enjoy doing. Something small at first, like just sitting by a window and enjoying the sun. Do it at least once a day. Make time for that little thing. Savor the moment and the thing. Try not to find reasons not to enjoy it. Love it for what it is. Eventually, I was able to do and actually enjoy bigger things. There's still work to be done, but it's progress.   On that note, celebrate your victories no matter how small they seem. You made and ate breakfast? Fantastic! You did a thing! There were times you couldn't do it but now you can. Enjoy that victory. You started laundry? Awesome! Even if you don't finish it, you have laundry to do and you have the means to do it. Relish that. You get to have a warm blankie when it's done and you can cocoon yourself the rest of the day.   Try not to belittle those victories. "I only started laundry." "I ate but the food was shit." "I only managed to get through the day without panicking. I didn't do anything else." "These are things normal people /should/ be doing. The small task isn't worth celebrating." These are all things that, yes, should be done and yes, are small given the scope of life, but given the weight your carrying and the constant battle with yourself, they're no small victories. One thing I started about 5 or so years into domestication was to try and eliminate the word "but" and other qualifiers from my vocabulary when talking to and about myself. They only made me feel shitty and less motivated to do anything. I started saying and thinking things like, "I stayed laundry today. It might not get done today but there's always tomorrow. What else am I going to do?" "I ate. It wasn't what I should have ate but at least I'm in a functional state and was delicious." "I managed to get through today without panicking. What an odd sensation." "These small, 'insignificant' tasks are are done and I don't have to worry about them until next time. With what I've been through, I'm glad those things are smaller in comparison to some other things." Each victory, no matter how small, is a victory. Allow yourself to enjoy it.   Realize that what you've been through is not the norm and that you've made it this far. Your path going to seem more arduous that it seems for other people. It is. Most people haven't gone through what you have. "Simple" tasks can be intimidating, scary, and hard as hell for you. That's the trauma at work. I visualize it as weights or chains restricting my movement. The more you fight against them, the more tired your going to get. You're better off trying to figure out how to take them off than trying to just pull against them.  Take some time for honest and open introspection. You recognize you're scared but what of? Why are you scared of that? Answers like "I'm scared of the dark because it's scary" don't count. What specifically makes the dark scary? "I'm afraid of vampires." Do vampires exist? "No." Then there's something else. "I'm afraid of being attacked." That's a valid concern. Is there anything you can do about it now? "Yes. Be aware of my surroundings and be ready to run." Or if there's nothing that can be done about a thing right that minute, I make a loose plan to do something about it. That kind of thing. Holding myself accountable but not judging and being honest with myself helped more than just about anything.   Speak to yourself as you would a good friend. When you're belittling your successes, imagine a good friend or relative saying those things to you and say to yourself what you would say to then. I've only recently started talking to myself as I would to my daughter. I feel so much better. I still berate myself, but not as much and I catch myself doing it more often.   Hang in there. You're stronger than you think. Not many people would get as far as you have and be as put together. I think of it as a qualifying race where everyone else got a head start and doesn't have to wear a suit of armor. Just because you're a little behind doesn't mean you can't catch up. Eventually the armor will fall off/be cast off, you'll get a little momentum, and start making gains. Don't compare yourself to anyone else, however. The odds aren't even and if they were, you'd still be a positive outlier by virtue of where you started, have been, and are going.   It gets better but it takes time and some days will be better than others. Just celebrate the victories, dispassionately analyze the defeats, learn, grow, and flourish.   Best of luck to you. <3
mq0vt5,,gugsh0m,Love your words. I Hope many people read your comment.
mq0vt5,,guhmnff,Thank you. I'll reply to one part here. I have had lots of time to introspect about the anxiety of going out among people. I do know there are two factors. I could go join the volunteer group at the homeless Outreach church that used to serve me on the street. I actually really respect the pastor but she is in incredibly busy lady. I have some boundaries book by John Townsend and Henry cloud of hers to return to her :-) the nervousness of rejoining that group of people is seeing some of the old homeless people I used to know and being terrified that they are going to take advantage of me now that I have nice things. That's one part of it and that definitely come from past experience. The option of going out among strangers even grocery shopping is a different thing. I'm terrified that they are going to judge me and know that I was once a homeless drug addict who did Terrible Things. That fear is more irrational because I passed for a non homeless person most of the time because I had a certain level of privilege and people didn't know until I told them. Now I have a nicer car and I'm more hygienic and there's absolutely no reason anybody would know but I just feel like an imposter going and doing normal things. It's really weird. The third thing may not be anxiety it may be fatigued. For some reason the effort of taking a shower to go to the store will wear me out and I will get back in bed after taking a shower. And I won't go to the store without taking a shower because I just get really self-conscious. This is the Ozarks, a lot of people will go to the store without a bra and without even putting on real clothes or combing their hair but I can't do that. I know it's an option but I don't know, I was raised differently
mq0vt5,,gujr0em,I get anxious at the store, too. I would dress nicely and try to take someone with me to deflect those feelings (which I didn't realize I did until my girlfriend and her kid stopped going with me) by making jokes and having conversation. I can do it on my own without that panicky tunnel vision but it took months and still isn't 100%. But I have gotten to the point where if I know what I'm getting, I'll wear slippers and pajama pants, go straight to the item, and use self check out. I try to tell myself that I'll never see these people ever again, that they don't care, if they do care, I wouldn't want to talk to them anyway, and stay focused on the task at hand. CBD helped a **lot** until it started giving me heart palpitations. It's expensive and finding the right dose and medium is trial and error but if you can, get some low dosage tincture, gummies, or pills and take as directed every 2-4 hours, increasing the dose by 1 serving unit until you got it dialed in. It's done wonders for me overall.   I totally get the energy part. Man... do I ever. If it was just me, I'd succumb to it all the time but the kid is 14 and the lady has a degenerative spine thing so if I don't do it, it won't get done. I've found spite to be a good short term motivator. Just doing things to tell my anxiety and depression "fuck you, I'm the boss" still doesn't feel great but at least it got done.   Two pieces by Wil Wheaton helped with depression and just soldering on. http://wilwheaton.net/2012/09/depression-lies/ and http://wilwheaton.net/2017/07/depression-still-lies/  But you gotta' find what works for you and recognize and celebrate when progress has been made. If you'd like, you can post the trials and successes in r/posthomelessness. I started it in the hopes of supporting others and finding ways to deal with my own experience. It hasn't taken off but I keep it around just in case someone else finds something of value. Again, best of luck to you. <3
mq0vt5,guddn4c,,All good, compassionate, tips for feeling better. Your story is not so rare and I relate. Many options out there you may not be able to see. Physical exercise is HUGE help. Try some walks around a park or if you can get to a hiking trail. Try some yoga on YouTube. Search around for something interesting and turn away from upsetting content/comments. You can get better. You want to or you wouldn‚Äôt have posted. I believe you can do it. Please check back in. üåø
mq0vt5,gudowuz,,This is SO normal. I went through the same thing. And I still have many of those feelings.. the thing I've learned about mental health and addiction is that it's a full time job taking care of it.   Have you told your case worker you need more help? There's also all kinds of meetings (I know it's hard with covid).. anyways personally aa and na didn't work for me, but it's a great start to make some relationships with ppl who are genuine and in the same place as you. If that doesn't work, there's lots of other recovery based meetings you can check out. If you need help with some resources, msg me and I can help you  Just don't give in. Remember how far youve come. Find some things you enjoy, a good movie, a nice bath, good food. And do that everyday. üñ§  Edit: just went through your profile, msg me and we can talk 90 day fiance. I also have ptsd and have been sober now for a year (I had almost 5 and relapsed)... But your not alone okay ‚ù§Ô∏è
mq0vt5,,gudt3uc,Yes I had my caseworker meeting this morning and she is going to come visit me again one more time this week. I told her all about how mean people are in the 90 Day Fiance threads and she out of herself as a 90-day watch as well. We discussed some of this stuff. It's still all fresh on my mind. I feel like I've been having PMS for months. Everything just makes me want to cry or run and hide just thinking about it. This is massively different than my previous anxiety which was about very specific things. As far as meetings and stuff we talked about activities and groups as well as support groups in recovery groups that are available that I didn't realize had opened up I spend a lot of stuff we still shut down at my agency due to cope with. Sorry about voice to text I'm talking too fast. I told her that depending on the activity I might be interested in going to some groups there again. However I've had a lot of bad experiences in the recovery groups during my time as a homeless person I would go to every single Recovery Group there was just to have a place to sit during the day. I was one of those people that they hate for that reason. I got treated kind of poorly for that and some of them and in others I just found that the people there were really intimidating and scary. I didn't connect that with the symptoms I'm having now but it's the same feeling about going back out into the world. I don't know where to go to have like safe child-proof experiences because I feel like a small child right now.
mq0vt5,,gudtfjz,This city sucks. There are only a few groups still operating, I just looked them up and they're all the ones that my ex still goes to. He is still homeless and on the street and I have had to ask him never to contact me again because of some complicated history. It's a small enough City to where there is a high chance that I will run into him if I go to one of those and I just I just can't do that. I used to go to church at this one Church where the pastor is the one who does homeless Outreach here in the city. She kept me fed and clothed but she still serves all the homeless people every day and if I go to her church I'm going to see him there too
mq0vt5,gudwc85,,My mother never did well Alone as she got older. Her mental health did not go well when she had her own apartment. I will tell you that I had to give up control of trying to help her stay in apartments or group living. She loved being in the shelter with the freedom to come and go. The social activist and all the services available.  If it not working for you let your social worker know and maybe you need to be in a group home setting.
mq0vt5,,gudwnpv,100% self-aware and experience to knowthat I will not do well in a group home setting. But my caseworker and I are talking about some of the structured activities at the agency that they have recently opened back up to the public. Things were really stripped-down for covid-19 I have been out of the loop since I got my apartment. I'm also being offered a vaccine to so there are some positives
mq0vt5,guf6bir,,You have a good case of survivor's guilt and you're waiting for the other shoe to drop and to fail. I get that.  But you're being way too hard on yourself. We are in the middle of a pandemic.  You're doing extraordinarily well considering. This is not normal times and nobody expects you to be perfect.  I would suggest some breathing exercises for the anxiety and mediation 2x daily. Go out and just walk out in the fresh air till your head clears.  It's the anxiety that's making you think you will fail so work on that first. I'm currently on an anti anxiety med and I've never had to take one before that's how bad this past year has been. It's not just you. Everybody is in freak out I'm gonna crash and burn mode. You can hardly  breathe and not worry about something bad happening right now. It's not just the best time for people with anxiety disorder.  You're ahead of the game. You're clean and you have a roof. Just try to breathe and take it one day, one hour at a time if necessary. You've got this. ü§óü§óü§ó
mq0vt5,gufwp5j,,It's ok to be miserable - please don't add to your misery by blaming yourself for feeling down. It's ok. Stay in bed. Relax in it, you need it. You can be physically comfortable, and still be miserable. It's ok. Be kind to yourself. It takes time.  Beating yourself up over needing to recover and heal is such a trap to fall into, putting the feeling of 'failure to be fixed' on top of everything you are already suffering. I wish you all the best, and hope you can rest and regenerate. Take a breath and forgive yourself. üå±
mq0vt5,gudw1l4,,Can I suggest four square breathing. It works very well to get a little edge in.
mq0vt5,,gudwzup,Yes this is one of those things I use when I need to. I haven't had to in awhile but back when things kept triggering me on the street this was helpful only if I could get somewhere private with no distractions. That was often the biggest problem with basic coping tools oh, I could not concentrate if somebody was watching me do them and criticizing me which was usually how it worked out. I'm realizing I had almost nothing but really toxic social interactions in all my time out on the street. It has really made its imprint on me even though I know it's not like that out there in the world necessarily I've now got the badge of somebody who has seen some s***.
mq0vt5,guecx1u,,Get off the internet for awhile. Go to a library and pick up some books. Find free clubs (outdoor, single, chess, etc). They do exist.
mq0vt5,gueyiak,,This isn't going to fix anything, but it might [help a little](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tetris-shown-to-lessen-ptsd-and-flashbacks/).    Anxiety is a killer. Isolation is too. Give yourself a pat on the back for being sober this long, that's way more than what most people can do.
mq0vt5,,guhopoe,LOL. That explains why I made it through homelessness. I used to use the word Tetris as a verb. I was tetrising my bags and boxes in my trunk every day
mq0vt5,gufu4ty,,You arent alone. My problem readjusting is not the same as yours. But it is with readjusting none the less. The path you're on is better than the path you were on. It's currently problematic but it is still the right path. Stay safe.
mq0vt5,gufue1q,,I feel like I can relate to a lot of what you are saying.  I am also sober (5 yrs) from long term alcohol abuse and have a decent place to live, working from home now but I struggle a LOT with anxiety and other mental health issues.  One thing that I like to do is to create a to-do list every single day (I do mine in excel, you could use google sheets or just paper/pen).  Some of the items are really basic like "floss teeth" or something like that, but what I am kinda going for is a list of activities that will take me through my day, I have a reliable map of what I am going to do in a day which helps me not to get too bored or too over-booked/manic.  I am SUPER introverted and I don't like being around people at all, but the amount of "alone time" I think I require a lot more time by myself than many people, making some to-do list goals helps me stay balanced so i don't totally become a hermit.  Some days, I also need to just stay in bed all day and that's OKAY.  It's for health, mental and physical, so when it's necessary just accept that you need to do it, like you'd take an antihistamine for allergies or something.  It's also okay to slow down the pace of rejoing society - no way in hell would I attempt community theater or volunteering with kids or animals, not to denigrate those goals, but maybe just slow down your pace a little and "for today" make rejoining society a 30 minute walk outside to the park or something like that.  I would echo the sentiment already posted about limiting your exposure to contentious online communities, or if you are feeling strong you can use the comment section of the kitten live cam for example, practice the skill of shutting down people who are giving you unsolicited criticism, like say "thank you, I am trying to improve but not looking for further feedback at this time" or something boilerplate like that, just copy/paste, move on, block the person, whatever.  If the forum gets too "hot", limit your exposure to it (such as 90DF forums, etc).  You don't need a lot money to work on skills to rejoin society, start with things like online support groups (I don't really care for AA myself, but there are other groups that have online meetings that are great like SMART recovery which draws a lot from DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy), another really good toolkit of skills.  Maybe if you are interested, you can schedule 15 minutes in a day to look into DBT, attend 1 meeting a week, take walks twice a week, etc.  It gets easier when you can have these routines because it's less blank space to try and figure out what to do with all at once.  Hopefully there is some useful info for you here.
mq0vt5,,guhof7o,Yesterday I ask my case worker if the DBT is starting back up at our agency. It is something I wanted to get into but they stopped it for the pandemic. It seems like my agency that I'm a client of his the only one that didn't really get on board with Telehealth and actually fired some of their therapists despite a sudden influx of clients. My caseworker is good though and she is going to help me look for therapy outside of the agency. And Ceramics group and cooking classes she also mentioned have started back up. I would try those now that I have a car again. Thank you. I also do The To Do List in my own way. I will have a little notepad with a title every morning based on how I feel. Today the title is things I might be able to do today and it gets very specific. Like today I'm going to put "take a shower without washing hair because you wash your hair yesterday so it won't take as long so maybe when you get out and dry off you'll have the energy to get dressed and go get some sunshine but if you don't go anywhere you really ought to change your sheets because you just taking a shower." lol
mq0vt5,gug3i3q,,>And I don't have the money to join real Society to do things like go to clubs and restaurants to meet real people. So I'm just here on the internet and I'm finding that now instead of panic attacks I'm just so sad and so broken.  I think this is the root of the issue.  Now that you have a place to live have you thought about getting a job?  If you aren't able to work then can you get on disability?  Housing is important but it's just the first step.  You need a community and you need something greater to pursue that drives you, something more than just surviving.  >I just don't want to expose myself to those innocent people  I know that feeling, but thinking like that is not helpful to anyone.  Let people decide for themselves if they don't want to be around you.  But being around people you don't like sometimes is part of life for everyone.  Volunteering is a great way to get used to being around people and better at interacting with them.  I've struggled with severe social anxiety my whole life and exposure therapy is the only thing that works for me other than drugs that aren't worth it.  It's like any other skill, the more you do it the easier it gets and the better you'll find you are at it.  Being homeless can really fuck you up mentally and make you feel like you're worthless.  I have been there.  It's a hard thing to get past and it takes time.  Give yourself credit for all of the positive changes you've made, and have faith that if you keep going things will keep getting better.  You're worth it and society needs you.
mq0vt5,,guhnkub,The question of job and disability application is one that we have been discussing with my case management. I want to go to into it but it's been overwhelming for me just like everything else. I am terrified of getting a job again. It's been about five years since I worked. They seem to only be able to place me in jobs below my abilities like cash registers and Warehouse Packers. I have done those things before and the people in those kind of places just very intimidating. I don't like to work in a place where you have to shout. When I have asked my case workers about helping me get placed in a job more suited to my skill level they say they don't usually get employers looking for people at that skill level who work with the program because nobody assumes homeless people are educated and smart. I actually have a college education but not a degree and a significant amount of skilled work experience but I have been terrified to apply for jobs again based on all the stuff that happened to me when I moved to Missouri. Like the time my employer just blew off my disclosure of autism and I decided to just not go back because they weren't going to protect me under the Disabilities Act.
mq0vt5,,gujggof,i see some part-time bookkeeping jobs sometimes on craigslist, usually that's alone work and just numbers, if you're into that, and part-time is great, like 2-3 days/week. you don't need a college degree, just computer experience and paperwork skills.
mq0vt5,gug4dar,,Hi, thank you for sharing with us. Have you thought about joining something like a community garden? Or maybe take some lunch or snacks and go sit at a safe park when the weather is nice? Volunteering always takes the focus off of ourselves. Maybe volunteer at an animal shelter. I think what you may need is a sense of purpose and perhaps some real life interaction. Internet is great, but never a substitute for real soul needing connection. Look in your city website and see if there are any community events, maybe you can volunteer or any church events in your area. You don‚Äôt have to be religious, if it‚Äôs an activity you want to participate. I know now may not be an abundance of things out there, but things are opening up. Are there any seniors in your area that don‚Äôt have anyone, who may need some company or some light errands for them. Caring for others or plants, always makes us feel good and makes us smile inward and outward.  Those are some of my ideas.
mq0vt5,,guhn5h3,I have a travel hammock and have thought about bringing it to the park. It's something I used to do when I needed a nap so it comes with a little anxiety even doing that. The park ranger knows me and doesn't know I'm housed now so I haven't been back to that Park lately. But it's a good idea. I enjoyed hanging my hammock under the Footbridge where nobody could see me even if it looks funny I wasn't doing anything illegal. My apartment complex is full of people who were placed here out of similar situations or disabled older adults. I kind of get annoyed by their behavior actually and haven't been interested in befriending anybody here. I think I have some kind of superiority complex going maybe people when I was homeless people called me a snob. I just really don't want to be associated with any of these neighbors either. Two different neighbors downstairs are drug dealers and the one across from me flirt with me all the time quit smoking just so I wouldn't have to go outside and talk to him.
mq0vt5,gugbl0j,,It sounds to me that now that you‚Äôre in a safe place you are actually able to process your feelings instead of having to be in street survival mode. Finally having space or safety to confront emotions can be so incredibly difficult and overwhelming. Do you journal? If not, you could try it and see if it helps. Sometimes I think just getting the thoughts/feelings out of the body onto paper makes it where I don‚Äôt feel like I have to hold onto it- I can revisit it later if I want to. Also, this is extremely difficult to do, I try to practice it but it‚Äôs against my (and I think all people‚Äôs) nature- do you ever just try to lie down and feel all the pain and anxiety instead of fighting it? Like I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing it without having established with yourself that you are safe and you will come out the other side. Sometimes when I do this I literally hold my own hands and I think to myself ‚ÄúI am safe‚Äù over and over again (and I believe it to be true) and I just let all the bad anxiety and sadness wash through me and I cry and cry and then afterwards I feel, like, wrung out, and exhausted, but lighter. Anyway basically what I‚Äôm saying is maybe now is not the time for you to force yourself ‚Äúinto society‚Äù but maybe it‚Äôs the time to have patience with yourself, feel your feelings and balance all the shit with an honest to god self love and self safety campaign. I‚Äôm not a therapist but I care how you‚Äôre doing and I hope you are able to find joy, however small, in each day. Take care of yourself.
mq0vt5,,guhl2cp,I think that's where I was yesterday. I woke up sobbing from dreams and made these posts and just continued crying all day even from unrelated topics. I took a shower and made the space to visit with my caseworker yesterday to which house and she's going to meet me again this week. But then I went back to crying all day because well because I can right now. Me and my eyes hurt today but I feel a little better
mq0vt5,,gui1a27,I‚Äôm glad you just let yourself cry. Sometimes that‚Äôs all we can do and that‚Äôs just what‚Äôs needed! It can feel so scary to have to cry so much! Anyway I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre feeling a little better, that is so great, even if it‚Äôs only a little bit!
mq0vt5,gugrrvx,,It is the beginning, and every day is a choice to get up put one foot in front of the other. Put constructive choices in place of  negative ones. Most importantly positive thoughts in place of the negative ones that want to take over. I have had my negative coping mechanisms cause problems with my development for many years. I stay positive and keep moving and when those thoughts...what if this-I will break what if that-can I handle it. I push that shit out and tell myself I will find a way through. When the despair tries to wrap itself around me I push it away and I believe it's all good because I breath and I know I am happy to be alive. I forgive myself for fucking up and remind myself that I choose to care for myself. Have you heard of the breathing guy Wim Hof. Learn to breath to access autonomic system. Yogi shit. Your traumas will break you or build you, your choice. Just know that there are thoughts out there from these lovely people wishing you well.
mq0vt5,gudnwco,,r/roomandboard   Read the megathread you might find it helpful   Try working "back of the house" like slinging dishes or whatever, you can stay lowkey
mq0vt5,,guds9pm,I'm confused but looks like a thread for people who need a place to stay. I'm not looking for that and I'm not sure what you meant by the second sentence
mq0vt5,,gujgp4s,"back of the house" in restaurants means in the kitchen instead of "front of the house" which is where the wait staff work, so kitchen helper / dish washer
mq0vt5,gudoj51,,Hey OP, that sucks that the isolation is getting to you like this - humans are social animals and I totally get why this is hurting you so badly, especially with the dichotomy of being housed and things are better but feeling alone verses being unhoused and things overall suck but having some people contact.   Covid shit is ending, if you can hang on for a couple more months a lot of things will open back up again and give you opportunities for real life socializing. Until then, I have a suggestion. Have you considered looking to see if a local animal shelter has volunteer openings? You mentioned cats being your world in another comment and so if you could find a way to volunteer with them, it might help you get out and be around people in a way that's a little more controllable and on your terms than a random job and cheaper than any purely fun things like clubs. My general go-to when I want to socialize but am too broke to do fun stuff and too incapable of a long-term job is either volunteering somewhere or taking a weekend job at an event, so I figured I'd offer that tip to you and maybe it'll help.
mq0vt5,,gudsjfv,Thank you. It wasn't recent but I have tried to volunteer at a shelter in the past and I was overcome with sadness for all the animals who could not get adopted and the cramped conditions at the shelter. I thought about it off and on and I wish I could just Foster kittens or something in my home like the videos I watched. But I'm not allowed more than one cat. I'm just terrified that the sadness of an animal shelter would overcome me again and with the way that I have been feeling lately I just feel like I'm going to burst into tears all over again for no reason thinking about all the dead kittens I can't save
mq0vt5,,guen1hn,Can you volunteer to dog walk in your local area? I'm sure there's loads of people struggling to be able to walk their dogs (sick or older people or busy working couples who might even pay you)
mq0vt5,guebukk,,The problem with talking online  is people can troll hard.   They see your weakness and make themselves feel better.  Just remind yourself that you can be distracted, try a backup hobby.  Maybe a schedule, routine and diary. Sometimes, even if you just say..I'm going to have tuna on Wed, a burger on thurs. And a nice salad with chicken on Friday.  You can think about real quick to fool your mind from anxious thoughts.   I do.    Did I tell I am gonna have a tuna sandwich tomorrow.  A burger on Thursday, and a salad with chicken on Friday.  Ful your restless mind with a few different items to distract you from your anxiety.   I will do the meal thing, try some crosswords, maybe reading or tv.   You can do IT!   And you can't...I'm having a tuna.  Definitely onion crunch, maybe some celery so it's more crunchy than onion.   Some mayo. And diced tomato ...  on toast. I can almost smell it.
mq0vt5,guedm9a,,Housing First is just that.  Then take the next step.  We all have anxiety. Learning to do things in spite of it is tough.  Have you tried volunteering?  Sometimes this can be a great next step to get out and do things.   I totally agree with then comment about only being in positive subreddits. I find the negative ones will quickly ruin my day.
mq0vt5,guemyzi,,You may feel so and that is valid, but you aren‚Äôt unfit to join society. We all have our curtains closed, so to speak, but if you ever got a look behind the curtain you‚Äôd realize we‚Äôre all a mess in some aspect. Your feelings are valid but the number one way to become whatever it is you seek to be is to be around people like that, modeled behavior is a powerful tool. Right now due to the pandemic, doing this is tough, but maybe you could be making goals for groups you could join once it‚Äôs safe to do so?
mq0vt5,gufd3bz,,I'm so sorry you are feeling this way. Your honest and deep understanding of your situation is incredible. I feel like you are really close to a break through.   There's a lot of really good advice here. I hope you give some of it a try.   Exercise and meditation videos on youtube are good.   Take care.
mq0vt5,gufntyn,,You've said multiple times that you feel like you have nothing. That is not true. You've overcome addiction, gotten housing, are caring for a living creature other than yourself, and have healed a lot from terrible anxiety and PTSD (we never fully heal from these things, but you not having any panic attacks? Incredible achievement). Trust me, most people would have soooo much trouble dealing with any ONE of these things. You've done it all. It's amazing. Don't ever forget how far you've come and all the courage you have.
mq0vt5,gugm0kn,,I can relate. Take away our stress and fear, and we're left with our sadness, emptiness, and misery.   You might try paxil for the social anxiety.  It's also an anti-depressant.  It didn't work for me, but it works for others.  The autism diagnosis might qualify you for SSDI.  A little more cash could help you feel normal..?  Ignore the online insults.  Hang in there!
mq0vt5,,guhm3j9,I am an ultra-rapid metabolizer of Paxil and Other Drugs. I have been very hesitant to take the new ones that came back okay on my metabolism test. I am so hesitant to take medications again oh, I won't get into that. We are working on an SSDI application but as usual it's overwhelming me as well as every other part of life. I have had a very chaotic life and finding my medical history even remembering where I was at a certain time when I got Medical Care is very difficult for me for the application.
mq0vt5,gufq8yj,,Well I hope you realize you really are in a good place.  Maybe your not happy at the moment. But in the long term your safe. You have a home and a car and your not living in a bunk bed  tent with angry drunk smelly homeless people. The feelings you have are momentary. I'm sorry your going through an unhappy time in your life. I hope you feel better.
mq0vt5,gudnojz,,Hey friend. Since you have Internet, Google "autism in women/girls". You sound like you have some of the traits. It may be worth asking your therapist for an assessment centered on diagnosis in women, because the traits of autism present differently in women. Autistic women are also much higher risk of becoming victims of abusive and toxic relationships.  Might help you get the appropriate resources to help you with the overload.
mq0vt5,,gudobuo,Oh I do have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. However I don't know how it is factoring into my treatment plan because I am not able to meet with my therapist until the end of March this month. I just met with my caseworker this morning and we discussed all the things I want to go over with my therapist and maybe this is relevant. I don't know what treatments there are available for autism though. It seems like something I'm just doomed with. My social skills are just fine when I am in a group of people who are not being mean. But when I start to get overwhelmed with mean people and try to use the coping skills for self-soothing that I do know or asking somebody I trust for help, the mean people will make fun of me and actually send me further into overwhelmed beyond the capacity of my coping skills. Is making me very terrified to re-enter Society after my experience of being autistic in a homeless shelter. For example when I was having a meltdown after a meth head yelled at me I went to the bathroom to be by myself and the woman followed me and continued yelling at me. I asked her and very respectful way to please allow me some time away from the situation so I could calm down and come back and relate in a more respectful Manner and she told me I was actually being disrespectful to her by running away and she hit me in the head with a bathroom stall door. When I told the shelter volunteer I was still crying and hyperventilating in the shelter volunteer told me I had been doing meth in the bathroom with the woman who was attacking me.
mq0vt5,,gueg1im,Both the shelter volunteer and meth head were wrong. I'm especially angry at the volunteer on your behalf. What a thing to assume. She wasn't there to be sure.  Just a lurking supporter but my heart hurts for all you've been through. You deserve so much care
mq0vt5,,gufznmo,It's 100% relevant, because you can get more services and reasonable accomodations in the workplace with a recognized, documented disability. It's not about "treatment" of autism. It's about making sure you have EXTRA HELP in getting adapted to living in a structure.   You absolutely don't have to go back to being homeless, or being around crazy drug addicts who are ACTIVE users. The only thing you need to worry about is not using drugs, or shopping, or eating excess food, or doing anything that is self-harmful as a coping mechanism. Only do stuff that helps you stim and redirect your energies into stuff that's POSITIVE that you can CONTROL.   So, you could use your time in your apartment to watch fitness videos, and if you start feeling anxious, do pushups, or squats, or jumping jacks. Something that will have an IMMEDIATE affect, in 2-3 minutes to redirect that anxiety and physical stress into a POSITIVE.   You CAN do this. You are not alone. feel free to come over to /r/AutisticAdults or /r/aspergirls or /r/neurodiverse or /r/neurodiversity if you need more support.
mq0vt5,,guhkgzu,Interesting. kind of put the autism on the back burner. Right before I had the car accident and the drug problem, I had lost a job. Actually I quit out of anxiety. I had decided to disclose my diagnosis to my employer so that I could start asking for some accommodations like being placed in an office where I could hear myself talk instead of thermal label printer is whining all day. My employer told me she had a grandson with autism, she knew how to handle it, I would be fine, and not to make the disclosure to HR. I was really shocked. I knew I couldn't keep working there without some kind of accommodation and protection under Ada. The reason I had told my boss before I told the HR department is that the HR department was very intimidating to me. I had often heard that HR lady talking about me behind my back in the bathroom in a bad way. I didn't want her to know about my disability but she would have been the person I would have to tell officially. I figured because of how my boss behaved the HR lady would be similarly dismissive. This was a Podunk little Factory in the middle of nowhere that didn't necessarily follow a lot of federal regulations. But since my boss just so flippantly dismissed it and discourage me I was so shocked that I just stopped going back to work. I didn't know what to do. My boss was even pounding on my door at home and stuff. I became so overwhelmed figuring nobody would help me they would just dismiss me. That's when things started doing really South in my life for a few years back and I moved in with an abusive person instead of looking for another job
mq0vt5,gug4mn4,,What state are you in?
mq0vt5,,guhmubf,Mo. Why do you ask? I'm pretty familiar with a lot of the things available to me in my local area and have a good relationship with one church that does a lot of homeless Outreach already. In fact I have thought about volunteering with them but I don't think I'm quite ready for that socially yet because they do street level Outreach and I'm trying to avoid my ex-boyfriend as well. He knows where I live and he still goes to that church

mn4wiw,,gtw5z5w,Is there a better hospital nearby? Idk where you are but if you're in the US, any hospital that accepts medicaid is required to treat you in the ER or in L&D if you're in labor, regardless of whether you have insurance or any other form of payment

mn4wiw,gtwncb2,,You mention that you‚Äôre in California, I‚Äôm in California too, I‚Äôm in San Jose, where are you? You can feel free to message me if you want. I‚Äôm a female and spent 5 years on the streets up until last year.   I hate saying this and I will likely get downvoted but I would suggest either getting an abortion or using the fact that you are pregnant to get yourself into a program and off the streets.   You keep saying you are desperate but then you say you won‚Äôt go to the county hospital because ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad.‚Äù If you are truly desperate you would use whatever resources are available to you.   Disability usually takes a couple of years to get approved, and that‚Äôs **if** you have a lot of history/documentation from doctors etc. In the meantime though you should be qualified for GA. Previously you said your aunt lived 30 minutes away, if you have a vehicle now why can you not go to stay with her?
mn4wiw,,gtwrflv,I‚Äôm scared to get an abortion. I‚Äôm not in a place that has them, and I don‚Äôt have the money for one currently.   And Ive been to county m before after my mom died, and I told them what was happening but the most they could do was tell me to get ebt and therapy.   Should I give up on keeping hope for disability then? /not sarcasm genuinely asking./ I have alot of history and hospital visits and doctor stuff, but if even that will take years is it best to give up on that?   As with my aunt, she didnt need me for work anymore. She doesn‚Äôt have room in her house for me and when I asked her about just sleeping in my car outside her home for a place to be safe she got upset at me about how ‚Äòbad‚Äô that would make her look to have a homeless person on her property.
mn4wiw,,gtwuv7m,Personally I think giving birth is *way* scarier than having an abortion. The bottom line is one of those two things is going to happen, pretty soon you‚Äôre not going to be able to choose which one.   In California abortions can be done for any reason and the full cost is covered by Medi-Cal so it doesn‚Äôt cost you anything.   I‚Äôm not saying to give up on getting disability, you should definitely still pursue that if you feel you can‚Äôt work, just know that it may take some time. I also recommend getting a lawyer to help you with your disability case. The lawyer doesn‚Äôt cost you anything, their fee comes out of your back pay when your claim is approved.
mn4wiw,,gtwvh3t,I‚Äôll give the abortion thing some thought, i didnt know medi-cal paid for that stuff. Idk where they do it but I know Its not in town. Ill have to look around. Do other places besides planned parenthood do them?  I can call around in the morning and see if I can find a good lawyer, but I‚Äôve never done that before either. Is there anything I need to look out for when searching?
mn4wiw,,gtx0lv2,Just look for a lawyer that specifically says ‚Äúdisability lawyer‚Äù there are strict rules they have to follow such as only being able to take a certain percentage of your back pay for the fee.   Yes, places other than planned parenthood do abortions. I would search online for abortion and your county or city. You could also contact your county health department. Good luck!
mn4wiw,gtwat99,,Please don't give up. There is always a light on the other side, you just have to hold on. We are here for you and I want you to know that the world is better with you in it. I said a prayer for you, I hope Jesus finds you where you are. I hope you will seriously think about asking him for help in your situation. It might not be right away, but He provides us with what we need as we need it. And know that nothing you have done makes you unworthy of that. He is closest to sinners no matter what we have done, since we are the ones who need him the most. And he is even closer to the broken hearted. I know you can get through this, let him help you.

mkzvcu,,gtj2tk4,I appreciate that. Thank you so much.
mkzvcu,,gtkah0x,of course you deserve it brother ,nobody deserves to be homeless , congrats on not being homeless any longer ,and your supervisor sounds a compassionate and understanding person what a top bloke  . best wishes

mkzvcu,gtjjxfg,,What a good man I have my best friend we met when I first became homeless he didn't know I would say 3 or 4 months later I told him my situation not much was said about it beyond that and I promise I wasnt looking for hand outs and he wasn't giving them we just continued being friends and hanging out I watched him grow like a fuck champion I've never seen some grow so fast in his job he started where I was untill where he is now (our boss's boss job at the time aka the district manager) I mean God damn I would have never guessed it's been a little over a year now and he help he didn't give me hand outs but he helped me get out of homelessness I needed to get out of my car I was financing he bought a brand new car offered to sell it to me I jumped at it a few months later (about a month ago) I was looking for places to live and I was applying to everywhere I could but no takes because if credit/no rent history he finally said come switch apartments with me because he had the option and as of Thursday I have been in my new home it's been a year since I became homeless from my medical status he helped me so much he made me want to keep going it was amazing that out of nowhere at the hardest part of my life me appeared and has been with me since I've never had a better friend I hope one day I can repay him I'm still kind of puzzled with why out of everyone in the world that fucking wonderful human decided he wanted to be my friend I'm so happy to be in my new house it's almost been a week and I still can't thank him enough I wish I could come out and tell him without me crying how much I love him (we are just friends please understand this) because if I could I would

mku8ri,gti55k1,,My parents kicked me out when I was 18. I was strung out on meth, had dropped outta high school, and was in and out of juvy.  About a month after they kicked my out I was penniless and homeless in corona california, somewhere I had never been before. Tried to kill myself, ended up in a hospital, hit rock bottom. Changed. My. Life. That was almost 30 years ago and I still remember sleeping on park benches like it was yesterday, covering myself with newspapers to stay warm, shoplifting from the grocery store, taking a shit in the bushes in the park. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. And I would never do that to my kids.
mku8ri,,gti9pac,I'm having a hard time picking myself up. Each year gets worse. Suicide seems like my best option.
mku8ri,,gtie70b,Yo I don't know anything about your situation but if you have a drug problem, goto detox, then rehab, then work a 12 step program. People will say this and that about a 12 step program but it just works for most everyone.If you're just homeless because of circumstances, get fabulously drunk and check yourself into rehab, tell them you have a drinking problem, they'll help you out too.  There's a ton of help out there, you just need to know where to look, and people in rehab centers will help you find it.  \* Edit: I'm not joking about the rehab thing. I live in a sober living house, we've had people come in off the street before wihtout a dollar in their pocket and finding funding for a month's rent is easy. Checkout [Oxford House vacancies](https://www.oxfordvacancies.com/) to see if there's a house near you.
mku8ri,,gtirit7,Wow, I didn't know that thought you had to be an addict.  I'm homeless and MDD. I will check it out.
mku8ri,,gtiti1j,The way it is right now with the opiod epidemic, all the money and support is easiest to find via drug rehab. I'm not saying you should lie, but if you do say you have a problem with alcohol (and especially a dual diagnosis ie. MDD and alcoholism) then the support is easier to find.
mku8ri,,gtiv7dj,I appreciate the advice. Did you use Oxford House?
mku8ri,,gtix1q6,Yeah I currently live in an oxford house, I relapsed about 15 years ago, did the rehab thing and moved in here about 2 1/2 years. My best friends live in this house, I love the guys here.
mku8ri,,gtiymma,It sounds you have a good support system there
mku8ri,,gtj3z3o,I am very fortunate. It's hard to believe where I was a couple years ago, I was being evicted, lost custody of my kids, fired from my job, ran outta money, drivers license suspended. I used to sit around on my couch all levels of fucked up with a loaded gun waiting for someone to break into my home and trying to come upw tih the coiurage to pull the trigger on myself. I'm on anti-depression and anti-anxiety meds now, they really help. I seldom get thoughts of self harm anymore and when I do, I have a counselor and roommates to talk to. I have some hobbies too, something I never really had when I was using / drinking.   Anyways there's hope, and I sincerely wish you the best.
mku8ri,,gtnlkw6,Sounds you are doing well.
mku8ri,,gtjm5r5,I understand what you're saying, but don't oxford houses get away with violating(?) some local occupancy/zoning/etc regulations *because* they are able to claim residents are in recovery (medical exemption).  I completely agree with oxford houses for those who are trying to stop using, but I worry when they get suggested as a place for anyone.
mku8ri,gti9zw7,,Mine turned her back on me when I had a mental breakdown. My mental illness stems from a traumatic childhood filled with physical, emotionally and sexual abuse. She also convinced my weak ass sibling to turn on me.
mku8ri,gtikgnb,,Wow, a lot of people in the comments were kicked out as teenagers (including me lol). I think you may have found one of the biggest links to homelessness.
mku8ri,gti3a6g,, my  mum kicked me out at 17 ,i had to sleep in a park , then she wonders  why i ended up on heroin for ten years and been to jail 12 times ,  really did me good thanks mum  last  time i was in court the judge told me my life was tragic and then gave  me a two year prison sentance , jee thanks your honour for your wisdom,  that will help me with my "tragic" life ...cunt  some people are shit aint they  pay attention parents that are considering kicking a child out onto the streets ,it does them no favours
mku8ri,gtih00a,,You retired at 31? That's impressive.
mku8ri,,gtikjs3,Right? That's the main thing that stuck out to me.
mku8ri,,gtltztb,Probably "retired " by collecting SSI and a section 8 voucher at 31 years old.   I have known people who have done that at a young age.
mku8ri,gtiv5ai,,This was always an odd thing to me and seems cultural(I'm Hispanic). My aunt lived with my grandma until she was around 30 and my uncles lived with her until their mid 20s. They had jobs and helped with bills it was more of a "I'm ready to start a family" when they moved out. I lived with my parents until my early 20s I was just ready for my own space.  &#x200B;  My white friends would tell me "Yeah I got to move out when I'm 18" and I was like what? I thought that was some TV trope shit. I guess there is truth to them.
mku8ri,gthtyzl,,15 my mom put me up for adoption. About the same age my dad disappeared from 8-10 years. I would‚Äôve loved to just get kicked out at 18.
mku8ri,,gti6tdp,Put you up for adoption at *15?!* Holy shit, that's evil. I'm so sorry. How is that even legal?
mku8ri,,gti9fdl,My mom told her therapist she didn‚Äôt feel strong enough to look after me anymore and the therapist got a social worker from child services involved, after a few months they couldn‚Äôt find a foster family for me and I was sent across to country to live with grandparents
mku8ri,,gti9pkb,Wow.
mku8ri,,gtia4af,Still reeling from it to this day. My family wants me to be better connected with her because I‚Äôm shattering her heart by having her blocked on everything. But all she‚Äôs ever done is hurt me and refuse to help me in my times of need.
mku8ri,,gtiaau8,How can they not understand that she completely broke your trust? I would block her too, that is unforgivable. At the time, when you were 15, did she try to explain it to you or apologize?
mku8ri,,gtiangv,My family really believes you never separate just because you had a disagreement. Months later, and for a couple years after she begged me to move in with her on and off. I‚Äôm 26 now and honestly life has just never gotten easier. I reconnected with my dad at 23 and last summer he threatened to murder me by slitting my throat. I called the police a while after to report it but they didn‚Äôt do anything.
mku8ri,,gtias3y,Fuck, that sounds like a severely toxic family. I hope things get better.
mku8ri,,gtiavpi,Me too üòê
mku8ri,,gtiz15t,We can't choose the sperm, egg and womb we grow in, and just because we formed from two people yeehawing in bed does not obligate us to keep them around in any way, shape or form. You are so much better without them, no matter how fucked life is right now. You are 100% stronger and freer without them and their toxic bullshit.  You don't need em. At all. I hope your future is absolutely amazing for you in every way because you absolutely deserve a great life with no more worries than everyone else has (no such thing as a life with zero worries after all BUT you  have had more than enough bullshit in your past and that's WAY too many worries, so I'm realistically wishing you the kind of life with the kind of worries that are normal. "Fuck, where did I leave my keys?" "Ugh, I forgot to call Jane....", "Ran out of laundry soap..." shit like that. No more worries than every one else has).  Hugs to you. Strong hugs.
mku8ri,,gtjbi92,From your earlier reply it sounds like she never intended to give you up, is that true? I'd be livid if all it took were those words spoken to my therapist to get my kid taken away by social services. I'm sorry you had to go through all that pain so early in life
mku8ri,,gtjfato,No she very much believed in it and supported it all those months the social worker was coming by. I just think she had regret after.
mku8ri,,gtjhyt2,Oh man that seems just as shitty since I imagine her now acting like she never did anything wrong in the first place, that's manipulation 101 lol
mku8ri,,gtji17p,She‚Äôs never even once admitted it ever occurred
mku8ri,gti0ay7,,I graduated high school at 17, I turned 18 later that summer. My mother came to me after I graduated and said ‚Äúyou need to be out by August 1st, we have a foreign exchange student coming and she‚Äôs going to be staying in your room.‚Äù I‚Äôd already been paying rent to her for a year, but she was going to get more money through the exchange program. My parents ended up kicking her out and sending her to a different house a few months into the gig for the same teenage shit that I did; smoking cigs, drinking, that kind of thing. One of the many reasons I ended up going no-contact with them.
mku8ri,,gtizib4,Jesus fucking christ. Parents that do that to their own fucking blood never deserved to have kids.  My son lived with me til age 24 when he was financially able to buy a home and have minimum 6 months saved up for JUST potential future bills and mortgage. Fuck a "parent" that yeets their blood out of the house at 18. I've read horror stories of kids whose parents have said, "oh in 2 weeks you graduate and you're out of the house that weekend after."  Like, who can get an apt in 3 fucking weeks or less?!?!  Scumshits don't deserve to be parents.
mku8ri,,gtrlzdg,Are you in the US? If so I‚Äôm calling BS on your story. We‚Äôve had 6 foreign exchange students and they don‚Äôt pay you for it. You pay for all their food, housing, etc.
mku8ri,,gtshnkf,This was 20 years ago, so things may have been different? I actually overheard my parents talking about the monthly stipend. In either case, they kicked me out for a stranger, so call bs all you want.
mku8ri,gtim0hz,,How is he doing now?   Not sure it‚Äôs recent but you‚Äôre a saint for doing this.  Hope all goes well for the both of you
mku8ri,,gtinbz9,Happened last week. I have already rented an apartment for him and paid 6 months rent to the landlord in advance, and found him a job above minimum wage. Will be checking in on him every month or so.  No way am I going to stand by without intervening as I experienced this first hand all that time ago. I was a resident of the shelter I picked him up from at some point!
mku8ri,,gtitgbs,Dude you‚Äôre a saint   Holy shit. So happy you got him  Have you talked with his parents at all?
mku8ri,,gtiw8om,I have not had a chance to speak to his father yet. I have to approach the situation carefully as my relationship with his dad has been strictly professional up to this point.  I'm hoping to be able to show his dad how well he is doing in a couple of months with his new job, place, etc. And that might resolve the situation without any hard feelings.
mku8ri,,gtiwdt7,That might, yeah  I hope his father changes his ways. I get his son an adult but he‚Äôs barely an adult.. You again are a saint
mku8ri,,gtizqbf,I Commend you.  You are THE epitome of what Being Human means.
mku8ri,gtiphqs,,Wow...thank you for stepping in and saving this poor soul.  Is he still staying with you?
mku8ri,gticgi3,,100% agree
mku8ri,gtj5hjx,,I feel had for anyone that gets kicked out at such a young age by their parents. I was so naive at that age  ...i probably would have either been dead or in prison.
mku8ri,gtiphnp,,Congratulations on retirement. Throwing them out at 18 is too young.
mku8ri,gtivfhp,,I think when I was around 15 years my mom was trying to sent me to a homeless shelter because I communicate with her. I tried to but every time I had, she did was invalidate how I felt. When my grandmother stopped her, we had a short conversation. Then a few years later she proceeds to kick me out twice. First time I had left a week early and wrote a note, I attempted to walk to my auntie's house. My mom would give me a deadline both times and she also told my family that I had ran away. I tried to convince my brothers that I didn't because I was an adult. I stayed with my grandmother and auntie for four months and moved back with my mom. Second time I spent a night outside and let in to same homeless shelter that my mom was going to put me in. I stayed there for a month and to be honest, that place doesn't really help people. Then my favoritism babyacting godmother and dumb godfather took out of there and I spent two months in North Carolina then moved back to my mom's. The only reason why I kept moving back in with my mom because I was giving her chances to change. But I realized that three years ago, my mom will be the same emotionally available parent for the rest of my life. I plan on moving soon and cutting her out of my life completely. If I have adopted children, then I will never treat them like how my mom treated me.
mku8ri,gtihq4a,,i can concur. Le streets dont play.    Here today gone tommorow.
mku8ri,gtjall0,,That‚Äôs hard, your intervention is probably a lifesaver for that kid. I had to move out of an inhospitable family home when I was 15 (and a half). I did ok but it was hard and precarious.  How is he doing now?
mku8ri,gu2cf3h,,My dad wanted to kick me out at 17. My mom and him fought constantly over it and came to the compromise that he could kick me out at 18 if I couldn't start paying them rent. He then refused to give me rides to interviews when I applied places, sabotaging me so I couldn't get a job. I knew 18 was the deadline so I did odd jobs and a paper route etc saved up enough to make it to a friends house with help from my brother  after turning 18, where I saved up a little more, then they kicked me out for being lgbt, managed to sort of make it on my own after that. My parents tried to reconcile and I tried to give them a second chance until I came out to them and then they cut me off again. So that's that, I guess.
mku8ri,ig966e5,,But I thought you were atheist
mkqjz7,gti2jm8,,One of the most sorely needed jobs in this country is caregiving.  You have experience taking care of your mom.  Find a social worker through the county, get yourself cleaned up, get on the medications you need for your mental health and find a way to build a life being a caregiver.
mkqjz7,,gti3els,I took a course on caregiveruni and got a caregiver certification and tried using that and my background to apply for ones but so far nothing. I made my resume look nice along with a cover letter, still a dead end.
mkqjz7,,gti49vz,In my line of work, I see firsthand how desperately this kind of work is needed.  You could be live-in and offer less pay, that way you would get experience and a place to stay.  One of the biggest issues I see with caregiving for elderly, dying or chronically ill folks is affording caregiver hours.  But you need a place to stay, safety, food, and some regular income more than a high salary; so it would be perfect for you especially since you are pregnant.  I recommend putting up posts:  on Facebook, on Nextdoor, on craigslist, everywhere.  Try to find work outside of the regular agencies.  Do not post anything dramatic, focus on your strengths, your experience and what you did well, and how you‚Äôre getting started so you are affordable.  But you need to be stable and calm.  You need to be responsible.  That‚Äôs hard to do when you have not fully addressed your mental health issues.  That‚Äôs why I suggest getting a social worker, focusing on this plan, and having SW help you sort out your own health first.  Sometimes, you have to just keep trying, but it‚Äôs easier if you have a focus.
mkqjz7,,gti4snw,Thank you, I‚Äôll try and see what I can do. I have EBT, and I think they give me a case worker but I‚Äôm not entirely sure if thats the same type of SW.   Maybe my issue was going through agencies instead of solo. I can try and see if that gets me better luck.   I‚Äôm also not sure how rates go, but I could easily take $5 an hour just to get by.
mkqjz7,,gti5g8l,$5 an hour plus live-in!  What‚Äôs really needed is for caregivers to stay in the home, but you need to be trustworthy, and you need to be stable.  I don‚Äôt know what happened with your grandparents, but if they or anyone else can vouch for the fact that you cared for your mom and managed to keep your mom safe, it would go a long way during the vetting process, especially since you are bipolar.   You need to be stabilized on medications first.
mkqjz7,,gti5s4i,My brothers, and 2 sister-in-laws could vouch for me if needed.  For the medicine, I was on an antidepressant for severe depression but it had to be paired with a mood stabilizer because the AD made me manic by itself. I‚Äôm also afraid of how safe it is for my baby if I were to restart.
mkqjz7,,gtika3x,Contact your siblings for help!!!!
mkqjz7,,gtikfes,One is in the same type of situation, one is in another state, and the other can‚Äôt help me more than emotional support:(
mkqjz7,,gtil1n6,Can the out of state one help? Also you 100% need to see a doctor about your pregnancy and bipolar disorder. The meds can be dangerous for the baby but so can the unmedicated mental illness. This isn‚Äôt something you can figure out on your own, you need a professional.
mkqjz7,,gtilm9h,I can try and ask again if he can help.  And I know, I called community psych but they can‚Äôt take me in for another two months because of Covids mental toll. My primaries mental health team doesn‚Äôt take my Medi-Cal, and I couldn‚Äôt afford my TeleHealthcare anymore.
mkqjz7,gth8pm3,,Oh, also, Google ‚Äúdomestic violence shelter near me‚Äù.  You might qualify for those.    Just tell them that the friend was your boyfriend (I mean, even if you didn‚Äôt label it like that, you guys did have sex. You had an intimate type relationship. Having that type of relationship counts as domestic violence. Also in some states, a house made or a roommate assaulting you counts as domestic violence.  Since domestic simply means ‚Äúhome‚Äù).  And that he abused you, and stole all your money.   You‚Äôre female and pregnant, and the victim of domestic violence.  You should qualify for those domestic violence shelters.
mkqjz7,gthuyw1,,Most chicken plants are hiring always. I know pilgrims hires even if they're full to bursting. Its not pretty work but 13.60 an hour is decent money
mkqjz7,gti2x4y,,Ah this is breaking my heart. Please don‚Äôt expose yourself to the guys that prey on girls in your situation. I know that it‚Äôs hard but seek out the help from trusted organizations first. You can get emergency food from pantries. You said that you have a car, is it possible to sell it and use that money to move yourself into a long-stay airbnb for a month while you figure things out? Usually there are deals on long stays and booking also has deals on weekly hotels and such. Check the listings in your city and sort by lowest price. Sign up for the mobile apps for fast food places too because often they have deals and free food. If there is a CVS near you, sign up for their app. I can DM you a small gift card so that you can get some Pre-natal vitamins and toiletries. Please take care üçÄ
mkqjz7,,gti3r6h,I‚Äôm not sure how much I could get for my car, the hotels here cost $100 a night so it wouldn‚Äôt be long before id be in the same situation but worse. Luckily I got food stamps before I got kicked out so I stock up on canned foods and like poptarts.   And id appreciate the gift card so much. Ive been super scared of not being able to do this baby right, because I can‚Äôt afford prenatal vitamins or care. I want whats best for them, I want them to have a better life and a better chance than I have had and I feel like I am already failing them.
mkqjz7,,gti4lh0,Just sign up for the free CVS rewards card program. I just got the gift card. I‚Äôll DM you the numbers. You have to save it because it‚Äôs a virtual gift card and can only be used in store. But they usually have coupons in the app for healthcare items and sometimes food.
mkqjz7,gth8vlr,,If you‚Äôre in the USA:  I think you can go down to the local Medicaid and citizen service office, and they would have more ideas for resources.  (Or call them).   I think they would know more domestic violence recovery resources.  And they might know programs like WIC (women infants children)‚Äîit‚Äôs like food stamps but with extra.  You get extra money for having children (I think pregnancy counts)
mkqjz7,gth8jh6,,Do you have a Go Fund Me?   Also, I found many really viable and low start up (sometimes free startup) business ideas on Tiktok.   This is going to sound really weird, but it‚Äôs true.  I‚Äôve had a lot of success finding easy ‚Äúside hustles‚Äù on Tiktok.  There‚Äôs some brilliant ideas out there.  Like survey websites that actually work, typing gigs, and more.   Google ‚Äúside hustle Tiktok video‚Äù or ‚Äúeasy ways to make money Tiktok video‚Äù ‚Äúmake money at home Tiktok video‚Äù or ‚Äúmake money online Tiktok video‚Äù   I‚Äôm not doing them now because I‚Äôm in school.  But there was a period where (because I was interested in side hustled) they were all over my Tiktok feed.  And I thought, ‚ÄúWow, some of these are really brilliant and might actually work.‚Äù  I‚Äôd download the tiktok app and search in the app for videos like that AND I‚Äôd also Google some videos and search that way.    Because the Tiktok search algorithm is really stupid and often doesn‚Äôt show good results.  But occasionally it has good results.   Bonus, that the videos are 1 minute long (or shorter).  So you can get like 60 ideas in 60 minutes.  Instead of long YouTube videos where videos are 10-60 minutes long, and you might watch a 45 minute long video and find out it‚Äôs useless and then you wasted a large chunk of time.
ml4goe,gtjgmd3,,Stop and strike up a conversation with them. There's no better place to get the information you seek than from those who are there.
ml4goe,gtlnd9j,,I agree, go talk to them. Don‚Äôt be judgmental, don‚Äôt act like they are some fascinating other species. Just be lowkey, bring some cigarettes to give out, and just talk to them. No reason to be nervous, they‚Äôre just people.
ml4goe,,gtmensx,Cigarettes?  Is that common amongst homeless people?  I do talk to homeless when I used to go to work.  You realize they‚Äôre really not all that different from you.  Frankly, with a couple things panning out different, it could be me homeless.    And, I could think of worse things to be frank.
ml4goe,,gtmwoyv,Yes, cigarette smoking is fairly common among homeless people, it seems like it is at least more common than in the general population. There are a lot of homeless people that can‚Äôt afford the expense of a pack but will happily take one when offered. Even to those that don‚Äôt smoke, offering a cigarette is a universal ‚ÄúI come in peace‚Äù sort of gesture. I think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a luxury item rather than a necessity, there‚Äôs plenty of outreach people that bring us socks and bottled water, no one comes handing out cigarettes. For those that want them, being offered one is a godsend.   Yeah, at times it‚Äôs not all that bad. It sounds like the people you saw have a nice little spot. Homeless camps are very much a community. We look out for each other, watch each other‚Äôs dogs, share resources, and work together. Now that I‚Äôm indoors I actually miss that aspect. I still go out and see my friends and I have a lot of friends who are housed, but it‚Äôs just not quite the same.
ml4goe,,gtn7ebg,Nice.  I live with an addict.  So while my home looks ‚Äònice‚Äô I often don‚Äôt get a lot of peace.  Some mornings I think that the homeless people probably had a more peaceful night than I did, what with my partner being drunk and throwing things at me and generally doing everything to disturb the peace.

ml3nau,,gtjen2n,I think it's pretty much a tie.  I think the weather is pretty similar, all relatively close to water, a high likelihood that you won't have to see snow, seems like there's plenty of resources at any of those three places.

mirznh,,gt74f5r,I agree with your general advice for folks to be careful with game meat, however that case was much more likely to have been sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.   http://outbreaknewstoday.com/prion-expert-link-consumption-squirrel-brain-human-prion-disease-unjustifiably-speculative-42567/  > ‚ÄúThis diagnosis was based on MRI results that reportedly appeared similar to those of patients with variant CJD (vCJD). However, all other clinical and demographic evidence (triphasic EEG pattern, patient age, disease duration, and, subsequently, prion protein codon 129 genotype) strongly suggested that this was a case of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). Indeed, through national human prion disease surveillance, the patient was confirmed through autopsy as sCJD, not vCJD. The reporting of this case as probable vCJD ‚Äî a disease linked to consumption of beef contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as ‚Äúmad cow disease‚Äù) ‚Äî and suggesting that this case might be etiologically linked to squirrel consumption is inappropriate and may cause undue alarm.‚Äù
mirznh,,gt79ac1,Point and counterpoint:  ‚ÄúTME is readily transmissible to raccoons by parenteral, intracerebral and oral routes, and can intracerebrally be transmitted to striped skunks, ferrets, American sable (pine martens), beech martens, cattle, sheep, goats, hamsters and non-human primates such as rhesus macaque, stump-tailed macaque and squirrel monkey.‚Äù   From https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-8-493  Edit: oooh I‚Äôm tired! ‚ÄúSquirrel MONKEY‚Äù *facepalm*  Edit 2: There was an outbreak of some kind of prion disease amongst Appalachian people in, eh, the mid ‚Äò90‚Äôs or so, was it like 10+ people? At the time they said it was from squirrels. Too tired to find references now.  Point conceded!  Edit 3: I detest conceding, and do so only grudgingly.

Interestingly, five patients from rural Kentucky with probable or definite Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had a history of eating squirrel brains (Berger et al. 1997), and consuming squirrel brains has been proposed as a serious risk (Sekercioglu 2004). One might wonder whether this relates to the presence of a two-repeat PrP in squirrels.‚Äù   From https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00239-010-9390-7

mirznh,gt8k4iw,,The rural West Virginia types swear that squirrel makes great biscuits and gravy. Makes sense, cutting the pieces up real small breaks up the strands that make them tough and the flour in the gravy gives that greasy part of the meat something to do. And like any biscuits and gravy, if they just aren't good, add more pepper.   If you're getting animals from urban or suburban areas... you have to cook them well past what seems appealing. Boiling/stewing is a good way to get safe and tender meat from questionable game. In an urban area, avoid the organs - they can store up whatever the animal has been filtering from its environment, in rural areas, be sure to eat them, that's where some of the most important nutrients are.
mirznh,gt7bomg,,Ew, rather eat canned tuna in water, plain! I used to do this as a child because of my shitty parents not caring about having food for me.
mirznh,gt8i1i7,,I had a landlady who used to cook them up like hot wings. They were so spicy you couldn't really tell how bad the meat was.   I've also eaten guinea pig, which was really disgusting. They were initially domesticated for food and you can order them in restaurants in Peru, which is where I got it. I imagine squirrel tastes similar.

mirznh,,gt8jcuz,No, you just can't *only* eat rabbit. It's not nutrient depleting so much as it's just incomplete. You just need a source of fat to go with it.

mikj6u,,gtbagmo,I was turned away from the emergency shelter on 48th and Chestnut (or Market or wherever) because I would not agree to throw away my prescription meds. They did not offer a lockbox or any way for me to keep them - it was either get rid of them or leave, and getting rid of them was not an option.  Regarding your question...well, they are different yes - a DV shelter first of all has location anonymity, so the physical location of the building is kept strictly confidential, which is important since most non-DV shelters are obviously very open about where they are located and this makes it easy for abusers and violent ex-partners to track you down. The other main difference is that when you enter a DV shelter you stay there more or less 24/7 - you're not locked in, but it's not like a drop-in shelter where you get kicked out at 6am and then have to fend for yourself until 6pm or whenever.

mhjbqn,gszbyo2,,This too shall pass.  You have already endured more than most will in an entire lifetime.  Don't throw all the hard work away.  Is it time to check in for a psych eval?  A couple of days of safe sleeping and food will help.  Treatment should help. They might even help with services.
mhjbqn,,gszdepy,‚ù§Ô∏è
mhjbqn,,gt0np7g,Why are you pathologizing this person? They are poor, that‚Äôs it. Getting some psychologist involved so they can prescribe them with pills for being sad about being poor will only put them into medical debt making them worse off and they will still be poor
mhjbqn,,gt1iwkc,I think this person is recommending the psych ER visit not so much for pills lol but as a way to instantly meet a social worker in person who might provide a lifeline in some way. Admission to a program, a fasttracked application, local information not available online. Most places have closed down welfare offices, so folks are forced to call or email. Very difficult to keep calling and emailing if no one's responding.
mhjbqn,,gt1kptc,You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. By the way OP is talking they will immediately hospitalize them, hold them there for a week while providing zero actual therapy, drug them, and won‚Äôt solve the obvious problem which is that they‚Äôre suicidal because they are homeless. OP should NOT trust the mental health system or local authorities for help in regards to their mental health, they‚Äôll be put back onto the streets in a matter of time regardless only more indebted if they make the mistake of confiding in a psychiatrist or other authority about their suicidal ideation. They‚Äôll be force-ably hospitalized if they don‚Äôt give ‚Äúconsent‚Äù and likely be made to pay the bill for their confinement. It‚Äôs a predatory system
mhjbqn,,gt35xy1,I'd never suggest pills.  I'm hoping that by getting some needed attention she might find that lifeline mentioned by another person.   Only she can know what's best for her.  But she's tired, hurting, infected, and out of sorts. I don't know the streets.  I'll be the first to say that. But I can't sit here and not feel for her and provide possible options.
mhjbqn,,gt0y9nb,I agree. I‚Äôd stay away from psych doctors unless absolutely last resort. Everything they do is fill you with toxic pills that will add burden to your life and body.
mhjbqn,,gt5huib,This million times. I'm just astonished on how many ppl on here recommends her some fucking shrink to pump her up with their worthless drugs ,so she can possibly end up addicted and with all kinds of side effects.   Wish that ppl would realize that her problems are real (pain, homelessness , lockdown...) , so no amount of pill popping will change that.  Doesn't work like that ,if it would ppl wouldn't be turning into drug addicted zombies after they get their prescriptions. The only ppl to whom the shrinks help are themselves and their pharmaceutical overlords.

There are resources to guide you, and I understand being weary.  Maybe when you have one of these lows, dip your toe in the water and see what ripples back.
mhjbqn,gszvkon,,You've mentioned that everything is closed.  Can you get to a different state that has opened up more fully?  The squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Just because you've been turned down before or someone didn't listen keep knocking on the door.   Those of us fortunate enough to be not be homeless support these services and expect them to be provided.  No one can get by totally on their own. Our society isn't perfect but there are people whose job it is to help you.  We internet friends, I think, can give you suggestions and words to help you, but we can't give you the 1:1 help to really make a difference.    Please know, to be feeling this way with what you are dealing with is VERY understandable. It's hard to think straight sometimes.

I'm not homeless for now, but i'm depressed loser who has no will to live and i deal with feelings of hopelessness and guilt as well. I can't give you an advice on what to do ,bcs unfortunately i can't cure the depression, but i'd advise you that no matter what ,don't seek psychiatric help. The last thing you need are some shrinks to get you hooked on their pill popping. I'm actually surprised on how many ppl in this sub are recommending you psychiatric help. You aren't crazy ,you deal with a shit ton of real physical problems and there is nothing that the head dr. can do to help you. All what pills do, is making you addicted , while curing nothing ,but just masking the root causes for  a little while and creating new problems.
mhjbqn,gsztbrw,,When I was experiencing homelessness, I also felt that my sanity was most at risk.   It helps a lot to listen to music from Iya Terra. Try "give thanks and praises" and "life goes on." Those songs kept me sane, and even now as I go through chronic illness, listening to them helps me accept my situation once again.   Give them a listen, and repeat them. Sing them out loud.
mhjbqn,,gt036lv,I'll check it out thanks.
mhjbqn,,gt5f5m7,Let the bible thumping begin! So someone's life is shit and you listen to some religious song and all is good lol? That's fake positivity at it's finest.
mhjbqn,,gt5geah,Your comment makes it very obvious you didn't listen to either song, and so in your ignorance believe they are religious. Maybe try reading or listening to things before you make a judgement, so you don't sound like a asshat again.   You're upset, it seems, and so probably won't be open to hearing this, but I'll explain it anyway because maybe others will read it: we can't stop shit from happening to us. However, we have a lot of control over how we *feel* about that shit. We can either cry and wallow in self pity (I've been there too) *or* we can focus on gratitude and work towards a better today. That's our choice. The second option makes life without a home (and many other things) a lot easier.   It's important to cry when the tears come, but it's also important not to take a "victim identity," and to remember that this too shall pass.
mhjbqn,gszdtvf,,I hope you can get help with your nightmares. Psychiatrist should be able to help with that.
mhjbqn,gszdmfz,,It's not often that I write this prescription; I think you might need some drugs. Yes, it's a crutch, a terrible one....only this terrible because for a short time, it works.
mhjbqn,,gszfnea,Medication isn't terrible. It's lifesaving for most people that need it. It's not a fix all solution, but no one should feel guilty for getting whatever medical treatments that keep them healthy.
mhjbqn,,gszj2hf,I have dmt if that would help
mhjbqn,,gszj6lu,DMT always helps

mhjbqn,,gszk8a9,Nah, I won't. I'm too old to go there anymore. I stick with more conventional methods, ice to be all that I can be in the working hours, and O DesmethylTramadol w/ etizolam at night
mhjbqn,,gt5ghnv,Lol so you know it's a terrible advice but still recommend her to see some shrink ,get some addictive pills which do nothing but make you suffer more at the end ,just so she can get a temporary relief. Psychiatric help is one of the biggest scams ever. At least i imagine you are recommending shrink's drugs and not illegal ones. But regardless, the bottom line is , humans are not meant to search the "happiness in pills'. That's dangerous.
mhjbqn,,gt5it8u,Oh....i wasnt suggesting she see a shrink. However could you misunderstand me?  I meant.....she should maybe go get some Merh,  and Oxycodone and get out of her head
mhjbqn,,gt5trmq,Yeah i suppose i misunderstood you then. Oxy  or meth would help for a little while but that's a slippery slope too. IK i've tried with alcohol and didn't really do anything but create a new problem and expenses.

mgjmbt,,gsux3f7,Alright. I just assume they sent it there since that‚Äôs the last address they have on record
mgjmbt,,gsukee9,My understanding is that yes, you should be able to get it. You need to clear up your address with them and provide somewhere for them to mail to (PO box works, maybe a shelter if you can‚Äôt get a box).   It is okay to file taxes with zero income (or whatever you made). The easiest way to clear things up is often to file taxes (Free File or get a charity to help) using current information.   Dig around here for more info https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center
mgjmbt,,gsumkau,I updated my address on my 2020 tax return but it‚Äôs been processing for almost 2 months, so it didn‚Äôt update the address before the stimulus checks went out. I figured it‚Äôs too late by now but idk

mgjmbt,,gsum1gi,If you had a job then you just file a normal tax return.
mgjmbt,,gsusnro,Speaking from personal experience. I have. I havent recieved any of the stimulus, or any tax return for the prior 2 years. Theres difficulties with the irs and being homeless even when they have your banking information.   The irs call centers have been managed by some sort of third party call center with no training in any tax related issues that arent on the script they're reading (assisting with the high volume of stimulus queries). Since March 2020. IRS offices are closed.   I dont know what I'm to think. Feels like they have measures in place to make it difficult on people who dont provide them addresses. I've paid my taxes, I work hard. I get nothing.   Already tried using this resource as well and was turned away when they found that while homeless I had filed online and had my return accepted and been basically ghosted by the irs. Theres lots of working homeless in similar situations who'd benefit from knowing ahead of time as well.
mgjmbt,,gsuwj58,I used to be a tax preparer. You definitely should be able to see the status of previous returns online, homeless or not. If having an address on a return is required then they wouldn't have processed the return at all. There's a difference between an "accepted" return and a "processed" one. If you want I can try to help you figure it out.
mgjmbt,,gsuwqxv,They just stay on accepted. The last 2. And 0 stimulus or returns. And yes I would welcome help. Please dm me.

mddob3,,gs96c0l,Why is that? Never been homeless so was just wondering, is it dangerous?
mddob3,,gs96le6,They usually call the police. I had to find places open 24-7 and blend in their parking lots.
mddob3,,gse6vz7,Recently some churches put up "Homeless Jesus Sleeping On Park Bench" statues on their grounds and they all got the cops called on "Homeless Jesus" by local Karens.   So if the church itself doesn't call the cops, Karen might.

I worked ultra long shifts and I had a preplanned ‚ÄúI have a migraine I can‚Äôt drive‚Äù story just in case, since it does happen to me sometimes. I got lucky as I was only bothered by one drunk man offering me every drug under the sun, beer, and cigarettes, but I was always on high alert and never fully slept through the night.  ü•¥
mddob3,,gsaw9tr,I get the point your making about the churches but there are some legitimate reasons. Crime and space being big ones.  There was a church that allowed it in an area I used to live. It didn't last long. It was very difficult to keep up with the fast spreading garbage people left. Then the alcohol and drugs started appearing and then people just showing up to cause problems including teenagers/gang members prostitutes etc.  It started getting crazy quick.  There are a lot of people that take advantage and have no respect for anyone elses property.  There are still plenty of churches that will let you sleep in a car outside but it is done quietly and unless you are the one sleeping there you would never know.  As soon as the person in their car tells one other person and word spreads it all gets shut down.    If a church was going to do this they would need to just buy an empty lot away from the actual church and let it be an 'abandoned' lot. A free for all.
mddob3,,gsb0etn,I still ask why aren‚Äôt more churches helping their community if homelessness is so bad it would become a ‚Äúfree for all‚Äù in a parking lot once ‚Äúword got out‚Äù that a specific church was helping. I got more help with the animal shelter fostering my cat and dog than any where else. I understand I didn‚Äôt qualify during Covid being I‚Äôm a cis/het white female with 2 jobs and a car to sleep in, I was alright with people in more at risk groups taking those spots,  but homelessness shouldn‚Äôt be a thing in America to begin with.... especially when I was sleeping in my car a few roads away from Jeff Bezos and all his money he is hoarding that he will never be able to spend. The main thing that caused me to be homeless was my credit score. My student loans have fucked me for life. I refused to get a credit card because I believe if you don‚Äôt have the money, go without, other than HUGE things like school, cars, houses, etc. so my student loans have sat and ruined this magical nonexistent number which got me denied from housing even though I worked 2 jobs and 12-16 hour days just to go out to my car and seek a parking lot to sleep in. It would have been paid off if not for interest. I believe every human being at least needs 4 walls and a roof from the elements whether they work 16 hour days, or don‚Äôt work at all. I don‚Äôt get why this is such a wild opinion met with any rebuttal. We aren‚Äôt wild animals. Those ‚Äúprostitutes‚Äù need help with job sourcing, shelter, sanctuary, maybe even clothing and resume building. Those alcoholics and drug addicts need substance abuse help. I stayed sober, but I absolutely understand why people with preexisting addiction issues quickly spiral when homeless. You already feel like your life is at the end. I can‚Äôt imagine how much more agitated my depression would have been if I was an addict. I already wanted to die, but I needed to get my cat and dog back because I didn‚Äôt want them wondering why I gave them away. All those people you mentioned need help and seeing the root of their causes for why they feel the need to sell their body, damage their body, etc is how we stop and even prevent it. Garbage can be cleaned up. These are living people with real problems that should have more care in a country that proudly proclaims its ‚Äúthe best‚Äù on this world.
mddob3,,gse6zab,What are you, literally following Jesus' teachings or something here?
mddob3,,gvkemoq,To be fair, a church group would go around manhattan at night feeding the homeless camped out on church steps. I used to sleep for a short time on the steps of pne of them to evade the rain.
mddob3,,gvkepzl,Wish they would have opened their doors for all of you
mddob3,,gvpr8jl,I'm not homeless anymore. I got my situation straightened out.
mddob3,gs9ei14,,Churches are supposed to be communities that provide for everyone involved. They do try to do that in practice, in my experience, but it's not enough for daily survival the way it should be, and they vote against that very thing while saying that they want christian values in politics.   It took me a long time to see that.
mddob3,gs8yvzh,,Churches keep helping me, the government keeps screwing me. Tax political parties, defense contractors, lobyists and hedge funds if you want to see real change and actually increase government revenue.
mddob3,,gs93ytp,Stockbrokers need to be taxed too. As well as investment bankers.
mddob3,,gs9alu4,There's probably a massive list of banking, investment, and finance orgs and personel types that are undertaxed.
mddob3,,gsbayzc,Those churches that are helping you have the money to help because my tax dollars are covering their portion of tax that they don‚Äôt pay.
mddob3,,gsc0umu,As opposed to all of the taxes that the government pays or all the taxes other charities pay?
mddob3,gs92d35,,Do both
mddob3,,gs9ad8h,People's religions shouldn't be taxed :/  Mega churches that are literally just corporations should
mddob3,,gs9e8du,Morally, I get your point. Legally, though, how does one differentiate between the two?
mddob3,,gs9eh2k,I can't even begin to understand. I thought the same thing right after I posted it but we can't allow evil people to trample on others just cause they're cunts
mddob3,,gs9ixqw,Its real estate bro, if I pray in my house I don't get a property tax cut so why should they?
mddob3,,gsalauf,Because your house is your house and a church is a designated place of worship. Do you only pray in your house or do you also live in it, cook meals, watch TV, garden, etc? Most churches are barely scrapping by on donations. Trust me that little dish they pass around with like a handful of 1s and maybe a 5 isn't making anyone rich. It's going to paying the rent/mortgage for the church, paying for maintenance and any programs they do, and for bigger churches it goes towards humanitarian programs. That's like saying homeless shelters should be taxed because "it's real estate bro"
mddob3,,gs9d3ku,They're still a place of worship, even if they're filled with idiots.
mddob3,,gs9d62j,I think it's different. Churches are places of worship, mega churches are *selling* salvation
mddob3,,gsaib40,[deleted]
mddob3,,gsoychg,This is what I agree with. Doesn't matter how big your church is, if you pay tithing you're paying for salvation.
mddob3,gs92z4g,,This needs to be spray painted on mega churches and their pastors homes.... Or at least get a huge banner and string it up across the gates
mddob3,,gs98f75,Look up Mike Murdoch in Dallas! He's the one on TV all the time saying "plant a seed! plant a seed!"
mddob3,gs96mx0,,Churches that make over a certain amount should be legally required to house the homeless or lose tax exempt status. Also, since churches are considered non profits we ought to require them to disclose all finances to the public. That means salaries, investments, properties, income (tithes), etc. Why should they get a pass? If they do so much good that they deserve to be tax exempt than they can prove it on paper with regular audits.
mddob3,gsaxvmy,,Vandalizing a church helps no one and this just creates animosity toward the homeless.
mddob3,gs8ycbp,,Wrong way to protest the right message.  They could pay a homeless person to repaint that door though.
mddob3,,gs9q1e5,You know, they say the same thing about taking a knee during the national anthem.  Funny how it's always the wrong way to protest, ain't it?
mddob3,,gsrrk1u,This assumes that you'd have no problem with someone expressing their "First Amendment Rights" by spray painting YOUR house with whatever   their protest happens to be.   Let's see how you feel about it while repairing the damages.
mddob3,,gssqttk,I'm a super low income person who doesn't even live in a house. Spray away, genius.
mddob3,gs9bf6y,,Church is like the richest organization in the world how is that right
mddob3,,gsax036,Church? As in singular?
mddob3,,gsb4fec,As a whole
mddob3,gs8tba6,,This woman does NOT deserve a medal. This isn't the correct way to go about doing things.
mddob3,,gs9aa1c,It really isn't. Most churches barely make enough money to keep the doors open. Expecting them to do anything more than provide a house of worship is unfair, even more so to deface their property. It's just wrong. Many do provide meals and shelter for the needy though and I wanna say those people are great and I greatly admire their work.
mddob3,,gsawrpa,How do you all know it was a woman who did it??
mddob3,,gsax19o,Title of the post?
mddob3,gsav1tv,,How can churches be taxed in an Anarchaic society?
mddob3,gs8t0an,,That‚Äôs vandalism. How is a criminal act supposed to make folks want to help the homeless??
mddob3,,gs93jcu,Being black and sitting at the front of the bus used to be a criminal act too
mddob3,,gs9a53g,Yeah I'm not gonna compare the civil rights movement to vandalizing a church
mddob3,,gs9di7b,But do you understand the fallacious nature of the logic? "bad because it's illegal" is a naive perspective. Let's just take what the poster said:  "How is a criminal act supposed to make folks want to help the homeless?"   We might as all be whipping ourselves for breaking any number of laws we don't agree with or don't have the personal means, be it financial or otherwise, to reasonably obey. Someone could just as easily click their tongue at someone just trying to stay warm as "trespassing? How is a criminal act supposed to make folks want help the homeless?"  Is it a bad look? Yeah, kinda. Is it bad because it's criminal? No. Those are arguments used in bad faith to make people complacent towards criminalization of homelessness. I'm plenty sure there were folks just as confounded (or frustrated) by any number of civil rights activists at the time, thinking, "this is a criminal act. How could this make folks want to help minorities?"  It's not as great a leap as you make it out.
mddob3,,gs9elk2,I think you're kind of reading into it a bit much. I don't think they think it's bad because it's illegal. I think they think it's bad and that's why it's illegal hence a no brainer.
mddob3,,gs9pwh0,News flash: Lots of bad things aren't illegal and lots of good or neutral things are illegal.
mddob3,,gs9fb7e,I would think anyone would want things they think are bad to be illegal. Yeah, society has come to a general understanding of what vandalism is and why it's bad. But give me a reasoning for why it's bad, other than "it's illegal", since there's plenty more examples of things we consider basic rights that used to be illegal.  (It can be generally assumed that) Nobody got hurt from this. The church incurred a negligible financial detriment. What is there that's really "bad" about this?
mddob3,,gsaxgee,Would you be making the same argument if someone vandalized your tent?
mddob3,,gsnngbs,I don't know what that has to do with my argument. I'm not a church; I don't have the same resources as a church. I would be upset if someone vandalized my tent; but I recognize that reasonably, my tent is different than a brick-and-mortar property with legal deeds and titles.
mddob3,,gs9fsb6,It's disrespectful and ruins another person's property. What if I, for example, tore up a picture you really liked? Sure you could "incur a negligible financial detriment" and get another printed or even tape it back together but it's still a shit move and you would hope there'd be some system in place to stop people from doing that, especially when you can't stop it yourself. I mean there's your reason.   To be fair there's also things I don't agree should be illegal or I don't like being illegal but still respect. I don't trespass on other people's private land (unless it's disused), I don't hunt more than my fair allotment and only in certain seasons. I don't hunt or fish without a license. And I pay my tax to a private corporation to drive on public roads. And if someone asked me why they should do those things, I'd say "because it's illegal to not" because you gotta pick your battles and defending vandalism is a pretty shit battle.
mddob3,,gs9sp7b,It didn't ruin anything. It's paint.
mddob3,,gsaxkn9,So if I shit in your tent would that be ok? I mean it's only manure and washes out right?
mddob3,,gscdc22,Apples, oranges, assumptions....
mddob3,,gsautid,It's bad because some poor minimum wage worker is gonna have to clean that up and it's ugly defacing of somebody's property. How do you expect a society without laws to function if you have no moral compass?
mddob3,,gsnnn2y,> It's bad because some poor minimum wage worker is gonna have to clean that up   Okay....and? If they're a minimum wage worker, and their job is to clean the church, that was going to be on the docket whether or not spraypaint is on the door. You need to take your gripe to the church landowner/priest for overworking that worker if you want to rebut with "well that's in addition to all the..."  &#x200B;  >How do you expect a society without laws to function if you have no moral compass?  I don't expect society without laws to function at all, moral compass notwithstanding. Reread my first few comments and see how morality has nothing to do with law.
mddob3,,gsax777,So do a sit in at the church instead of vandalizing someone elses property.
mddob3,,gsnnijm,And who's going to notice that? are you going to see that posted on r/homeless?  Do you even understand the point of protest?
mddob3,,gs9pqra,If vandalism deters you from helping homeless people you probably deserve to be vandalized.
mddob3,,gscx9tj,No one ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù to be vandalized‚Äù. Geez, entitled much?
mddob3,,gsd7a3w,No, actually some places deserve to be vandalized. Concentration camps are justifiably vandalized.  I don't think you understand the relationship between vandalism and entitlement.
mddob3,gs91zsj,,No medal deserved.  This is deplorable behavior.

mbwvjd,,gs4xjmp,The folks that do Food not Bombs in Portland always have a vegan option, and often it's all vegan.   But that's also not surprising for Portland. Lol
mbwvjd,gs0i4jj,,Homeless people are just people. They like all the same foods as people in houses. Individuals may have different preferences, just like housed people.   Personally, I was never a big fan of pb & j or soup in the summer. I preferred feeding myself over going to soup kitchens or street feeds but there were a couple of groups that made great food. Those groups usually provided a range of choices.
mbwvjd,,gs1ctag,I realize homeless people are individual humans. However, your experience in the world as a homeless person has commonalities with many other people who are homeless. And there are differences between most homeless people and most homed people.  I believe that if you're going to serve ppl belonging to a group, it makes sense to ask questions, from people within the group, about what you're trying to do rather than make assumptions.  Ex. If a hammer company wants to do something for women, and doesn't get informed BY WOMEN, they may make a hammer pink bc they think that's what we care about, while in reality, most of us would prefer that the spacing in the grips be sized to better fit our smaller hands.   So I prefer they do some online customer surveys, put comment cards in the store, convene some focus groups, etc.

maca7h,grrrohs,,I'm in Jacksonville Florida and I need a new bag and tent.. all our stuff for wet and nasty and had to ditch it and now I'm having to use u-haul moving blankets and they are very itchy
maca7h,,grw40zj,You can make exellent and cheap shelters with simple tarps. That wont help with bugs and the like down there but it will block the wind and keep you dry.   Since I switched to using tarps I found I prefer them immensely.   Simple bug nets are fairly cheap and easy to deal with. They are small and easily fit into a little bag and into a backpack pocket. They are extremely light, don't hold dirt or moisture. No drying them out or problems with mold.
maca7h,grttt6i,,I highly recommend you go to the bus station and hand them out to the homeless there I was stuck at the bus station in Atlanta for 28 hours a few years back and the amount of people I saw tryin to hide out without a ticket so they could stay warm was nuts I'm sure they would really appreciate it

ma8jmk,grrcdk5,,I found the same thing: Zest and Old Spice soaps are really strong smelling. I mean I‚Äôll use up what I have, but going forward I‚Äôll stick with Ivory and ordinary Dial.   Btw, I so encourage what you are doing: soap was the very first thing that brought me real joy when I narrowly avoided homelessness.   Believe it or not, when I was a week or two sober, at that same time, just a few dollars worth of soap helped keep me sober.   Soap is incredibly important to dignity.
ma8jmk,,grrkbd2, Yes! Thank you I broke the code an got Dial and Dove personally I have a thing for good smelling soaps, my skin don't share its hyper sensitive. Reason I ask is this reddit is effing amazing people always help with anything. Summer is around the bend and I know we all gonna need a good lather.  Peace be with you!
ma8jmk,grro0k6,,I wonder if Dr Bronner‚Äôs all in one soap would be helpful in a situation where proper showers weren‚Äôt available? It‚Äôs a product that you can wipe down with a small amount on a wet cloth and not worry about rinsing, if rinsing isn‚Äôt available. It can also be used to wash clothes, hair, brush teeth, and really, just about anything can be cleaned with Dr. Bronner‚Äôs.   It‚Äôs sold in liquid and bar form. The initial purchase is a little more pricey than normal bar soaps but it‚Äôs really concentrated and the liquid can be highly diluted or the bars can be cut up into really small pieces that will end up lasting for so much longer than normal soaps.  My family has used it exclusively for face/body wash for years. It got my teenage son through puberty without having to deal with terrible acne. It doesn‚Äôt dry a persons face out but will also keep them clear. I‚Äôve used it for my personal face soap, for almost thirteen years and it out performs the far more expensive brands on aging skin. I‚Äôm sure being homeless with problematic skin would be so frustrating. I sound like an advertisement for the company lol. This has just been a thought, running around in my head, for a while.  I was thinking of setting up some bathing care kits with Dr Bronner‚Äôs, baby wipes, microfiber hand and bath towels, and maybe place them in two, small, stacked bowls (wash/rinse). I just can‚Äôt figure out if that‚Äôs a feasible idea for those without access to showers.  I could even add a toothbrush and a couple bottles of water. I‚Äôve found microfiber towel sets on Amazon that roll up really small and include a bath and hand towel.   Does that seem like too much to hand someone who doesn‚Äôt have the ability to carry much? Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking the whole thing. I just don‚Äôt want to add to a persons burden. Is it something they would utilize or does it need to be as simple as a care kit that can fit in a gallon size ziplock bag?   Again, I know I‚Äôm overthinking this and maybe that‚Äôs good or maybe I should just quit thinking about it and go effing do it.   Sorry I hijacked your thread.
ma8jmk,,grrs9p9,No, thank you I personally love Broner "Hippy Soap" its also a effing miracle for pets. My cat was licking his fur nothing worked on a whim I tried it and damn it worked! Gonna get a few bottles and distribute. I am setting up two  places in SD and LA please keep in touch. Shelters call me and I send personal goods and detergent. Theses forums the ppl are beyond open and honest about needs and wants and its wonderful. If my getting soap, shampoo and detergent helps anyone I am all for it. Never thought about pads / tampons until I was DMed on here and told its a much needed item. Also to the reddit on here who recommended I get American Spirit Cigs... must have been correct they were snathed up in a minute! LOL@@ Please keep in touch hoping we can come together and fight this crisis.
ma8jmk,,grsee5e,Yes! This is about all I'll use  for years now. And I must say, it does rinse away with very little water, so even if you are using bottled instead of tap it makes a great shampoo.  I personally find it to be a *bit* drying, but that is because it is so good at removing oils... and lipid bodies, which are what many viruses have.  It's also the best soap I've ever used for washing clothes by hand.
ma8jmk,,grvk9r8,+1 for Dr Bronner's :)  I'm very sensitive to sensory overload, and "baby mild" is AWESOME for me. :)  I also use "peppermint" for my smelliest parts, and "tea tree oil" mostly for hand washing clothes.  Target used to carry the small (sample) size bottles (2 and 4 ounce) of the liquid soap, which are a great size, and easy to jam into a backpack.

Perhaps manufactured in places that primarily employee homeless and disabled people.
m9frli,grocobs,,That‚Äôs amazing! One thing I try to purchase and donate is a flex cup. you should look into is saving for one, it‚Äôs a menstrual cup. It‚Äôs much better than free bleeding and better for the environment to boot. It also helps detox your body(tampons have so many horrible chemicals and we stick them in the most absorbent part of our bodies). Plus it minimizes symptoms(cramps,bloating,eliminates uncomfortable odor, shortens cycle length). It‚Äôs incredible! Best brand is Flex menstrual cups. Removal is just like a tampon which helps a TON. Target carries it or their website  https://flexfits.com/products/flex-cup?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpMvB-N3A7wIVEwnnCh1W9QNGEAQYASABEgLrXPD_BwE  Highly recommend ladies!!

m9m32g,grnr2h3,,I love getting mcdonalds and starbucks gift cards. A $5 gift card is enough to get breakfast and a coffee üôÇ
m9m32g,,grntql8,Gift cards can be a great way to get indoors (covid restrictions permitting) for a bit if it's cold/rainy/hot.  And they don't have to be used immediately like perishable food.  Edit: Easier to carry a couple around for the giver too, instead of bags of stuff.
m9m32g,,grnvftq,thank you for responding this is my first post on reddit! gift cards are very doable so i‚Äôll pick some of those up for sure.
m9m32g,grnvlub,,You can fight to end homelessness. Get involved with your community and state. Vote in local elections. Meet with your district representatives. Lots of people are doing things for individuals, not nearly enough people are fighting to make governments deal with housing costs and availability.
m9m32g,,grnwa4k,i am involved in some mutual aid (food not bombs and am trying to coordinate a free little pantry) as well as campaigning through my local chapter of the DSA for a candidate for my city counsel who actually cares about the homeless.
m9m32g,,grnwnvv,Sounds like you're already doing great things. Personally, I like giving cash whenever I can since that's another thing not enough people do.
m9m32g,grw5vj9,,just give money i guess
m8kr3l,gricdbl,,How do pictures like this help anyone?
m8kr3l,,grkscqb,ummmm... dunno, could it be 400 years of stealing their resource and natural wealth to build fancy buildings/universities in europe?
m8kr3l,,grlknhm,And this picture of one individual helps change or fix that?
m8kr3l,,grn5uxj,well dumbass, go read a history book then  stealing the resources from asia, africa, americas, to build the fancy palaces and building in europe, jesus fucking christ
m8kr3l,,grnf7pw,Are you drunk or something?
m8kr3l,,gstt89j,Malaysia is an afluent Asian country. African and many Asian countries have lots of natural resources yet their people are suffering. You can't blsme the British, Fr or Americans for that. So calked poor nations are ruled by corrupt, heartless men. Also, local cultures don't really allow for success or nor are they compassionate to the poor.
m8kr3l,gri3qxx,,Is he okay?
m8kr3l,gri8ajo,,What is the point of this? The homeless sub is for homeless folks to discuss stuff and allies trying to get resources to those in needs, not folks just posting images of folks without their knowledge.
m8kr3l,,gribqum,I don't think OP meant to offend anyone..  Just an image showing the desperation and desperation of being destitute. If anything, maybe it'll shock someone into doing something good..  On the other hand, I'm in Florida and I see multiple people stretched out like that on the sidewalk every day and nobody really cares
m8kr3l,,grictfi,What I'm saying is, I don't know anyone who's exerperienced homelessness who would think posting a picture like this is appropriate.   Why take a photo when you could throw down a couple bucks or leave a meal or anything besides taking a photo of someone on one of their possibly worst days for a bunch of anon spectators online.
m8kr3l,,grl3fhk,I'm really hoping after OP took this picture, they gave this man some food or a few bucks to get something to eat.
m8kr3l,,grw63cl,ive been homeless, i'm meh about it
m8kr3l,,grx94ns,Reading your post history, it sounds like you chose it voluntarily and had a financial buffer with the option to pay for hotels. Yes, homelessness is homelessness, but there are degrees to it. For example, you having a tent vs this person being splayed out in the open. I mean, this person could just be passed out with a camp set up somewhere else, but my main point is, putting someone online to have their life speculated on endlessly, like I'm able to right now is just tacky.
m8kr3l,,grks5yr,you lack empathy and compassion, heartless
m8kr3l,,grkzndc,Are you talking to me? Because elsewhere here you talk about this as a result of colonization, and yet it sounds like you think poverty elsewhere should be available for the western world's consumption which feels like a reiteration of that? Not trying to have that conversation, just pointing out what feels incongruent to me. I'm saying this is in the vein of trauma porn, and while in the past I've thought of documenting the poverty and homelessness around me, I've opted against it unless the person as a subject had input and gave their consent-- anything short of that is exploitation. The ony photos I've been ok'd to take were portraits on days folks were feeling good, but then again, I wouldn't ask someone for a pic like this.
m8kr3l,,grn670h,hey idiot, what the fuck is trauma porn? jesus fucking christ, go outside and get some air and sunshine u basement dweller  the reason why so many countries are underdeveloped is the direct cause and causation of plundering of resources without development  have you looked at how the railroads are laid down in africa and asia? to ship out the products out of asia/africa to benefit certain colonial powers  read a fucking history book u idiot
m8kr3l,,grn6j3e,I literally agree with you that poverty existing in most places because of resource theft and colonialization. You're picking a fight where there isn't one and seemingly have my views pegged for something else.  Oh, and I live outside, so I get lots of sunshine, thanks.  Considering your account is a day old, I'm gonna guess you're OP on the attack, but I'm willing to be wrong.

m8udsx,,grl9s5m,oh sorry about that i read it wrong. I understood that as something else.
m8udsx,grm11yf,,If you have a car, gig economy jobs can really help out. Shipt, Instacart, Doordash, UberEats, Amazon Flex, Bitesquad, etc.   Another option you can do to find work quickly is to call all local and a good amount of national staffing companies and ask them what the highest paying job they have available with your work experience and credentials and write them down on a piece of paper or in an except sheet along with the person you talked with and phone number and staffing company. Once you‚Äôve done a good amount, you can compare and contrast the pay for each job and then make a final decision just so you can get some money in your pocket and start saving.   I would also try to find a roommate or two so that you can share the cost of rent. Roommates.com tries to match people with similar personality types so that you get a good roommate/roommates:  https://www.roommates.com/  Or even Roomies:  https://www.roomies.com/  I hope that helped!
m83j28,grg2rk9,,Dude bacon and pineapple is an amazing comboination. Im sorry this guy scammed you. Some people think you have lie to hustle but most of the time when your honest people are more likely to help you.
m83j28,,grg48jd,Honestly I'm behind on rent this week and everything but I would have given him $5 if he was honest and explained the situation to me   I get it..its 7pm at a scary bus station in Tampa Florida and a huge thunder storm is rolling in. I can't blame him for pulling some BS like that. But the part where he referred to my pizza as "shit" after playing the "im so hungry" card kinda made me mad.  But I'm not going to let that make me bitter or stop me from being helpful. Because like I said, he must have really needed $2 if that's the scams he pulls and he deserves it.
m83j28,,grg4iu8,And yessss thats one of my favorites. I know its not a cookie cutter combo, but bacon pineapple isn't that crazy.   #1 if you were really hungry, any kind of food would be a blessing and if the toppings really made you sick you could always pull them off.
m83j28,,grg4vv8,yes i completly agree. When I was homeless as a teenager and I would be spanging for change I would just tell the people that I needed money for a room for the night. Usually i would be raining and most of the time it was men staring at my boobs giving me the most money. But i learned very young honesty is the best way to hustle.
m83j28,,grgd1fq,Well, not necessarily. I thought picking the jalapenos out of my nachos would make it ok for someone to eat, and it didn't because it leaves residue on the food. It was a dick move to offer it to her after I'd picked them out and I still regret it even though I apologized and she forgave me. Stupid.  He was just being rude though. Bacon pineapple is a pretty dang good nutrient profile for a pizza.
m83j28,,grhz7d2,I don‚Äôt like pineapple on pizza, but the time I got a few leftover slices as a kick down, I just picked them off and put them on my mans slice. He could use the vitamins anyway.
m83j28,grfw8bu,,One thing for sure, trust has to be earned. We can take a chance, but it ain‚Äôt going to be trust. Trust is thru tried and true.
m83j28,,grg1f4w,Yep, very true. Just sad to see how dishonest the world has become.. homeless scamming other homeless people is pretty low and I imagine if he keeps that operation up, he's gonna play with the wrong cowboy and get hurt
m83j28,grg3tze,,I don‚Äôt trust very many people in this world been beaten as a kid kinda does that to you, just like the deal of ‚Äúnothing is ever free‚Äù works with people trying to sell you or give you something. I try and help people with problems because I‚Äôm a bit autistic, I like to help others I don‚Äôt want anything in return when I do. If I got the time and the item the person needs I help them out. I don‚Äôt trust people who say they want to sell me something it‚Äôs always a scam. Also never tried bacon and pineapple, I gotta try that.
m83j28,,grg4tqh,Yes you helped me get information and youre very helpful and always do your best. I won't forget that and I dont check my messages very often so if you've written recently I haven't checked.  And yeahhh, BBQ sauce, bacon, pineapple and sometimes chicken is delicious.
m83j28,grm4ntu,,I had a neighbor who tried to scam me the same way, only he said the reloadable bus pass had $200 on it. I tried to get him to prove it but he "forgot" the password. I said no. He sold it to his gullible ex-girlfriend, obviously without telling me. She found out it was empty.  She had monetary troubles beforehand, but losing $200 was a big blow. The guy never had any money so of course she couldn't get that back. She became homeless a year or two ago. (The neighbor himself was always on the verge of homelessness until he died last year, due to something other than COVID.)
m83j28,,grnbl42,Wow. That's pretty ridiculous, but its unfortunate people gotta scam poor folks just trying to get a good deal.   Glad you didn't take the bait..Can't imagine blowing $200 on a fake pass

m83j28,grggim4,,I lost quiet a few bags of smashed aluminum cans. A sizable chunk of my income. But put this in perspective. How is it any worse than the local gym making it next to impossible to cancel a membership and continuing to bill people for months after they thought it was canceled? Or any number of regular business practices in the business world? What about the prices of asthma when the manufacturing cost has barely changed in 40 years? Pretty much every money transaction you engage in with legitimate business has far more erroneous cost built in than that $2 bogus ticket.  That doesn't make their behavior any better or easier to swallow when you get targeted. I tend to befriend housed people and avoid any kind of deals with homeless people. I've given my good feather coat away to a homeless man but I would never make a deal with that coat and expect the deal to be honored. I'll reserve my moral discontent for those that engage in nefarious practices on a much larger scale under the cover of legitimacy.

m83j28,,groq5xf,That is very kind of you and I'm so happy to hear that things are going well with you guys and you were able to leave that shelter! I know that wasn't a good environment to stay in and being "free" must feel amazing üôÇ  Thank you, so much for that offer..but for the time being, my rent is paid for the week and I even have a little extra money, but you know it won't be long until I'm in a bad position lol, so one day..I might take you up on that.   But today, go out and get yourself a little treat and maybe a little something special for your cousin or the kids! You really deserve it my friend
m83j28,,grow072,I can help you out with $60 at a push I know you need a $100 I've got my stinky and  I know you didn't get yours. It's just so upsetting your one of the genuine people on here. Stay safe and I hope I can help you. I hope you get the rent money you were asking for :)
m83j28,,growxpg,Wow that is really kind and honestly I'm always behind on everything and I was really counting on that shimmy to get me out of this motel because it sucks up 95% of all my money, but I am grateful that I have a roof but things like food are a luxury now üòÑ

m75f6d,gr9ah85,,My own Bitcoin investment is also aimed at (hopefully soon!) purchasing a farm to serve as a non-profit space to freely house volunteers who serve the larger community in some creative or practical way.  I currently own 1 acre of land right now that's a sort of [beta testing for the larger project](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholisticenchilada/comments/dcrjed/a_place_to_start_create_space_beta_testing_help/), if anyone here is in Maine, and has building skills, there are openings for folks to help make the land livable (we need an outhouse first, then hopefully a drilled or dug well, a greenhouse/geodesic dome, cold storage for food, and so on).
m75f6d,,gralu5x,Right on i want to do the same thing in Oregon or Washington closer to my family! I've heard people call this setup, an intentional community. If people had affordable stable housing to fall back on in a bad situation, it would ease so many worries.

m75f6d,,grasugz,The land is in Searsport.  I'm not living there now, as it's not legally livable. The only thing that is absolutely required is a permitted outhouse.  So that's my priority.  Though water is also kinda crucial as well, no pun intended. :-)  I had intended to start all of this last spring and summer, but then Covid happened, and I couldn't even get to the property (from where I was in Cambridge), since the buses stopped running.  I'm currently living in an apartment one town over in Belfast.  And yeah, most any help would be greatly appreciated!  There's plenty of space to camp, even with a camper/RV.  There's a brand new, small cabin/shed on the property that is just storage now.  There's also an open shed that needs some love (and a new roof and maybe a door).  Here's a video with a basic concept of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBLjidroJ5Y

That's what, one-tenth of one percent of the homeless? "Normal" people like the extremes, because they can't see themselves in them. The idea of homeless people with jobs, bank accounts, mailing addresses, email addresses, or anything else that they themselves have makes homelessness too real.

m60p1f,,gr674qm,Check with your local community service agencies (or the irs) for free filing options.    There should be a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) or Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program.  Edit: probably not in person due to covid, but virtual should be up and running.

m3wt24,,gqrfqp6,What else happened to you?
m3wt24,,gqrh2zx,Quite a bit, I didn't just go from client to staff at the shelter. There was a period of 2 years between where I just put my head down and worked on getting myself in a more stable environment. I've had been homeless off and on from 16-36 and had a number of bad habits to break. After living in the same place for 3 years now (smashing my old record of 4 months) and making a good group of friends I'm about as close to living a normal life as I think I'm capable. I play bass in a shitty garage band, I work in a job I love and I'm finally in a position to be the father my daughter deserves. 3 years ago sitting in the shelter if someone told me I'd be where I am now I'd call bullshit. I'm not exactly king of the world but I'm pretty content with my lot in life.
m3wt24,,gqrjabf,So you've been through a lot well I like to read all these reply's. It sounds like your in a perfect situation where you love your job. So many people hate there job and Its a major stressor for them. I like the job I got. Its valet and I'm in good standing. I just pray that I can return to work with no issues. If I lose the job it will be a major setback.
m3wt24,,gqrk1rq,I hope you get back to your job man, sounds like your in a pretty stressful situation but should the worst come to pass you said it best. It's a set back, all be it a major one a set back can be over come. Easy things to say from the other side of adversity I know but you'll get back on your feet.

m3wt24,gqrdmrz,,On the bright side?   You're not giving head for a fix and sleeping in an abandoned car, so there's that.  That was extreme and I'm sorry for that. Think positively though.
m3wt24,,gqre1rx,That's very true I am not addicted to drugs or sleeping in an abandoned car. It could be worse I could have a bunk bed.
m3wt24,,gqsrvv0,Or a bunkie without the bunk bed. Now slide over and stop hogging the blanket.
m3wt24,,gqrf7zb,That's the spirit.  Have a great night.
m3wt24,gqrc0rd,,I'm at the schwartz assessment center in Manhattan. I just got out of quarantine because my roommate got covid 19. I was setup in a hotel. In a few days I'll be back at another hotel. Pray for a good roommate and a hotel close to work. I've been in the shelter system since 2018. I just got a full time job and was looking for a room to rent with no credit check. Not so easy. I'm only making minimum wage. And I had to call put of work. Last time I was here was christmas. The place was packed and dangerous. There was also mice jumping out the cabinets. If anyone has a room to rent no credit check get at me asap.
m3wt24,,gqrcf16,I was in jail for about a year before 2018. I was homeless in 2016 but moved back in with my parents for a short time. My dad kicked me out into a homeless shelter. I'm a drug free clean and courteous fella. I am looking for a room to rent as close to midtown west where I work as possible.
m3wt24,,gqrhjnw,I used to live on Morris Ave, Bronx and get the express D train to Lincoln Center to study. Cheap rents sound there and the Fordham Area.
m3wt24,,gqrjqho,I talked to a guy at work and he's willing to rent me a living room for 650.00 a month. But I've been trying to see the place for nearly two months and he always is busy. It's in grand concourse. To be honest the bronx kind of scares me. I dont know my way around and I hear it's the worst borough.
m3wt24,,gqtp7qc,I am British, POC, single woman and lived there alone. Fordham has the University, so the vibe is better around there.   Much better then Hunts Point, which has a red light district and large commercial plots, that are dead at night.
m3wt24,,gqsswc6,Check out r/roomandboard

m3wt24,,gqrex3j,I'll have to check again. Now I just message the owner and ask if they do long term? Like longer than a month
m3wt24,,gqrf3uh,Download the app. Then you can search available rooms and set the price filter for your desired price range. Cheapest i found just now are a little under 600/month.
m3wt24,,gqrhh5i,Can you get those prices with privacy?  Like with a private entrance?  Studio?
m3wt24,,gqrjatl,Hm probably not. The cheapest ones are like boarding houses or hostels.

You can't expect to sort it all in one go, but if you make consistent 1% improvements, you'll be in a better spot in no time.   Best wishes, and God speed
m3wt24,gqs8axw,,you can jump on the train all hours of the day, no need to live in Manhattan. Brooklyn is too pricey. The Bronx, some parts of Queens, and even Staten Island are doable. Jersey City is close to downtown. I'd look for rooms in all of those places. Problem for you, more than credit check, would be background check. Many places in Manhattan ask for them. Hit up the place your at for ideas.

m3z49j,gqsxun5,,You seem to be sort of fixated on categorizing or classifying people into groups.  My advice is to treat every person you meet as an individual. That is how I want to be treated. What difference does it make how old, what race, what gender, ethnicity, background, country, or any other innate characteristic a person is or belongs to?  I treat other people as an individual person. Like I am. We all feel pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness, loneliness, hunger, etc.....so knowing that.....what else matters when you see someone who needs help?  Part of this world's (and country's) problem is segregating people into different teams and rooting for one team over another. Existing isn't some sort of contest. If you can make someone happy or sad - then choose the former not the latter.
m3z49j,,gqt3b5y,Your point is valid and was actually the same point I made to someone below in a response earlier but they got downvoted so the posts don‚Äôt show up. But anyway it was simply an observation I made. I do think those who are in ‚Äúpower‚Äù try to get us fixated on our differences so that we bicker with each other. It‚Äôs not lost on me.
m3z49j,gqsy2sb,,The word "Boomer" is considered to be an insult.   Pronouns are annoying.   Many older people here are raising the children of their dead or otherwise incapacitated or incarcerated drug-addicted millennial children.  Fentanyl has been especially harsh in taking them out permanently.  Some elderly people can't negotiate the foster care and criminal justice systems very well. There is an older lady here that works as a cashier, raising two grandsons, at CVS. The parents are either dead, in jail or not able to care for them at all. (Can't even remember. I hear this story so much.) She is well past retirement age.   Some are just plain scammers...like you get in the rest of the panhandler population.  Could be a lot of reasons really.
m3z49j,,gqt3tfy,I dunno, their generation is literally called ‚Äòbaby boomers‚Äô. Negative connotations tied to ‚Äòmillennial‚Äô exist as well. I have seen some of what you‚Äôre talking about however- those that are retirement age and older getting stuck with having to raise their grandchildren.
m3z49j,gqswu9i,,Most of the street people where I live are way over 40.  Many are hard core substance abusers, mostly booze.
m3z49j,gqrrli2,,I can confirm there are many elderly homeless people at the shelter. I'm in Manhattan and I'm homeless. I get called out and just upfront asked can  you help me get something to eat today. About half of them are elderly. I'm homeless myself so I dont help. Some of them know I'm homeless and still ask me for money.
m3z49j,,gqsteg8,Tell us more if you dont mind  you think u could ask around if your shelter is seeing more senior people? if so any statistics?   this is just unacceptable in the richest country in the world and in our most prosperous times, we have 18M millionaires, 18,000,0000!!! and we have seniors who cant afford rent of a meager place to sleep at this old age.  those 18m millionaires made their money off the backs of this blue collar workers, who are fucked physically and some mentally, and now they say fuck those workers, we've used up their "good years" with backbreaking work like construction/mining/whatever else
m3z49j,gr0s32j,,I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised. The older people often estranged from family or can‚Äôt work anymore. There‚Äôs no help from the state or it‚Äôs really difficult to access.
m3z49j,,gr0tswk,This makes sense.... I‚Äôve heard complaints from older people who aren‚Äôt even homeless that they make the whole ‚Äòsystem‚Äô difficult to navigate. My moms best friend said her state made it a pain in the arse to apply online to get the covid shot. Almost like that was by design. It takes my parents hours to fill out any form online and the system makes it a headache, and my dad is fairly tech illiterate but my mom isn‚Äôt, and she still gets frustrated at it at times. My mom still prefers to do things in person but with covid still around that‚Äôs not much of a possibility.  Apart from the not being able to apply in person in some states (for whatever various service or aid), the homeless have limited or no access to the internet, which adds insult to injury.
m3z49j,,gr0x77y,Despite what many people want to believe. The gov or state only appears to care about individual citizens. So the state does some good for some people some of the time but the truth is that u are best to always be independent of the state as much as u are able. This is why kids need parents that are invested in u and able to really parent because if u do not establish a good attachment with your kids u will be ignored by them in your later years if u treated them like shit. This is why many older people end up alone. The real reason is because in older generations we were heavily encouraged to take care of our own and not rely on other people. No care homes or day care, gov school raises the kids. This is why family was the biggest priority in older generations. Because nobody was coming to your rescue to bail u out of times got hard.
m3z49j,gqrsi6f,,\>not realizing boomers created the problems you mentioned and unironically, willingly giving them even money after they continue to rob you blind without apology  more like advanced duh-gree
m3z49j,,gqstuwf,come on bro, some of the boomers had no say in this and some are probably regretting it, lets not paint them all with a wide brush  i know so many poor seniors, who came here after the vietnam war, (fuck wars, and fuck kissinger, he should be hung instead of getting nobel peace price"  the people who came here after the vietnam war, mostly are still poor, living in a meager home, the poorest ethnicity in america is cambodians, when u compare average % of cambodians living below poverty  it breaks my heart seeing 60-80 year olds ladies/gentlemen pushing carts to do their groceries, and the stuff they buy at the grocery store is so heart breaking.   its often less than 20$ and its mostly just some veggies and absolutely essential cooking stuff, like rice/beans/flower and oil   america goes to vietnam to continue the french war, and in turn makes south east asia bomb crater, did you know more bomb was dropped in LAOS, a country we werent at war with, than the total bombs dropped in WW2? also they used arent orange and other nasty stuff
m3z49j,,gqrt8e9,I‚Äôm fully aware of those issues. I can count the good boomers I personally know on the fingers of one hand. Most lived in a very spoiled time of opulence and wealth and a lot of them have squandered it. Some want to spend all their money and leave nothing for their children. However- I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre ALL like that. Every generation gets categorized into these less than desirable stereotypes. I know mine have certain stereotypes, as does the next one coming up. I don‚Äôt like to categorize all people into this one monolithic thing, people individually are so much more than that. But keep assuming you know what I think.
m3xg1r,gqrhbp1,,If ya get ya stimulus check go find room to rent you don't want to be homeless baba

m2z5fn,gqm8pej,,I was homeless as well with my husband we became homeless when he got pancreatic cancer but I have seen so much kindness and I just wanted to point it out that a lot of people point out the ugliness but they're so many kind truly kind people out there so the ones that are reading this from the bottom of my heart and my husband's whoever you help thank you so very much
m2z5fn,,gqo407u,I had a grizzled old homeless guy in Mountain View California tell me I'll need to "get some faith" because people are so mean and I said on the contrary, my "faith in humanity" has gone up 1000X once I started panhandling because I never realized how many good people are out there.   (Don't worry I'm housed up and even have work, and in the Before Times my side gig was busking so  I still got to meet nice people. It's gotta be something like 1%-2% cranks and the rest range from fairly nice to really nice.)
m2z5fn,,gqp5a28,It's funny, when I panhandled and asked people on the street it wore me down and made me resentful a lot. When I switched to a sign all the assholes completely ignored me and I only interacted with the people who wanted to help and that made me feel good about people again.
m2z5fn,,gqqm8lc,Yeah I never did the sign thing but I think if I did, I'd get into making signs that are funny alongside the begging sign, and let people have them or sell them.
m2z5fn,gqlz1rf,,This is so nice to hear. Happy for you!
m2z5fn,gqm8yx9,,This is probably an indicator that you have been spotted and framed at least in the truckers community and probably around the town community too... Be extra careful Jess, other people might not have the same "good" intentions as that trucker. Stay Safe

m2z5fn,gqmsm4g,, Most truckers are good people. My son is a trucker.  He donated several tubs of food to a local homeless shelter today.  He is a #raisedrightman
m2z5fn,,gqmuvsw,And it's funny, but back when I did sw, I loved meeting up with truckers.  I know I was viewed as the lowest form of life out there, and well, still am, but most of the time I was treated good.

m2z5fn,gqmwluc,,Happy for you I'm scrambling to come up with a tent or tarp now
m2z5fn,gqph8e1,,I felt the same exact way when i was previously homeless a couple of years back. I hated getting phones because no one called me - so why waste the money i barely had to spend it on just internet data and spam callers? Some one would try to steal my phone when i slept, or high roll me with a low ballin offer. but the pros of having a phone while homeless, is that it keeps u on the grid to find housing resources, and you can keep your paper trail of personal info uploaded to a cloud client, and call for help if you are in some trouble, and to shut that crummy environment out and zone out to your own playlists, or take your mind off the usual stresses of being homeless and meditate on yourself and your life.
m2z5fn,,gqt0zdp,yeah, but all I will do is want to call someone, like a wierd stalker, just to hear her voice. but she dont want anything to do with me. And I dont want to disrupt her life, so, I can do that with my tablet, well, I used to be able to, now it dont play sounds, usually no vids either but its ok.
m2z5fn,,gqtpwb5,I tried connecting with someone when I met her being homeless. She just wanted to use me and didn't really like me in that way..So fuck it. PPl DON'T ACT RIGHT ANYMORE..

m2jf7a,gqjru3z,,There is a new Reddit for financial help.  It is for people that really are interested in helping others.  This is not one where people should advise them to go to a church, shelter, or other resource in their community.  Such things do not always work for everyone.  Policies prevent a lot of it.  Time and red tape are problems.  Understand that most people are probably not comfortable asking others for financial help.  As for scammers, be smart.  If you can‚Äôt tell you are being scammed, maybe you should not be on here.  Don‚Äôt be stupid.  You know the feeling something isn‚Äôt right.  Go with your instinct.  I‚Äôm going off of my own personal experience with this stuff.  It‚Äôs a hard place to be.  Please be compassionate and help if you can.

m2jf7a,,gqlx3z3,All fast food here went cars only. Closed their dining rooms. While places like golden corral allows dining space where you keep your mask on outside of your table area. Other places near my sleeping spot can't agree on how to do it either. One coffee shop shows inside sitting while another one close has gone pick up only, also they refuse cash now. Other places on that same block has refused cash too. Lucky there's a dollar tree that still takes cash.  Note: please don't go "I thought everyone has a bank account!" I don't, we all have our reasons why. I have a PayPal but I can't get them to cash my stimulus checks either because of that, or because PayPal didn't give me an option to put " iii " for the third as says on my checks.  I'll tell my story later, I dislike tap on mobiles.
m2jf7a,,gqm5sgq,Oh yikes. Sucks. Dont know what else to suggest then.
m2jf7a,,gqnfwaj,Use Chime.
m2jf7a,,gqnism2,its their thrid party check cashing company thats the problem, and they seem to doninate the online check cash industry. Paypal uses them, so does net spend. if anyone can confirm chime doesnt use Igmo (ingo)? then ill try. but not willing to sign up with every single entity out there that will refuse to cash a government check.
m2jf7a,gqlrqlc,,I know my local VA has wifi. While you may not technically have legitimate business there, the VA is used to having homeless people around and it's unlikely security is going to hassle you unless you make an effort to bother people.  You can also frequently use guest wifi at a variety of places if you're willing to live without 'climate control'. While I'll acknowledge that this isn't practical in the middle of a rainstorm, it's merely uncomfortable in heat/cold.  If you merely need a place to ready/study, many public parks have open-air enclosures like gazebos where you can sit down. For that matter, you can find an out-of-the-way bus stop.  Inarguably, the pandemic has made it more difficult. However, the same rules apply that always have: look around for good places and avoid making a nuisance of yourself.
m2jf7a,,gqlxom2,This sounds a bit local to you because nothing you said would work here or the last city I was in. But don't worry, maybe someone else didn't think of this, it's just that often times people think that if it available there, it's available most other places.

m1b679,,gqfab1l,I agree.  I've seen booth the same.  A crisis brings out the best and worst in society.  It forces us to show our true character.  I have had some people treat me like shit.  But then I've had a few Angels that have looked over me and kept me safe.  So yea.  It's been a mixed bag during this pandemic.  Or as I look at it.  More like a fruit cake.

Im running the heat just a little tonight it's not too cold but it's chilly I need to invest in a blanket üòÖ I have just been using my jacket with the wool inside as a partial blanket I think I'll try to pick one up tomorrow still sad about loosing my weighted blanket a few months back because I forgot it in a hotel roomüòû
m1kkco,,gqf69ia,You couldn‚Äôt get it back?
m1kkco,,gqf7v86,They they tossed it kinda pissed me off but I guess it's my fault for leaving it I guess I understand because it a blanket and not like a phone or a wallet something along those lines
m1kkco,,gqfswxh,Still. It‚Äôs someone‚Äôs property. They should of paid for the replacement, but yeah, good luck getting a reimbursement if it‚Äôs not a chain.
m1kkco,gqg8pdh,,I remember these days. . .to think I'm going to be owning my own place soon, wow. Things get better man trust me, just hang in there. I'll pray for you and I hope blessings come your way.
m1kkco,gqe8r59,,He's upper middle homeless class. Hes got a car
m1kkco,,gqfzklr,thats hilariosu thanks for the laugh hehe   we have the lower middle homesclass class in - a sleeping bag and a cardboard  middle class homeless in - tents with a propane stove  upper middle class homeless - a sedan/hatchbatch  upper class homeless - a van with shower and stove  i wonder how the upper crust of the homeless are living?  perhaps in a 5 million dollar vacation home by the coast, they use/borrow/squat while being undetected    haha, we should write a piece about this and send it to the newspapers n shit
m1kkco,,gqghpsn,upper might be subsidized SRO room in San Francisco
m1kkco,,gqha768,Look at this guy thinking he's so fancy.     Kidding of course.
m1kkco,,gqe8yxu,I hope you have a happy night maybe listen to some good talk radio.
m1kkco,,gqe9syo,He already gave the backstory on his vehicle in previous posts .
m1kkco,gqfzabe,,I have been wondering how you are doing.  Glad to hear you are warm and hunkering down.  About the weighted blanket, have you called their upper management?  Maybe it's there and they just don't want to look for it.  Anyway, I will pray for you. <3 Huge hugs
m1kkco,gqgf3s5,,Kudos for every effort! This isn‚Äôt easy by any means. Stay strong. Keep those vibrations raised.
m1kkco,gqhcnpb,,I always slept in the backseat, propped my phone up on the armrest and watched movies and whatnot on my phone.  Hope you slept well.
m1kkco,gqgvwmk,,Times are tough and you‚Äôre sleeping in a Mercedes lol
m1kkco,gqe7dgx,,Are u baiting people with all these pics of your mercedes?
m1kkco,,gqgs6to,Given the lack of any infotainment system - that is nowhere near a new / expensive benz.  I'm betting well over a decade old.
m1kkco,,gqht1pe,Pretty sure it‚Äôs a sprinter van.  Hardly a luxury ‚ÄúMercedes ‚Äú
m1kkco,,gqe8wlc,I'm not baiting wow.
m1kkco,,gqeo1yq,Don't worry he must just be new.   You have explained this 1000x over.
m1kkco,,gqfzov6,i was just about to accuse him of why the f living in a benz lol, whats his backstory for the uninitated?
m1kkco,,gqi28y4,From an earlier post:  >bought this car back in 2009 when I was 17. I'm almost 29 and still have this car. I keep it well maintained, and I'm at 150k mile mark.
m1kkco,,gqi8xf6,thanks for your time,  yeah benz station wagons are so sick, my favorite, i wish i could use it to live out of it, almost unbreakable if you maintain it well
m1kkco,,gqg8ww4,When I became Homeless I had a pretty nice car. Long story short we where doing good but we decided to move states and live with my uncle. He was being pretty abusive so we had left. We didn't have anywhere to go and we where homeless in our car for awhile in a totally new place.
m1kkco,,gqg9wzy,i feel ya brother,  yeah people are quick to judge when someones is living out of benz/bmw/lexus,  shit they arent gonna break down as often and hyundai/kia, and will be more incognito  and a new entry level honda/toyota is like 15-20k, and new entry level germans cars are 30K+,  when people are doing well, thats  50-100$ extra month for car payment for a nicer car is worth it, until some unexpected circumstances happen   thank you for sharing your story
m1kkco,,gqgb8to,Reading back now it seems like my story wasn't that bad but you just had to be there lol. I'm so glad I'm out of it. I have a new appreciation for the homeless. I always tried to help but now i feel like I absolutely HAVE to help! It's ridiculous, there should be options for those who are homeless.
m1kkco,,gqgcb9u,this is how i feel about the homeless problem in the world  so many assholes get rich off the natural resource, like oil/gas/mining/minerals/land/  that these fucks stole from the native population by war/disease/famine/genocide  the state/government should provide every living human with a right to housing and food, and use the resources from the natural resources to pay for our housing/food.  its what? like only a few dolars a day to feed a prisoners, and give the people a small studio, for gods sake and we'll have a brighter future in my opinion  so i used to work with the at risk community in chicago area, including being a mentor for big brothers big sisters, went to uiuc for finance&accy, we have to give our children, who are our future, a fair start in life  right now its about 70% of the children in CPS(chicago publlic school) experiencing food insecurity at home and about 10% are homeless  like what kind of society do we want in our future? bunch of poor uneducated, mentally abused kids to grow up to be... what?   im at loss of words where our society is going
m1kkco,gqg9yew,,Kinda hard to feel bad for some one living in a car that's worth more than most people's homes right now...
m1kkco,,gqgpn26,The housing marking is at a peak... so no its not hard.  Someones worst and other peoples worsts are still "worsts". I also don't think OP said - hey look at me , feel bad for me. If that was the case it would be a selfie and a GO FUND ME account.   Keep your head up OP, stay on the right path and I wish you much happiness in your endeavor.
m1kkco,,gqgrlfg,More or less what om getting at here is we don't NEED these luxury status symbols that only purpose they really fulfill is as an extension of one's member. Priorities people... if you find yourself living in your benz MAYBE just MAYBE it's time to sell the extremely over priced piece of machinery get a cheaper car and idk a home perhaps??
m1kkco,,gqgtc3y,I see what you are saying except that car is old enough by far to be paid off and is most likely the only form of transportation/Shelter and a place to store their things.   IF they chose to get rid of the car and make 3-5000 on the car ( if that) then what are they going to do with the money? one months rent, food and other expenses?  How will they get to work?   this vehicle is serving multiple purposes in this persons life.   If the Vehicle is not paid off .. the payment is still cheaper than anything else right now
m1kkco,,gqgucef,That things is push to start and I'm guessing a 2016 at least you'd make far more than 3/5000 try like $15/20,000 depending on condition and that my good sir will get you pretty far.
m1kkco,,gqlpzie,That's not push to start - Also I am a woman.  Not Sure where you are getting your car values from but ok what would I know ha
m0ta5f,gqa3nnu,,Yes, I cannot help but feel jealous when I see wealthy ppl my age out having fun without a care in the world while I struggle just to get by day after day. Its depressing so I try not to think about it.
m0ta5f,gq9zcy9,,The growing disparity between classes is a major precursor to a falling civilization.
m0ta5f,,gqalqo8,Actually, it is not the disparity between classes that leads to civilization failure.  It is the hardening of the barriers between those classes.  Stiff barriers lead to bad incentives; weak barriers lead to good incentives.  If transition between classes is easy, then most in the lower/underprivileged classes can see their way up.  This provides an incentive for hard word, persistence, and inventiveness, which raises the wealth of the people who provide them - and the net wealth of the civilization.  It also means that those at the top can envision falling downward if they get too lazy or dishonest.  **Civilizations fail when the barriers between classes are too high**, when a poor person knows that no matter how hard he works, he can never own a decent home because the nice neighborhoods have been redlined for people of his race.  Or when a member of the royal family can mistreat other people, knowing that he will never have to answer for it because the king is his cousin.  Civilizations fail when there are too many competent, skilled people who cannot improve their situation by conventional, legal means.  If the barriers are too high, then the ambitious among them turn to crime and/or violent revolution.  The less motivated turn to drugs, booze, and suicide.
m0ta5f,,gqam1ho,Thanks!
m0ta5f,,gqanq1l,(the king is his *brother*)
m0ta5f,,gqi0nr4,Give it time. Once the stimulus checks and increased UI stop coming in, we'll all be left to fend for ourselves.
m0ta5f,gqa3hdx,,Very much so. But predators are going to predate. Nature abhors a vacuum, and where something or someone can be exploited, somebody with the power to do so will take advantage of it.  What pisses me off far more is how utterly complacent, docile, and apathetic the general public is about at all. it pisses me off that they not only lie down and take it ‚Äî but that they turn a blind eye to other people getting trampled by the system and the sociopaths in power, even when they're getting it much worse, even when it constitutes gross human rights violations. It pisses me off how people will celebrate and simp for plutocrats, politicians, massive corporations, and petty rulers and enforcers of all stripes ‚Äî while blaming and gaslighting their victims. The anger I have at those holding the wealth and power does not compare to the anger I have at the general public which both passively and actively enables them.  I was really hopeful that was going to change over the summer with the protests ‚Äî but that all failed as election season approached, and people started putting their faith back in the rich and Powerful to save them, thinking that if only the "right" people hold all the wealth and power everything will be okay and they can go back to brunch. And while I am very glad that the Tangerine Tyrant has been evicted from office, the utter complacency that has returned to the general public in his wake has been soul crushing. How swiftly they've returned to the belief in the system and the process just because a more dignified and polished psychophant for the corporatocracy, who bothers to put on a facade of caring about the people struggling while he props up those keeping them down, is absolutely pathological. And it's inexcusable. People should be ashamed of themselves. And as far as I'm concerned, so long as people continue down that path, they have no rational grounds to expect civility, tolerance, or respect of their rights from the people whose necks are under the boot ‚Äî whether it be homeless people, the working poor, people of color and other marginalized groups still being targeted by discrimination and violence, people being persecuted for victimless crimes, or the immigrants still being held in concentration camps ‚Äî err, I mean, "overflow facilities". A system at a society which permits these things, and makes no serious effort to address them in a timely fashion, has no right to exist.
m0ta5f,,gqbh9tm,god damn you are hitting all the buttons  dude, like the media brainwashed the poor and working class to think they are middle class, no u dumb fucks, u are poor working class and should fight for your rights instead of voting for the interest of the rich, and tax breaks for the upper crust  i really hoped the protests of 2020 and the virus might change something, but i dont think we had enough people to die to change anything in society  i was hoping all this misery and pain will make the general populace realize that food and shelter should be human right,  but i dont think its happening  you know dude, i actually wanna go about a way to sue the city/state and force them to provide food and shelter for all. isnt it like part of the UN human rights declaration?  I think we gotta force the system or else its never gonna happen because greedy fucks will be greedy and will take a life, no problem.  im afraid to death of becoming a investigative journalist, its my passion, but i know im gonna end up suicided or find incriminating evidence on my laptop and go to jail
m0ta5f,,gqaa9ye,This is SO well stated. Thank you for saying it.
m0ta5f,,gqb8dzd,This ^^^^
m0ta5f,gqbd67a,,I used to love watching a real estate show set in LA (the brothers with the women realtors) until one night the original blonde realtor went shopping and she was buying shirts, jackets etc some were $5k for one item. I actually was sickened at the OTT opulence. It disgusted me and I felt sick for watching it when so many are on or under the bread line. It was embarrassing and gross. I loathe the disparity between the filthy rich and the rest of the world.
m0ta5f,gqa8wc9,,It kills me to know there's hungry people right in the neighborhood I live in.i help but I know I can do more.  I hope no one takes this wrong, I went hungry as a kid so I all ways knew if I wanted anything I would have to get it myself.
m0ta5f,,gqbwz7a,Where I work I have to toss so much fresh food I mean pounds of food gallons of soup bread lunch meats. I could feed so many ppl.  Makes me sad. I do this 5x a week.
m0ta5f,gqaqvnj,,Not at all. Personally I am happy to fall deeper into poverty if it means my boss can laugh with his friends and throw little paper airplanes made of hundred dollar bills into thr fire place on the same night i was told they couldn't possibly give me a dollar raise.  FML.
m0ta5f,gqa3ncn,,One thing foreigners will tell you is that the homeless problem is so noticeable in the United States they're confused as to how we live it with it. It's a common theme when I talk with Europeans, they're baffled by guns and homelessness.
m0ta5f,,gqasto7,Foreigners get an overly romanticized view of the US. They are fixated by the "America" that they see in movies or on social media. They love places like Hollywood or Manhattan or even DC but those places also represent just a fraction of what the US is. Literally, the moment you step outside of the shiny parts of Manhattan or LA there is horrible poverty. The fact that there are deteriorating shithole cities or rural poverty like Appalachia doesn't even cross their mind.  When you romanticize a place it's easy to overlook the bad. Then when they are confronted with reality they experience shock followed by denial.  Then the people in the US are delusional as fuck. They don't see the problems because they outright refuse to believe it even when the obvious is staring them in the face. They live in their own little bubble.
m0ta5f,,gqajyf3,Family actually means something in other cultures. Our is a uniquely barbaric culture.
m0ta5f,,gqip00y,It's a plague of western civilization as a result of not caring enough to give a helping hand to the underclass. Families are torn apart due to indifference from having to obey the laws of capitalism day in and day out. This creates more homeless people who have no one to rely on. I say, bring on socialism already. What do we have to lose? We have so much to gain.
m0ta5f,,gqartr1,We have less homeless than many places we just also help them less too.
m0ta5f,,gqy863r,i think the U.S. actually has more homeless per capita than many developed nations..idk
m0ta5f,gqa6x0i,,It's not just homeless and poverty anymore.  It's just over broke.  Most of the country is just over broke and being exploited.  Insane rent costs, no reasonable way to buy property, all good paying jobs cost hundreds of thousands in education that has little to do with the job.    You are forced to use expensive automobiles instead of public transportation in most cities.  Each year it gets harder and harder to access the medical system without putting yourself in more debt.  The costs of raising children have exploded.  Meanwhile the quality of public schools has gone down since anyone rich or in the majority won't use the system.  More of these people need to wake up and realize they are not to far away from being destitute and homeless.
m0ta5f,,gqb7ltm,This is the central problem.of most of america and highlights the folley of the trap many get in
m0ta5f,gqc0iuq,,I noticed a trend in the middle class: buy homes, quit working. That's scary because they are relying on rental income for their sole income and that only means one thing: higher rent. And it is happening. I could afford a 1 bedroom solo 20 years ago. Today, nope. It's all because someone doesn't want to work and wants to play landlord until the day they die.
m0ta5f,gqalpm0,,Dude, just my two cents, but im pretty sure anyone and everyone that works like a dog, is homeless or part of the working poor, feels this way.
m0ta5f,gqamon7,,This is the entire history of mankind.  The haves & havenots!
m0ta5f,,gqcqw2k,I came here to say that.  The difference is that the US and other western civilizations have programs to help people.  Sure, more can always be done, but it's the best it's ever been.  In the past, you starved on a dirt road if you couldn't contribute.
m0ta5f,,gqg5pyx,This is not true. If you were homeless in Ancient Rome, you would have been treated with compassion and given food all the time if you stayed in the city center. If you starved, you either lived in a cave or avoided other people altogether. If you were really desperate, you would have built your own shelter and lived off the land. Tax free, of course.  Google this stuff. It's pretty interesting.
m0ta5f,,gqd3acd,Except prior to the enclosures of feudalism people were allowed to build homes and cultivate land any place that was unoccupied so self-sufficiency was always an option.  Now we can't plant corn on an empty lot without running the risk of a trespassing fine.
m0ta5f,,gqyc85n,or use plant seeds that have monsanto trademarked dna in them
m0ta5f,,gqd5ih8,Different world, but the same human condition.  Even when people could plant corn anywhere, many didn't and starved to death.  They probably had hard lives and convinced themselves of their victimhood.  Some things never change.  The world is a harsh place.  Where do you think the saying "life is suffering" came from?
m0ta5f,,gqgvdha,I don't share that view.   Natural history shows time and time again that cooperation is a major factor in evolution and human history shows that war is a relatively recent development. The invention of the wheel is older than the invention of war.
m0ta5f,,gqd2kyo,Not the whole history, just the last 800 years
m0ta5f,,gqyb2we,is what you are saying how people fall into the believing the myth of being able to pull yourself up by the boots straps? the "entire" history of mankind, before you make that claim I would think what you are saying depends, on what people having are going without. in feudal Europe where there millions of homeless people living throughtout Europe? We might say they had miserable condition maybe but at least they had places to live.  In our own time most countries have nationalized health care plans, while America doesn't. Can you call that part of an age-long struggle? It looks more like not even keeping up with the times.
m0ta5f,gq9ss4c,,Yes. It pisses me off to no end, as a legally homeless person.
m0ta5f,gq9zxcx,,To no end. All of it is about where you were born too. Its like an underground caste system. Fucking bullshit
m0ta5f,gqa1zpt,,Checkout r/LateStageCapitalism and you will find many who are pissed
m0ta5f,,gqa8gw6,The problem over there is that they're pissed at the wrong things. They highlight the problems correctly but then want to give *more* power to the corrupt government that has created these problems.
m0ta5f,,gqarpvt,Are you sure we looked at the same sub?              And what do you think should be done?
m0ta5f,,gqcfxry,They treat "capitalism" as some boogeyman that is responsible for every single one of their problems.   For example, they correctly point out that using significant amounts of tax money to overthrow democratically elected governments in the middle east and south america is atrocious for both humanitarian and economic reasons, but then they turn around and say "look what capitalism has done".   They look at these stimulus packages and see how much money is going to large corporations and the rich, but then blame capitalism instead of the government who is squandering their money and their future.   In the same breath they'll say, "if only the government was in complete control of our healthcare, things would be better", as if forgetting the corruption, waste, and atrocities of that very government that they were just bemoaning.   The solution to wealth and income inequality is freer markets, not more government. As the US continues to slip lower on the economic freedom index, they keep blaming these economic failures on "capitalism" and "billionaires" and anything but the political elite who are actually creating these economic conditions.   I don't blame them for the rage and anger that they feel, in fact I identify with it. It's just sad that they keep enabling the very systems that are oppressing us.
m0ta5f,gqawu34,,It makes me mad but yet it motivates me.    I want to have all that wealth and power but only to do whatever I want.   Like setting up public showers with *hot* water, building fire pits, helping public libraries and gardens.   I want what they have and to say they shouldn't have it would mean that I can't accomplish my goals.
m0ta5f,gq9tcru,,Every single day.
m0ta5f,gqa7jkz,,Yes, I have been saying this for years.  We spend money unnecessarily and bail out so many other countries.  It's appalling.
m0ta5f,gqa6754,,Well now, wait a minute! I've been homeless (multiple times) before. I'm not now, neither do I have millions... or thousands, for that matter. But I am buying a house on 3 acres... and I have to get up at 4am and work 6 days a week, but that's what I have to do to get what I want. I don't want anybody to give anything to me.
m0ta5f,,gqab9bw,Good for you that you can get up at 4am and work 6 days a week. Some people can't even if they look physically healthy and fully functional to you. Considering the amount of wealth we've amassed in the US, affordable/guaranteed housing should be a foregone conclusion.
m0ta5f,,gqafxuw,As a single parent I couldn‚Äôt do that either. The earliest a daycare will open is 6am.
m0ta5f,,gqad0mz,I look physically healthy, but deal with copd. Like I said I gotta do what I gotta do. As a homeless minister (meaning I'm music minister for a church for outside people, we meet outside), it never ceases to amaze me how many of our folks can afford cigarettes and lighters. I'm just saying.
m0ta5f,,gqagckl,And it's commendable you can do that. Some people can't. Everyone lies on a spectrum of mental/physical wellbeing & ability. For some, all they're good for is spending however much they have on cigs. That should not preclude them from getting all the help they can get, especially housing and food.
m0ta5f,,gqarubh,[deleted]
m0ta5f,,gqbb5t7,I should know. I smoked for 30 years.
m0ta5f,,gqab120,[deleted]
m0ta5f,,gqakcf6,this bootstraps shit is bullshit. rich people prey on poor people. wealth is generated by labor and stolen by the rich. just because you decided to be a bootlicker doesn't mean thats the only path out of the gutter.
m0ta5f,,gqam6l0,[deleted]
m0ta5f,,gqamv5i,I'm sorry. we should all do what you did and buy a trailer for less than the cost of 1 weeks rent in san francisco. then I guess I'll be able to come to this sub and call everyone lazy. america is fucked up and people should not have to go hungry without shelter, healthcare or access to basic services.
m0ta5f,,gqd50ch,Maybe instead of calling all poor people lazy you could engage with op's argument?
m0ta5f,,gqak65z,You were both lucky and smart. Smart because you didn't fall for the college scam and you learned useful things like hvac and painting and so on - that work is always available and needed.
m0ta5f,,gqanx1l,I remembered in late 80's and 90's of McDonald's had workers with bachelor degrees because there was no work for them so they were trying to get into management that way. That was the beginning of the student loans defaulting because they couldn't pay it back. Sad.
m0ta5f,,gqao4ds,Out where I am, you get a computer science degree then learn to make those patterns on top of a latte... college is a huge crock of shit that ruined my life and that's why I try to warn others.
m0ta5f,,gqao8sm,Ouch!
m0ta5f,,gqas3sr,I just want an end to capitalist exploitation and universal healthcare... I feel like I could climb out of the hole if I knew I had mental healthcare and guaranteed heart meds.
m0ta5f,,gqbbdmq,I used a website called [Needy Meds](https://www.needymeds.org/). I was narcoleptic with catoplexy and copd. They paid for a very very big chunk of the meds.
m0ta5f,gqaawkv,,We are the richest country in the world AND the most Christian. "Land of the free" was always a lie. The whole thing was based on a lie.   If the far Left would get their shit together we could have a real Revolution after uniting with the Right against the Ruling Class. The truth is becoming more and more obvious.
m0ta5f,,gqb1ds4,As far as I know, this has been tried before. The Red/Brown Alliance does not work, because in the end the right still wants marginalized people to be dead/subservient.
m0ta5f,,gqiwkos,It can be done. We have more in common than we have different.
m0ta5f,,gqixwj5,What we have in common is that we're all working class. If this alliance succeeds in revolution, what comes next? They will want us dead!!! Do we fight them or change their minds?
m0ta5f,,gqqwjrc,I don't think they want us all dead. I think they want a chance to get a decent job. We can resume our regularly scheduled radial hatred after the revolution.
m0ta5f,,gqqx0sp,Right, what happens after the revolution? Will the right-wingers just leave the left alone? Generally speaking, the left wants to provide for everyone's basic needs. As far as I know, there aren't any right-wing ideologies that have that as a goal; they just kind of oppress marginalized people (which is nearly everyone on this sub). What do we do to get the right to understand that socialism is actually better than capitalism?
m0ta5f,,gqtbdub,I don't believe that most of the Right are out to fuck minorites. I believe most of the right wants the stuff most people want. A good job and an affordable lifestyle.   I also believe that many on the right are proud to be able to support their family without welfare and food stamps. I believe most on the left would agree to that.   And ultimately: it's the corporations that are fucking us all. I think that is pretty widely agreed with too.   Corporations paying a livable wage and paying their share of taxes is probably an easy sell for most Americans.
m0ta5f,,gqtowr7,I agree with all of that!!! Polls show that most folx want the same things: Paid parental leave, m4a, free public college, higher minimum wage, etc. My issue is with how we take power for the people. So far we've seen that voting and incrementalism don't work very well. Life expectancy has decreased while the wage gap has increased dramatically. People have been tricked into voting against their interests thru corporate and military propaganda.  So my main questions are: How do we change minds, and how do we do a political revolution?  We've seen what the ruling class will do to us in order to protect their interests. They will not let us vote away their power.
m0ta5f,,gqy1i7m,If voting doesn't work there is really only one other way.
m0ta5f,,gqy2rpn,Indeed. So if we don't want to go that way, then we need to organize around real candidates that have our best interests in mind. We must also hold them accountable to us as the workers. We are technically the largest block of people in the country, but the ruling class has, like I said before, tricked nearly everyone into voting against their interests. Not only that, but they pummel down any possible policy that could help us. A real organized general strike would do more for this country than any policy in the last 40 years. We need to build our own safety nets for each other so we actually have that power and provide for each other when we are striking.
m0ta5f,,gqasir0,> uniting with the Right against the Ruling Class.  Uniting? The right does not want to help anyone and they just want to be the ruling class and were brainwashed into licking more boot and people are poor because they are lazy and deserve it. The fucking right? Lol.
m0ta5f,gqb6ys8,,A thousand times yes.
m0ta5f,gqbgg1p,,I couldnt agree more OP  I was so depressed at the state of the world when i was about to finish college, i dropped out with 1 credit left and became a monk  when i was a monk, i had a small room to sleep in, breakfast and lunch, no dinners, and 3 pieces of cloth and a bowl, nothing else. (well besides beddings and a pair of sandals)  It made me realize as a human, we could be happy with FOOD, CLOTHING and SHELTER, (plus medicine and education and what not if we are able to)  this situation makes me so depressed i dont know how im still alive, and imagine our situation in america where we can usually beg for food and get it, imagine the millions of kids starving in yemen and other war torn countries, when we throw away 40% of the food we produce, and that includes transportation, labor, growing harvesting etc...  ive given up faith on humanity, im hoping people will realize and rise up one day and have a revoultion to keep the rich in check so no body goes hungry or homeless
m0ta5f,gq9zrtp,,Yes. It's very difficult.
m0ta5f,gqc0z68,,No, why should it?  More importantly, why do *you* care? Because what I've found is that this sort of dwelling-on-irrelevancies is normally a way of not facing the actual problems in your life.  Imagining vast and inscrutable forces conspiring against you is easy. It's comforting to think it's all someone else's fault.  But it's not *useful*. You're going to wake up tomorrow in the exact same place. You need to focus on those things you can control and how you can personally improve your situation, not on vague theoretical injustices.

m0ta5f,gqd3ivi,,The Rich and the Kingdom of God  **16**¬†Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, ‚ÄúTeacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?‚Äù  **17**¬†‚ÄúWhy do you ask me about what is good?‚Äù Jesus replied. ‚ÄúThere is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.‚Äù  **18**¬†‚ÄúWhich ones?‚Äù he inquired.  Jesus replied, ‚Äú‚ÄòYou shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, **19**¬†honor your father and mother,‚Äô\[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2019&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23782c)\] and ‚Äòlove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô\[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2019&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23782d)\]‚Äù  **20**¬†‚ÄúAll these I have kept,‚Äù the young man said. ‚ÄúWhat do I still lack?‚Äù  **21**¬†Jesus answered, ‚ÄúIf you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.‚Äù  **22**¬†When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.  **23**¬†Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. **24**¬†Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.‚Äù  **25**¬†When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, ‚ÄúWho then can be saved?‚Äù  **26**¬†Jesus looked at them and said, ‚ÄúWith man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.‚Äù  **27**¬†Peter answered him, ‚ÄúWe have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?‚Äù  **28**¬†Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. **29**¬†And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife\[[e](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2019&version=NIV#fen-NIV-23792e)\] or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. **30**¬†But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
m0ta5f,gqy5ek5,,yeah. If you have ever been poor and had the experience with of spending  time with rich people, or someone who is a lot better position then you in some way, depending on how much a piece of crap the person is or not, you will see how careless and privileged they feel, and by what excessive behavior they have.

m0v1bk,gqaeus2,,Congratulations, that's amazing! I had the same thing happen to me last month and got $750 in EBT  Treat yourself to a few nice meals and make the rest last! Fun fact, subway and wawa and a lot of other fast food places will let you use the card to buy cold sandwiches/salads!
m0v1bk,,gqakpzc,Yep lots of sandwich etc places in my town take EBT now. When I retire I'll probably be eligible for EBT and if so, I'll go on it. It's an economic stimulus plan run by the dept. of agriculture.

m0v1bk,,gqai500,I figured but left my comment for those that don't know.
m0v1bk,gqaey0e,,Also curious, what do you do with your cat when you're panhandling or going into stores/bus?
m0v1bk,,gqaj9yc,He was pretty young when i became homeless and ive stayed camping in the same spot so as not to confuse him. He just hangs around camp while im gone and meets me at the head of the trail when he hears me coming back. No dangerous animals in this particular canyon so he is free to nap in my sleeping bag or play outside. I dont even on a pet carrier or leash. He doesnt know how to hunt so i doubt he would ever run away since unlike the strays he is dependent on me for food and water. He is fat enough that the stray cats dont fuck with him either. He is a real homebody and never goes more than 20 ft or so from the camp.
m0v1bk,,gqajy2i,Wow that's really cool..you replied to my post a while ago asking how to take care of a cat when you're camping and I see a lot of people ask that. I'm glad you have him and he is happy and safe!  Maybe even splurge on a little something for him when you can get to the grocery store. I'm really happy things are working out for you and I'm sending good vibes your way my friend!

m0v1bk,gqbqj2d,,Hey not sure if you how your camp set up is but if it's feasible for you try supplementing your cats diet with inexpensive meat it will help you save cash for essentials and it's super healthy for your cat :) I am no longer homeless but I am still on ebt and I make my own dog food it saves cash and I don't have to take from the very limited pet food pantry. If this isn't a workable option I completely get and hope I didn't come off as pushy or anything. Good luck with everything

m0v1bk,gqaki7f,,EBT is a good, FDR 1930s program run by, can you believe it, the dept. of agriculture. That being said, for me with no dependents furry or otherwise, I kind of liked panhandling. It was less of a song-and-dance than staying eligible for EBT, and I felt like it was more voluntary on the part of those supporting me - they could do anything from tell me to fuck off to handing me $100. Fortunately I only had to do it for 4-5 months, and moved on to making handicrafts, "picking" for antique stores, etc. But this was in the Before Times.

lwysip,gpk3qry,,i know the feeling as i have eaten at food banks myself ,it is very sad to see the ragged clothes and all the faces ,and then the realisation that i am one of them . Its a fucked up place we are in right now .
lwysip,gpkda3x,,Cheaper housing could help to end so much of this, rents are so out of control in cities I thought they would go down, in Miami its getting damn scary..... we are close to 30% jump. I know I am gonna get scalped... but its time to get this country open... seeing whats up ahead time to get moving.
lwysip,,gpkdeva,Truth
lwysip,gpjzx29,,Society doesn't care. As someone who works in sales, it's all about the next dollar for the person above you. The human experience doesn't care if you can afford the thing your selling, but make sure you're up selling to maximize your profits.   I take it from a perspective of the homeless man I was. I know people are strapped, and going through shit.
lwysip,gpkxhnv,,r/LateStageCapitalism
lwysip,gpknnk9,,where I am, because of COVID-19 everyone in line is all walks of life. Not just homeless. People are hard up
lwysip,,gpl9uqe,I ate black beans on white bread today, twice, and was grateful for it. Never thought I would say that...but it's true.
lwysip,,gplsv3i,Where I am, because of covid all the food banks are now drive-up only, which prevents a lot of the poorest people from accessing them.
lwysip,gpjxwmn,,I firmly believe in the universal basic income. It works in parts of scandinavia
lwysip,,gpk0jfl,Is there other countries that do this too?
lwysip,,gpk32yj,Yeah, a few are conducting small trials. Finland, Germany and Canada for example.
lwysip,,gpk3a7p,The Finnish know what they are doing!
lwysip,,gpk0dh7,Don‚Äôt we already have something like that with SSI, welfare, etc.?
lwysip,,gpk2qht,No, all those things are means tested and a pain in the ass to get. UBI means every citizen gets a cheque from the government every month, giving them enough money to live off. For those that earn enough to not need it, they end up paying it back through taxes.   Have a read about it. It's a bit of a radical idea but it is proving quite effective.
lwysip,,gpn0hrp,Not only is it a pain in the ass to get, they don't give you enough to survive on. I'm on SSDI and it's not enough to rent anywhere but HUD housing, but it takes years to even get HUD housing and HUD housing is literally the worst housing I've ever been in.
lwysip,,gprv815,Have you looked at Nebraska or Iowa apartments? Relatively cheap apartments there.
lwysip,,gpuaraw,Not cheap enough on SSDI, which ranges anywhere from like $700 to $1200 a month. After you factor in rent (which most places require you make 3x the amount to even get approved), then comes utilities, which will eat up the rest, leaving nothing for food, entertainment, savings, emergencies and other miscellaneous expenses. Even if I could afford an apartment in that area, I definitely would not live there for my own safety as a brown trans queer autistic person. Also one of the things that keeps me going and not feeling suicidal on a daily basis is spending time in nature - cornfields and flat grasslands doesn't cut it. Also, cannabis has helped a great deal with depression, insomnia, ADHD and pain, more so than any prescribed medication I've taken over the years, it's not legal in any of those places. I would actually be surviving, nevermind thriving if I could afford my own apartment there, I'd just be waiting to die alone. Maybe most people can stand apartment life, but I can't, I absolutely hate it to the point to where I'd actually rather just live out of a tent/boat/RV until i can save up for a down payment on a piece of land or a house because with rent being so high, it's the only way I'm going to be able to afford my own place that is truly mine before I kick the bucket.  I did spend a few months in Lincoln, NE once when I was 18 and homeless for the 1st time, someone tried to hit me with their car, on purpose. It was also one of the most boring towns I've ever been in, and it was bigger than the one I grew up in.
lwysip,,gplxcmz,Yeah, well, you needed to vote Bernie, or Yang. We didn't do that so we could coddle to the REPUBLICANS (the guys that don't give a fuck about you). Since then, Our coddling Biden's been busy doing his coddling...... So.... Yeah. Nothing for you! Nothing for me! Nothing for anybody but the corporate class. Nothing but BS all around.
lwysip,,gpmagmf,While I agree, yang is a capitalist at heart and doesn't really support any form of social safety net like free healthcare or jobs programs because of ubi, which is a phenomenal stepping stone towards better quality of life here but it's not the end all be all.
lwysip,,gplthnn,Also, apart from SSI all the "welfare" is temporary.  You have stuff like food stamps and TANF which you can only have for a certain amount of time before you're kicked off.  UBI is for life.  And SSI is not just means-tested but requires you to be disabled, not working and with practically no assets.  It usually takes years to get and having it prevents you from taking any other steps to improve your life.
lwysip,,gpljb6f,Its belly flopped repeatedly. Pretty much every time its been tried.
lwysip,,gpmsmpg,Really? Any explanation as to why?
lwysip,,gprnvta,Google "why UBI doesn't work" and tons of results come up that explain it better than I can here. It has been tried in various countries and locales and shut down in just a few months. It costs a lot, drives prices of goods and services up, and disincentivizes people from working and contributing. Lovely in theory, not so much in practice.
lwysip,gpksytm,,To quote my brother: Darwinism.  You sink or swim. It shouldn't be like this. A nation that has trillions for guns & bombs has the means to be feed it's people but the elected powers don't want to decrease their wealth.
lwysip,gpkiohf,,I agree with you on every level.  It is disgusting and unacceptable that in one of the richest countries in the world we have homeless.
lwysip,,gpmalcx,It's because we're the "richest country". We have the richest rich people and they do nothing but essentially steal from the working class.
lwysip,gplwmqv,,Wait till hundreds of thousands of the 10M people unemployed claims‚Äô ends this month.
lwysip,,gpm5t4i,Yep, I think people will join together morenso than any other time to change all this shit that society considers normal. Together, there is nothing us Americans can't do. Fuck this individual bullshit mentality that we have been assimilated to so those oligarths stay in power oppressing all of us. Together we can stop this cycle of madness and abuse.
lwysip,gpmo81f,,I agree. The United Nations has declared food, water, housing, and care to be essential human rights but meanwhile America is still being ruled from the grave by a handful of dead white dudes who didn't believe other humans were even people.

lvo3lg,,gpecrgx,Silicon Valley. Literally a violation to sleep in your vehicle inside any city limit.  It doesn't even matter if the vehicle is on private property, like an RV on your driveway.  People do it. They just have to 'hide' it.

Sounds like you're in a "not so much" area. It really sucks when a location you've gotten comfortable in and gets ruined because of something stupid like that, but it really sounds like it's time to move on if you can.

luxys3,gp9ntph,,I'm really sorry you are experiencing that. I myself, am not homeless and have never been, but I've joined this group to get a better understanding of what people who are homeless go through, so I can learn the best way I can help. I'm not sure where you live exactly, but there are so many places where people don't act like that. Granted, there will always be those types of people regardless of where you are at, but it really sucks that you and everyone else has to deal with them.  Is relocating an option for you? It may be a way to improve your situation as well as open up other job opportunities.

luxys3,gpabr4r,,I have seen similar posts from the van dweller community.  The conclusion: Don't tell anyone you are homeless.       I don't want to hear people's horrible judgement or ridicule.  I don't want to hear I need to work harder when I already work several jobs and barely sleep.   And I don't want to hear anyone's sympathy either.  I am an able bodied white guy so I would expect to receive ZERO sympathy (and I like it that way).      Most people are awful as it relates to homeless.  They are extreme.     One group hates the homeless and believe we are ALL lazy parisites (and drug attics) who do nothing and want us to die on the streets as quickly as possible because thats what we deserve.       The second group wants to save us and throw us in a shelter and thinks we just need more and more free clothes and free meals like new born babies.  They want to keep us in an infantile state forever to build up their own egos and view of reality.    The people who just treat the homeless like normal people who are going through rough times are pretty much otherwise good normal people are few and far between.  Its a balance of understanding and gentle encouragement that most homeless need.  Don't tell anyone you are homeless.     Not friends.    Not family.  No-one.
luxys3,gpazxzv,,In this economic climate where millions are jobless and merely an eviction notice away from losing it all.. i find it tragic people still dont have a heart or compassion nor realization it can be them or anyone at any moment.

Does your state offer any job assistance programs for the homeless? Sometimes they‚Äôre not freely advertised, you have to dig and make lots of phone calls lol
luxys3,gpaq6vb,,Great example of why I never let anyone know I am homeless around here. It sucks because being secretly homeless prevents you from being able to get a lot of different types of assistance. But I made the decision years ago. If it weren't for Covid, I wouldn't have even told anyone online. People make so many wrong assumptions about homeless people. They think that there are all these people, places and organizations to get help.  Not if you don't tell anyone, there aren't. So pros and cons, that is for sure.
luxys3,,gpbjrxf,There are resources specifically allocated for the homeless. You can't blame anybody for hiding you're a homeless person but expect to get help that are specifically for those people.
luxys3,,gpbmosj,Who blamed anyone? I said it was a choice.
luxys3,gpcdz0j,,I‚Äôm so sorry. No one deserves that! Try to relocate. I come from a huge family of uncaring subhumans. You got this. All people aren‚Äôt as evil like that. Stay strong. I wish I could do more.
luxys3,gp9ri3v,,Bumping into old "friends" was one of the cruelest aspects of my homeless experience. It didn't happen often, but fuck people can be mean. And then you try to rationalize it by saying "Well, I did used to tease that guy a bit in high school. We were friends, but sure I was sometimes mean and insensitive to them here and there, as friends." But then you realize, "Wait, if *they* are equating minor, typical teenage fuckwithary with my current homelessness, then clearly *they* are a morally bankrupt scumbag. There is NO comparison."  On the other hand, this helped me acknowledge that I was better off leaving my "old world" behind and I'm glad to be rid of all of those people.  And when I really think about it, if I was one of them and I heard that an old friend was homeless, I would definitely care. I'm positive that I would. And if it was a close friend, I would definitely help them. I would be ashamed to use that as an excuse to be cruel. And that's what makes me different from all of them. Fuck those people, I have nothing in common with them.
luxys3,gpahfae,,Yeah its a bitch askig friends for stuff. I dont mention being homeless anymore I just ask to take a shower here and there. I was bad at that at first, and it got so annoying so fast. You have to fight so much harder to get them to level with you. They always talk too. If youre dealing with something like this, be open about your situation. Not to make yourself vulnerable keep quiet what you need to keep quiet but just own up to it. I would move, but in between now Nd then get as much help as you can
luxys3,,gpbjbyb,> . I would move, but in between now Nd then get as much help as you can  This right here. Some people will treat you bad, most will make an effort to ignore and avoid you but there will be some that will do a lot to help you. Get as much help as you can and think a little bit longer term if you can too.  The people that will help you will be surprising too. People I never would have thought in a 100 years.  There used to be a guy around my area that would drop $100 on people. Never cash but instead a 3 month gym membership and a laundry service.  $100 got 3 months of  unlimited showers, sauna, hydromassage & weekly laundry. Think long-term bur use what ever opportunity presents itself here.                    I'm on the phone today myself trying to get 2 or 3 weeks rent assistance for the room I rent.  If I fail I am homeless again come Friday.
luxys3,,gpdg1ti,That guy sounds awesome. I'm sorry to hear about the rent situation, that must be really anxiety inducing. I'm scared of those situations bc of credit scores, im just sleeping in my car and floating air bnbs when I can until I can figure out how to get enough money monthly and keep it lol. I'm getting a lot better at saving money, so if I get a second job that should help. Not gonna lie, im getting kinda comfortable with living in my car. But with that being said, I want a place to shower every night and be naked. Also want plants and a cat
luxys3,,gpgssiy,> But with that being said, I want a place to shower every night and be naked. Also want plants and a cat  100%.  I miss having a cat so damn much but there is no way I would get one again for a long time.  I had to give up my girl Charlie about 5 years ago. I begged my sister and was so glad she took her in. My nephews love her too and she has a wonderful home but I cant go through that again. The only thing that made it bearable was that she is with my sister and I still get to see her a few times a year.                       Now for something really positive!!! I just got off the phone, my rent might be covered until I get back to work and get a check in a few weeks.   Not 100% and they are calling me back but they paid for 2 weeks rent last April when I was homeless and got me off the street and into a sober house. They were pleasantly surprised and very happy to hear that I am still in the same sober house and will have a year sober very soon thanks to them.
luxys3,gpaktyw,,Thats fu cked up. If that happen here I would help and keep it confidential. Sorry you have fu cked up towns people, sounds like you have a douche town
luxys3,gpbik2k,,Put your middle fingers up, and keep moving.  Bring up the point to them that they're snickering, is not only foolish but that it shows a deep lack of intelligence that they think they cannot be in the same position as you are. They certainly can and can happen to anyone.  If they're reluctant or judgmental, and they don't wish to provide you reference, thank them for their time, and move on. Don't let their ugly faces eat at you, don't let their nasty sneers get to you, and don't let the foolish harsh words be what you take as a lesson. Simply focus on your goals, keep aware of your situation, keep alert, and hope and realize that it will become better.  Even in these tough situations, and I did so myself when I was recently homeless for many months, it's always best to spread a positive vibe throughout the world. Such people are good opportunity to practice patience, to perfect patience, which as Shantideva says is something only the harsh can provide, not even our best friends can provide this benefit to us.  So, flip the equation on its head. Today, it's harsh, unwelcome, horrid. Can we decide to smile in the face of such things, to make it a game to see how many harsh people we can choose to smile to? Maybe tomorrow.  Yes, it will always suck, but this way one way I not only endured it but made it a factor for my own growth. Considering the pathetic merits of the people of this age, they will always look down on you, because they are self-absorbed and lack compassion. So, don't give into them, but don't give into anger and hopelessness either.   MettƒÅ(loving-kindness) and patience; these are the two factors those of us who are homeless should develop towards our aggressors.  Finally, the words of the Lord Buddha: https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.021x.than.html  "In the same way, monks, there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you: timely or untimely, true or false, affectionate or harsh, beneficial or unbeneficial, with a mind of good-will or with inner hate. Others may address you in a timely way or an untimely way. They may address you with what is true or what is false. They may address you in an affectionate way or a harsh way. They may address you in a beneficial way or an unbeneficial way. They may address you with a mind of good-will or with inner hate. In any event, you should train yourselves: 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare, with a mind of good will, and with no inner hate. We will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and, beginning with him, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will equal to space ‚Äî abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.' That's how you should train yourselves.  "Monks, even if bandits were to carve you up savagely, limb by limb, with a two-handled saw, he among you who let his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding. Even then you should train yourselves: 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic, with a mind of good will, and with no inner hate. We will keep pervading these people with an awareness imbued with good will and, beginning with them, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will ‚Äî abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.' That's how you should train yourselves.  "Monks, if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw, do you see any aspects of speech, slight or gross, that you could not endure?"  "No, lord."  "Then attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw. That will be for your long-term welfare & happiness."  May this be for your long-term welfare and happiness. May all beings, without exception, be happy at heart.
luxys3,gp9j63p,,You are correct. Majority of peeps are pathetic.
luxys3,gp9qg8m,,Maybe it‚Äôs not as bad as you think it is. Keep trying, it won‚Äôt matter in a couple weeks to anyone I‚Äôm sure. Just try and look your best when you go out. I find if I dress up in office clothes I feel better and trick ppl and myself into being more confident in situations like that. I kno that‚Äôs not easy for a lot of people who are living w little money or resources. But my point is maybe it‚Äôs not everyone or as bad as you think.

ltrxnp,gp21jql,,Sorry buddy. I also had a good friend from childhood ride a needle out, also likely on purpose. He was facing an almost certain 7 year prison sentence and I guess he just didn't feel up to it. To be fair, he'd already had a hell of a year. Motherfuckin benzos.  Good guy, smart guy. In a saner world he'd have had better choices. This was years ago now.  I was crushed, and to this day I remain sad for his family. But over the years, I don't know, I'm more okay with it. As tragic as it most certainly was... They didn't get him. They thought they had him for sure this time, like his 3rd charge in as many months, but naw dawg, he fuckin dipped. Wherever he went, he didn't spend a day in chains. I guess that was good enough for him. Peace, Ryan. Never met another quite like you.  I hope you're alright, OP. Cheers, bootlip. Better days to us all.

I should have heard about it from the commander.  The sad thing is that when someone killed themselves there would be a suicide prevention talk....however they didnt say the soldier's name.  It was like they didn't want to bring attention to it by naming him because they feared attention seekers would do likewise.    His name was Robin.  He had a Geo Tracker.  He was peaceloving and dated a belly dancer, no joke.  I wish I could ask him why he did it.  I wish I had known he was struggling.  We weren't close though, more like acquaintances.

lu76jr,,gpas5yp,Democrats have been trying to pass universal health care, expand Medicaid, or at least add a public option to the current system for years. Republicans are the reason this hasn't been done. When President Obama got the ACA passed, the republicans opposed it every step of the way, fought it in court, got the Medicaid expansion struck down and allowed states to "opt out" of that. So most of us stuck in the republican south have not had any healthcare as a result for years. The democratic governor here in NC has done everything he possibly can to get Medicaid expanded here. It is the insane republican state legislature that keeps opposing it and preventing it.

lsmkgg,gosc95b,,I sleep in a vehicle, and with the big freeze recently I tanked temperatures down to -9¬∞F/-23¬∞C. I remained fairly warm and comfortable. Part of this isn't just how many blankets you have ‚Äî it's what kind of blankets and sleeping gear you have. I was fortunate enough to be able to lay my hands on a cold weather sleeping bag rated down to 10¬∞F, and layered several more blankets and sleeping bags both above and below it. So you can get enough layers to keep out the cold. Of course, you have to be able to actually get the gear necessary, and while it's not very expensive, it can still be very difficult for people in our situation.  But your sleeping platform is going to affect this a lot too, and this is where sleeping in a vehicle can be a problem, especially if it's something like a car or a truck where you can't properly lay down. If you can get the seat to lay back, it will help a lot. Try sleeping in your passenger's seat instead of your driver's seat, is that will give you some more room to move and reposition without the steering wheel and pedals in the way. And make sure you put layers beneath you and not just above you.
lsmkgg,got8t3n,,I was in Chicago like 6 years ago during the winter and it‚Äôs not something to laugh about. Learning what to wear and where to go helped me. The wind chill will add more cold to whatever and wherever you are. Also remember if you are in a car or vehicle that the cold will go underneath your car as well.

If there isn't enough oxygen they won't light up or will shut off if the space you're in runs low on oxygen.  If it tips over, it will shut off.

lsmkgg,gosstt0,,If you can get a small motorcycle battery and a diesel heater for 100 you can get a tent or vehicle up to 80 degrees in sub zero temps.
lsmkgg,,got2hfe,Can you explain this more?
lsmkgg,,gotkf5z,So diesel heaters up until recently were for heating high end campers and sprinter vans. They were expensive. China came along and decided they would make cheap variations. You can find them on eBay and Amazon by searching "diesel heater". There is typically 6 and 8kw versions. 6kw for smaller cars and 8 for something larger. Both are the same cost for some reas or a few dollar difference. It's basically a small diesel motor. It looks like a box. You need a battery to start it. Once started a motor pulls air in from a tube over heated aluminum block which heats the air and then pushes out the hot air through another tube inside you tent or car. You would run it outside and run the tube into your shelter. It's cheap and runs for up to 10 hours at a time on a motorcycle battery and a 2 liter bottle w diesel fuel in it. No fumes like a propane heater to kill you in your sleep. Tons of info and tutorials on youtube.
lsmkgg,,gox9199,Do you have to charge thw motorcycle battery somehow every day or does it have something like an alternator?
lsmkgg,,goxgtgv,You will need to charge it up somehow. You can use a small solar panel or a battery tender , something like that. If you have a source of electricity you could use that too

Half of it.. 250,000 comes from federal government.   I can‚Äôt imagine how much the bigger shelters get  Homelessness is a big business and keeps people paid   I guess the only thing that would end homelessness is a collapse, war or divine intervention  Everything is about profit   Even when you die your organs are worth something in the black market.

They'll spend, maybe on the outside, $1,000 per homeless person and keep the rest. It's very profitable!

lsacax,,gprnm71,Would love to check out your essay as well. I am sure it will inspire more thoughts on my end.
lsacax,goxs1d1,,Top qual, so far ;)  I'm a gonna have to take a little more time to read it for real, and hopefully get back to you, tho.    I tried something like this too, not so long ago, and it already looks like you've done better than I did.
lsacax,,gprnpex,I would like to see what you have done. Always nice to understand other view points
lslr0a,gos6qe5,,Many current homeless are former soldiers.
lslr0a,gorynv1,,Oh yeah, they sure would. Unfortunately, a lot of homeless people aren't in great physical shape. Years of sleeping on the ground and getting exposed to everything under the sun does that after awhile..  Also, the folks who have been homeless for a couple years, might have other physiological or substance abuse issues that hold them back from committing to anything serious..so thats an issue, too.   The military requires a lot of discipline and self control, and that's just one thing that a lot of homeless people lack.
lslr0a,,gosjhh4,And we're old.
lslr0a,gosvcam,,So many of us are veterans. The military is more a cause of homelessness than a solution to it.
lslr0a,,govos18,Good answer.  Military service can actually multiply your problems. It isnt for everyone.  It's like marriage you might go in fine but end up worse off.
lslr0a,goshdv3,,Most homeless people would get denied.
lslr0a,gos4fgy,,Already got denied by a recruiter.
lslr0a,goswljb,,The military rejects people for all sorts of reasons, including having a rap sheet.  They don't just take anyone who walks through the door.
lslr0a,gotfqx4,,I used to be against the idea, until I moved to the south.  The number of people I"ve met that have been saved by joining the military is just, sad.   Seems like red states keep areas poor and stupid, so many young folk have no other option but to enlist.
lslr0a,gow1wkv,,At age 18 I was looking at homelessness or the military. I chose the military. It was the early 80s and we weren't at war with anyone. After Vietnam kicked our ass I think we were nowhere near as thirsty for war as we are now.   Obviously only a psychopath/Republican would be eager to sign up for a combat role and go overseas and shoot brown kids and bomb hospitals and so on. But what if you're going in to become a medic? Or a cook? There's the argument that you're still supporting the troops shooting and bombing kids. But then if you're paying taxes in the US at all you're supporting those who are shooting and bombing kids, even if it's through a lot of middlemen.
lslr0a,gosg744,,Just think about something before posting it. Think. Please.
lslr0a,gothpq5,,I tried, but warrants stopped me. Just couldn't pony up 200 bucks that i needed to survive.
lslr0a,gp1zpff,,Be better if a lot of homeless joined together and built some strong communitys somewhere away from society in a way and create a homestead and live FREE instead of being a murder puppet
lslr0a,,gp2yvru,like a commune?
lslr0a,,gp2zg1v,Yea sure, why not.  Like slab city only more homesteading, self reliant...gardening, raising meats and stuff. Clean water.....pool in together resources in kind and build homes from the deadfalls and what not..  Seems like it would be a good idea. Even have your own justice system "leo, judge system" Create your own barter...or maybe just do the whole community together thing....those who cause problems or don't work out...get out
lslr0a,,gp3fpeu,I‚Äôve heard of those, and from the videos from VICE on yt they seem fun to live in
lslr0a,,gp3g06k,Agreed I kinda wanna do it to be honest, even though I'm not homeless.  In certain areas of the states people do this...but alot of times there's no structure and it's more of a huge party....law enforcement end up being called...  Gotta run it professionally to succeed with it
lslr0a,gp7osdl,,A lot of homeless people have medical problems, including mental illness.  Do you think combat will do wonders for depression and bad backs/hips/knees?? How about society treats them with compassion instead if using them as cheap labor for the military.  Seriously.
lrm6gy,gon2rit,,> I'm still pumped.   I see what you did there.
lrm6gy,,gonevyh,It'll be a gas
lrm6gy,gomgh25,,That‚Äôs very very good news. Sometimes the unexpected happens
lrm6gy,,gomgjej,I can't believe it still.
lrm6gy,,gomgmqp,I wouldn‚Äôt either. Pinch yourself.
lrm6gy,gonuh1e,,That‚Äôs basically how I got my first job at BK. I went with a friend for moral support, filled an app out out of boredom, we both got asked to do an interview really quick, and both were hired 10 mins later. She quit after a month; I stayed 2.5 years lol.  Congrats on the job! I‚Äôm very happy for you, my friend!
lrm6gy,,gonwa1i,Thanks.
lrm6gy,gooia5w,,Get there at 2:45
lrm6gy,,iwkke73,15 mins is my policy with work too, I always leave half an hour before (takes me 10-15 minutes to get there)
lrm6gy,gon0noh,,Congratulations!! It‚Äôs awesome you walked in and made that opportunity happen! Hope the job works out great :) Take care!
lrm6gy,gon5qsk,,You deserve it. Congrats. Work hard and move up and eventually manage your own store. You'd have a story to tell by then.
lrm6gy,gonbhcs,,Oh wow, Congratulations! This is the start of amazing things for you. Knock 'em dead!
lrm6gy,gomiwdh,,Omg that's super cool. Does it get any easier? Lol  I'm happy for you and I'm hoping everything goes smoothly! Keep us updated and treat yourself with something special tonight..you deserve it

lrm6gy,gon4p8z,,congrats! super happy that worked out for you! go in every day and do your best. Keep the momentum going and remember that you are worthy of everything coming your way.    I read this[ article](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/04/ex-navy-seal-david-goggins-this-mentality-led-to-my-success.html) by David Goggins about working and hope it gives you at least a bit of inspiration.

lrm6gy,gonwcn9,,Woohoooo pumped
lrm6gy,gooiebo,,And stay 15 extra minutes
lrm6gy,gootubp,,Fukn unbelievable, make it count!! Well done mate
lrm6gy,gopgobo,,Congratulations!
lrm6gy,h02b5cw,,Not surprising. There‚Äôs a record number of available jobs right now and a record number of unemployed. So no one to fill them due to making more money on unemployment than a job would pay. Everyone suckling at the teet of big government money and don‚Äôt realize how unsustainable it is. Just by getting this job, you‚Äôre helping slow the destruction. Well done. üëè
lrm6gy,goowc6g,,In Alabama, where I now live, there is a saying- and people take it quite literally-it goes like this: *ten minutes early is 15min late*...   I've seen people, hell most of my guys do this, show up to work an hour an a ¬Ω early, sit in their cars and and when it's time for work get out and go...  It's just part of their routine...  I asked one guy why he does it, and he said it helps me wake up every morning...  But seriously, I shit you not, everybody in Alabama does this... I'll leave my house today at 04:45 to drive for an hour and 10min to get to the job site *(we're working in a Foundry today)* by 06:00, and my helper will have been there for at least a half an hour...   I wish you well, remember that the resorts are all hiring right now for the summer season and by March most of the "good jobs" will be gone... so you could do this retail gig to get you some cash to get out of town and het a job that will provide you with housing and meals...  r/roomandboard   Read the megathread you might find it helpful, I posted about this a few months ago to get everyone ready...  https://www.reddit.com/r/almosthomeless/comments/kk2acf/ysk_that_all_of_the_resort_jobs_this_next_season/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
lrm6gy,gp0djfo,,Way to go!
lrm6gy,gomsxj4,,If your going long term homeless, save up and buy a van.
lrm6gy,gonxt2z,,Cool. But do not get your hopes up too high  Get a few paychecks under your belt first.
lrm6gy,,goo23vr,Yeah I hope I can
lrm6gy,gqm48id,,Congrats
lrm6gy,gqq195z,,Awe yay congrats!!!! üéâüéâüéâ
lrm6gy,gomwz15,,Congrats but don‚Äôt be surprised when you see that the check is less than you thought it would be because of SSI, state tax withholdings, etc...
lrm6gy,,gomze4e,I hope he knows this if he‚Äôs beyond 15 years of age
lrm6gy,,gomzly2,Given the state of the American educational system he might not be aware of it even if he is older than 15
lrm6gy,,gon018y,Some states allow you to get jobs at 15
lrm6gy,,gon3gof,I know my first job at 15 was at the local movie theater.   The pay sucked, no medical or 401k and I usually got stuck with cleaning the bathrooms but on the flip side I got to see every movie for free that summer which was pretty sweet when your a young kid
lrm6gy,,gonm9hi,Oh yes you really get abused when your young but the percs of free food either at a restaurant or fast food or the movies thankfully there‚Äôs percs we find of our first jobs and that prob shah kept us going, when I first started out minimum wage was 5.50 but back in time of still being in school and no bills yet my 250-300 dollar, 40 hour cks was like a small fortune to broke me after being young & just getting an allowance from the pops or odd jobs around the neighborhood
lrm6gy,,gp21fnh,Back in $5.50 min wage, $250-300 had actual value. Instead of now with inflation constantly nipping everything on any earnings.
lrm6gy,,gp2xxx6,It did feel like it lasted longer then today‚Äôs standards
lrm6gy,,gp497lr,Yup. I agree.
lrm6gy,grw1afk,,Im so proud of you
lrh5nz,gom3bil,,A good deed is doing something without expecting anything in return. If you have to take photos and post them on your social media, it's not a good deed. You're doing that for yourself. Your own recognition.
lrh5nz,goll1vl,,welcome to the world of social media, where people want pats on the back to being nice
lrh5nz,gomv26b,,Its called Poverty Porn, same as these Youtubers doing nothing but cruising around filming the homeless or addicts. There is ONE channel on yt the man really give a lot of food, clothing, and essentials he will NOT take money. He was a former homeless addict and he speaks with people and is very nice.
lrh5nz,goml75h,,The best way to deal with people like this is to encourage others not to follow or share his posts because he‚Äôs likely doing it to build up a following and/or to capitalize on advertising
lrh5nz,,gommnpz,I don't think it's not enough to encourage others not to share an influencer's posts. The strategy should be calling out them out. I'm not suggesting to "cancel" them but definitely call them out. Advertisers are more likely to pull their dollars away.
lrh5nz,gomvdpv,,U know fuck. That guy but.. some days I could really use$20
lrh5nz,goo4w2v,,They say "feed the needy, don't feed your ego so leave your camera home"
lrh5nz,gooe30w,,I think it's just in such poor taste. I don't tell anybody but my husband when I help folks out because I would just feel slimy broadcasting all over social media and getting accolades from friends and family. I can't imagine that most people want to be photographed and be the subject of a "Look at me! Look at me helping the homeless!" post.
lrh5nz,gomb3wd,,I love in one of the pics there is a guy whith a four loko just vibing in the background
lrh5nz,gomaydh,,I agree, it's just disgusting that people would do nice things to look good. If only people could be humble about the good that we're all capable of doing.   If people are sincere about doing what's best for others, we wouldn't take pictures or tell people about it, it would be a secret.  I also find it refreshing that Jesus taught this during his ministry, this video called [Giving to the Poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPJKgt_zg-w) is all about what Jesus taught on secret giving to the needy.
lrh5nz,gowk140,,> So Brickle reached into his pocket, giving the day‚Äôs last bit of charity from his own wallet.   He finally reached into his own wallet 1 time after giving away everybody else's money. What a nice fellow. /s  This feels more like exploitation to me. Did those homeless people agree to be photographed?
lrh5nz,golx30c,,i charge 14 dollars and 25 cents per photo but only if they include my medical knee scooter in the pictures and don't ask before taking pics -,and they gotta listen to me moan about broken usb powered electric blankets and how racist people  stole my gloves
lrh5nz,,gon6niy,I thought you forgot about the gloves there for a second ha ha
lrh5nz,,gon6zhj,dem gloves that racist white man stole , lol ,i think of nothing else  shh .. u will blow my cover , there is 2 million dollar on me wanted alive or dead for the things i know
lrh5nz,,gotl79m,Lol I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre trying to be funny and impersonating a previous poster or are the same poster because all of those details sound familiar (medical scooter, racist people, gloves..)
lrh5nz,,gotlf0e,haha im just messing about .. here is that previous poster [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/lsv602/the\_homeless\_is\_being\_targeted\_by\_a\_group\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/lsv602/the_homeless_is_being_targeted_by_a_group_of/)  check there post history and you will see its the knee scooter person lol
lrh5nz,,gotm0ac,Lol oh! Okay that‚Äôs what I thought but couldn‚Äôt tell but I saw your post history and didn‚Äôt sound like you were the same person but your comment just seemed so real. Well played.
lrh5nz,,gotm3bg,Oh, wait she‚Äôs back? I saw that post and thought it was a little sus but didn‚Äôt check the history.   Edit: it‚Äôs the Sims Mobile that gives it away every time.
lrh5nz,,gotme5f,i didn't see any sims posts ,it was the harassed for being homeless type posts that gave it away for me ,and the other posts going on about racist people stealing her money  lol
lrh5nz,gon7z9v,,Lol op you are entitled scum
lrh5nz,gon87l7,,What do you guys think of "invisible people" yt Channel
lrh5nz,,goo52sv,With that it‚Äôs different. He ask their permission to interview, record, etc for a project that will open eyes to many who don‚Äôt realize how real and close to home homelessness is. It opens up eyes to see it can happen to anyone. Not just the stereotypes. This guy is giving money for pictures to gain likes.

lqgwky,goh3vtr,,Get a pair of cheap flip flops and enjoy!
lqgwky,gogckdf,,Or maybe exactly what you need to survive. Like finding a winning lottery ticket or a gold mine during Covid.
lqgwky,gogl6vp,,God I miss showers. It's been too cold to use the shower in my van, and the damage to the pool I use as the floor to the shower is too extensive to use it now anyway ‚Äî the water would just get everywhere. It's been months...
lqgwky,,gogroga,How much are those pools?
lqgwky,,gogvp1n,I don't remember? I bought it several years ago. It's just your standard issue inflatable kiddie pool. I laid it inside the middle entrance of the van like a liner, and I didn't inflate it. It worked pretty well as a waterproof liner for the shower.
lqgwky,,gogxv74,Those are among the many things I tried to make work last spring. Ended up being more trouble than they were worth because of the leaks, trying to dry them, carrying them and storing them. You name it and I've tried it......plastic bags, buckets, rags, microwaving cups of water, car wash hoses, swimming pools, the ocean, ......I just sent my most recent email to the city here again asking about the community center showers opening (which have been closed since last March). Nope.
lqgwky,,goh2i97,[deleted]
lqgwky,,goh3b9b,I had one of those in an off-grid dry cabin I was living in. Heated spring water in a stockpot on the woodstove, poured into the bag with the use of a funnel and hung the camp shower over the clawfoot tub that just had a working grey-water drain and no running water. Of course not much pressure but you can get soaped up and get your hair washed pretty well with one of these camp showers.
lqgwky,,goh3j8x,[deleted]
lqgwky,,goh508b,I use a modified 2 gallon pump sprayer shower system. It's very portable and gives good water pressure. The kiddie pool was just to catch the water that fell and diverted to the door well where it could drain out. You can get instructions on how to build it [here](https://youtu.be/OUMiuDwtZgw). I've been using it for about 4 years, ever since I lost hot water in the house, and it's transferred over well to living in the van.  I tried one of those bag showers before that too, and I absolutely hated it. Too much trouble, not enough benefit.

lqt5hp,,golcy6f,Read the article he bought a car and a home to work on and it says they are lifelong friends 4,000 engagement ring isn‚Äôt all that big of a deal  although it feels that way
lqt5hp,,golqtg6,The fact that a couple that can afford a $4000 ring became lifelong friends with a formerly homeless person...well, you don't see that every day. Sometimes upper-middle-class or wealthy people give money to the homeless or to homelessness organizations, but how many of us (including myself) ever fully engage with the homeless on a personal basis?
lqt5hp,goivnvm,,It‚Äôs real, I remember when it happened.
lqt5hp,gojmp1m,,Hopefully he spent it all on bitcoins and is now a crazy old billionaire.  But really, I truly think they staged it.  Like she had a lot of clout and probably seen him all the time.  She liked him, so set this up to get him some real help, not just some dimes and nickels.
lqt5hp,,gok0pei,A trio staged such a thing. A couple from NJ had hatched something like that with some dude. They got caught of course. Stupid people.
lqt5hp,,gok6k1o,I think on typical NJ people fashion the couple tried screwing the homeless guy out of his share and he went public. Pretty sure that's how it played out
lqt5hp,,gok83o9,Yeah. They had spent a lot of it, but they had given some to him, just not enough obviously. I suspect similar things happen everywhere though.
lqt5hp,,gokxut6,Im sure they do. you have to live there for a while to know what I mean
lqt5hp,,gojucam,Yeah...people stage these kinds of things all the time. Her ring fell off? I doubt it.
lqt5hp,gojk5ax,,I wonder what choices he made with the money and what he's up to now?
lqt5hp,golz92p,,If more people were as nice as this woman, I would have done the same thing as this man. If I was still homeless and I were in the same position as this man, I would have considered the ring a gift from the universe and sold it lol.
lqrvrp,goib3d3,,I live in San Jose, CA and they‚Äôre everywhere here. People get videos of them on their Ring doorbells all the time.
lqrvrp,,gojuzut,yeah, they know how to hide, blend in, and survive
lqrvrp,,gomnwcl,Yup. I think one reason we‚Äôre seeing so many of them in the city right now is because of all the wildfires and the lack of rain. When it‚Äôs really dry or big areas of forest are destroyed it drives the herbivores down from the mountains to find food. So of course the predators follow.
lqrvrp,goiozl2,,He might be hoping you‚Äôll drop food he could have
lqrvrp,gojcmo5,,I‚Äôve lived in Santa Cruz and Arizona. Heard a rabbit get eaten alive one night by a pack of them and I have a small dog so I gotta stay cautious. It‚Äôs amazing though I‚Äôve seen some about 3 yards away yelling to others at least a a half mile away. Their presence is very different from a domestic dog and I‚Äôm sure one could f*ck me up but thankfully they‚Äôre pretty cautious themselves.
lqrvrp,,gojuj9v,yeah, they are quick with big ass teeth
lqrvrp,gojvjlg,,I used to live in the country. A skunk would occasionally come out of the bushes and watch me work on my car. As long as I never moved she was fine. Last time I saw her she brought three babies by then I never saw her again.

lpcc9k,goaonry,,Sorry for the experience. Was it anyone here??? I would think not, just predators looking for desperate people.  Very low. But there will always be scum, so hold your head up high.
lpcc9k,,goaqktv,They don't actually post anything. They just picked me out of a handful of people here I assume.
lpcc9k,,goarrac,Block them and report if you want. Focus on the good people here.
lpcc9k,goaqqb4,,I'd suggest you to report them to mods, scum of the earth shouldnt be allowed anywhere
lpcc9k,,goar5w7,I don't think it would do anything. They use new accounts like 1 day old so I think they will probably just make a new one.
lpcc9k,,gob585e,I think the admins can block their IP. Please report them.
lpcc9k,,gobasdr,IP addresses are not an ID and are not static. The IP you have today may very well belong to your neighbor tomorrow. What the Reddit admins, not the sunreddit admins, can do if the person isn't careful enough is to check for the presents of cookies, or super-cookies, or cached pages, to see if the person can be identified as another known user. If they are careful enough to clear this stuff there are more invasive fingerprinting techniques that could potentially identify the machine, not the person. Some of those don't work on certain browsers or configurations, but if Reddit is determined it could be done as long as the same browser on the same machine is being used.   Bottom line is that IP banning generally just ends up banning random innocent people. There have even been cases of printers being accused of downloading copyrighted material.
lpcc9k,,gobaz12,Ah jeez, ok. I work vaguely in IT and thought somehow this was doable. I know our IPs change periodically but thought there was some unique identifier that was usable. Thanks for helping me learn.
lpcc9k,,gobbzfo,There's a mac address that is constant by default. But that doesn't mean I can't manually, or write a script, to change it to a random value anytime I want. Ip addresses are usable by law enforcement because law enforcement can obtain a warrant to get the identity of user of that IP address at a particular time from your ISP. But without that warrant issued by a judge it's essentially useless. But even then it merely IDs the customer, not the machine or individual using that customers internet. Which generally includes multiple members of a household. So for law enforcement another warrant is needed to confiscate those machines for inspection so they can identify the right individual, maybe.
lpcc9k,,goc7bsz,There was actually a court case about that awhile back IP addresses cannot be used to uniquely identify people.  Everyone on DHCP router (e.g. wireless router) has the same IP address to the outside world.  I think the court case was when they busted in some families door and arrested them for child porn when their neighboor was using their wireless router.
lpcc9k,,gobc5tv,In the case of the OP, do you think Reddit admins could ban most offenders, since many aren't tech savvy? Or is it just a ridiculous idea?
lpcc9k,,gobcsn6,Most offenders can usually be IDed when they attempt to create a new account and banned. But only because most users lack the technical sophistication to cover their tracks properly. Or their activity on the new account effectively associates them with a banned user. Some people modus operandi is unique enough to make it obvious. But a determined cheat can circumvent any ban, and even if they are later caught they are unlikely to be stopped during the account creation process. So they can have a limited time to do their thing even if banned shortly afterwards.
lpcc9k,,gock7rk,there is a rather robust user-ban system Reddit uses, how it works I think is a proprietary black box.  But when an admin checks the box to ban users who have been banned by other subs, then often a not sophisticated user will have all their new accounts deleted an hour or two after they create them. How it tracks them, I'm not sure, but I've witnessed it happen as a familiar troll keeps trying to claw back into a sub and their unames just keeping getting deleted.
lpcc9k,,goboj0x,You seem interesting. Do you want a new friend?
lpcc9k,,gobsqmv,I'm just a disabled old hermit, much older than you, living in a storage building that doesn't much care what other people think about how I look. I can still be mistaken for someone with social status if I groom a bit but I'm past the point where it means anything to me.
lpcc9k,,gocef26,Well odd that you mention but the same could be said about me.
lpcc9k,,goat7y5,Hm, true, well that sucks, all my strength to you ‚ô•Ô∏è
lpcc9k,gobzuu4,,I've received messages from sick men saying "hey, saw your post about being homeless..maybe I could help you." Well, by "help" they mean that maybe I can send them sexual photos and talk dirty to them.   Its sick and scum like that will have a special place in hell.
lpcc9k,,gobzys7,Yeah that seems to be the standard script
lpcc9k,,gochiju,I would call them out on it. OK, bud, send me $200 on my cash app and I'll send you a nice picture. If they'd send the $200, I'd find a "nice" picture of something to send them and say thank you for your donation.
lpcc9k,,gocqcqh,[deleted]
lpcc9k,,goj4o5d,Lol. I'd have to find one, but that's the best idea.
lpcc9k,,goia2rc,ü§¢ü§¢
lpcc9k,goav81p,,Been there. Homeless=slut to some guys. I'm so sorry you are dealing with that. It's the worst part of being a homeless woman for me. The pay for play offers are just insulting. Homeless women are targets, no matter what age. I've never been pimped so much in my life not even when I was 19, new to NYC and cute and I am nowhere near that age now...or that cute.... :P
lpcc9k,,goavhd5,I just have a lot to deal with already. Sure it would be nice to have someone just like up and buy me a car or something but let's be real I'll be lucky to just get a burger lol.
lpcc9k,,gob0je4,I had one inebriated guy on the subway literally tell me he was going to stalk me until I gave in. He was harassing me for an hour and I kept on saying NO as loud as I could but I could not get up and leave because he kept blocking me. I was about to get violent myself and kick the guy in the nuts if that was what it took to get away from his drunken ass but this big guy came over and did it for me. He picked him up and threw him off the train as the doors opened for the next stop yelling "The lady said NO!" That guy was totally my hero, grin...
lpcc9k,,gof40vu,Based hero
lpcc9k,,goi7izo,Need pepper spray. I got me one.
lpcc9k,,gob1ay6,Yeah they act like we owe them something
lpcc9k,goc55fv,,Men like this are beyond sad. They're too insecure to approach "normal" women, because they know no woman would ever willingly go with sad fucks like that and even if she did they know they won't have any power over her, so they have to look for the most vulnerable women they can find. They don't even want a woman, they want a toy that they have 100% control over. Go buy a plastic v at a sex shop or something. What the fuck.  Yeah. Don't even wanna count the amount of times this has happened to me. Disgusting. On the internet it's insulting, but when they start doing it irl as well..... Gross. The audacity. All they see is Vulnerable Woman. Not even woman though... Just an object to take advantage of. So demeaning. 98% of the times a male homeless person would go ignored, so always, ALWAYS ask yourself whether the guy is just worried about a Homeless Person, or "worried" about a Vulnerable Woman Who Is Alone To Possibly Take Advantage Of. Out of the 50+ men who offered me a place to sleep I only went home with like 2, and only because I was the one to start the conversation, not them. Any time they talk to me first I already know what time it is, no matter how "nice" they seem. 99/100 people won't even look at homeless men but we get talked to several times a day, go figure. As soon as you're homeless the real nasty comes out of them. And the most fucked up thing is, a lot of them would be normal colleagues or friends in another life, and you would never be able to tell. I don't trust most of them anymore. Boy does it get me mad.  Anyway. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. It's gross and demeaning. I hope you find a way out of your situation soon. And that these men stop bothering you. As if you don't already have enough problems to deal with.
lpcc9k,gob09dg,,I've had the same thing done multiple times. Any time I've posted about my current situation 9/10 the DM is some suspicious accounts offering money for services.   Its fucking degrading to be told that over and over. Somethings it makes me consider but then I remember how it could come back to  bite me.
lpcc9k,,gob1l9k,Yeah one person says I was trying to scam people lol. Like wtf I literally said I didn't want to exchange sex for money how am I scamming people just because I don't want to sell my body for a fucking cheese burger.
lpcc9k,,goba5dz,Oh yea. I've had full on rants when I rejected them. Them calling me pathetic and saying that if I want to be worth anything then I should sell myself. The worst are the ones who start nice then divert into being dicks.
lpcc9k,,goblydj,Mine didn't start nice lol
lpcc9k,,gocdqua,Honestly I rather know from the beginning that the DM is not worth it than when it starts nice and sincere because it hurts when it turns ugly
lpcc9k,goanzni,,Preach
lpcc9k,goaq934,,Being a woman on the internet sounds mad annoying and pretty gross lol.  I dunno what's up with dudes being so creepy, just block that shit like it's spam
lpcc9k,,gofqe19,Yes! It can also be annoying and gross with this stuff offline too, unfortunately. :/
lpcc9k,goboysc,,I‚Äôm rubbing my eyes and pinching the top of my nose for you. God. Barely a day goes by I don‚Äôt scream fuck the patriarchy or Men are trash. To be fair not all men are trash and some women are also trash. But holy fuck there is just no stopping them.    I run a non profit among many other things. DM me your details- only if you‚Äôre in the US- I can‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre in a different country. If you are in the US tell me what state, what city, what resources you‚Äôve already looked into that can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt help, if you have ANY even the smallest of disabilities (mental health issues including substance abuse count in this area too) if you have any dependents, pets, and assets. I can probably find a way to help.
lpcc9k,,gobqif8,Hey. Unfortunately I don't feel too comfortable sharing exact details online. I'm looking into resources near me every day. I probably have a legitimate disability but I don't have medical history to prove it. So actually getting a disability check is probably a waste of time/effort. Things I know is I have extreme social anxiety, depression, I'm in physical pain all the time and no one seems to know why or care at all. Like I said I haven't been to the hospital in years. But when I was a kid I was admitted to hospitals a lot for depression ect. They put me on medication for it but without insurance that became an unnecessary expense.
lpcc9k,goavp8m,,Sorry you have to deal with that.
lpcc9k,gob1rq1,,It is pretty depraved.  There's enough really depraved people that would do that without having to exploit homeless people.  Obviously whoever that was hasn't found them yet or it's just some stupid fetish they're trying to explore.
lpcc9k,goaxgrv,,I think a lot of women on the internet get this experience. I don't, I think it's because of my tone or something? But I'm aware that it happens a lot, and I do get random adds on Facebook, and I won't be surprised if it happens to me.   Reporting them will mean their task gets a tiny bit harder and the other messages they sent won't be available for follow through. Someone else might do it though.
lpcc9k,,goaxoqk,True.
lpcc9k,,goaxthg,Just realized: this is part of the reason I almost never put my face on my profiles. Pics of other things only.
lpcc9k,,goaxxmy,Yeah it's not fair.
lpcc9k,gpopjnw,,Umm..... How are you on Reddit then are you at a library or something?
lpcc9k,,gpoq42b,Let me get this straight, I made a post about how I don't want to be taken advantage of by creepy men and some how you got the idea that means I'm lying about being homeless because I use free wifi? Lol what the actual fuck.
lpcc9k,,gpot2rp,I'm not saying you're lying just how are you on Reddit then?
lpcc9k,,gpouli3,I use my phone and free wifi.
lpcc9k,,gpov9ai,How do you have a phone?
lpcc9k,,gpovsaq,Got it at dollar general for $10
lpcc9k,gob0vt8,,Its sickening you have to deal with people like this at your hardest point in life.
lpcc9k,goas3rv,,Being a sex worker is a hard and exhausting job. Being a woman in general is difficult, on the internet and in real life. Especially if you're in a vulnerable position. But as a girl homeless traveler for a couple years all over the country I've met other badass women who make it work on their own. There's also some badass men who actively protect others and put up with absolutely no nonsense. Find your people and stay vigilant. If you ever wanna talk to someone my inbox is open.
lpcc9k,,goas7gz,I wish I had people.
lpcc9k,,goasezm,Honestly being lonely out there and feeling like absolutely no one gave a shit or understood was one of the hardest things for me. But facebook has groups and there's r/traveler i think. Do you know who the 'dirty kids' are? Groups of people that hop trains and have hilariously bad face tattoos and haircuts. Generalizing of course but there are definitely pockets of awesome people out there.  Edit: i posted before i finished the comment. That's the wrong subreddit but there's a couple that a more active. r/vanlife i think and some others I could send you.  r/vagabond is a good one
lpcc9k,,goasuvt,Thanks.
lpcc9k,,goat7x4,No problem! You are not alone. Idk where you are but if you ever need pointers or tips or someone to talk to or come through my area and wanna meet up just send me a message. Stay strong lady! Survival can be fun if you find some people that change your perspective.
lpcc9k,god0vha,,It‚Äôs always insanely creepy and predatory! I‚Äôve only even made a single post on reddit but it got large enough to still get some super pervy guys in my dm‚Äôs.
lpcc9k,god947s,,Homelessness aside, our society operates on exploiting people with believe they need. Rent to own furniture,  pawn shops, and payday loans are a few that come to mind.   You are able to make a decision, yes you need housing, but not at the price of servitude. That is a good place to be in.   My guess is you would prefer employment, housing and dignity I hope you get there.
lpcc9k,godb1ts,,Sheesh.  I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  Good on you to call that garbage out.
lpcc9k,godqhun,,I am so sorry
lpcc9k,gocebw0,,I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about disability at this point. I was thinking about if a resource, Vocational Rehabilitation would help you. They‚Äôll pay people‚Äôs rent for up to three months sometimes.
lpcc9k,gocx5m0,,I would hate to be a woman in certain situations. I've never understood the "send me nudea" request considering there a literally billions of free pictures online. Maybe they get off to how perverted they sound, I find it extremely cringey. Once when we were homeless my wife and I were walking down a roaf when some dude gave us a ride, while in the car he petitioned me to sell my wife for 50 bucks. We bolted at the next red light. I hate the human race.)
lpcc9k,god489o,,If you don't feel its worth reporting them, take screen shots and post them /r/niceguys. Maybe a little public shaming will do the trick.
lpcc9k,god5rsi,,Hell, I‚Äôd send a few dick pics for a couple dollars lol
lpcc9k,godgma6,,I wish I could get money just for sending nudes, or have a home in exchange for sex. But Im a guy, and ugly so thats not an option for me. Literally like the easiest way to make money if you are pretty :(  But yeah just report them cause its not allowed on this sub.
lpcc9k,,godjqrn,You think it's easy because you don't see everything that goes into it. You think "just snap a couple pics and collect some money" But it's a lot more than that.  First off you are going to want to be in a private place obviously. But that's difficult to find especially now with covid as a lot of places just won't let you use a public restroom now.  You also want to look somewhat decent. Not an easy feat when you basically sleep in the dirt.  You also have to consider what the person likes, things like shaving ect.  And you want to have a joyful attitude, almost impossible when you're starving and really tired.  Then you go and do what the person wants and send it off. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!  Now that person has changed their mind and wants something completely different. So you think "I need to do this or I definitely won't get any money" So you go and do what they ask again still without being paid.  Well now they're happy about what they got and decide they want to keep it going. They ask you to do more and don't worry about getting paid they will be more than happy to pay you well for your time.  So now you are again doing stuff still without being paid a single penny. Maybe a few hours go by while you are sending out pics and getting to know the person. Until you start thinking you deserve to be paid because you are hungry after all. It shouldn't be a problem for the person to send you a few dollars just so you can eat right?  WRONG. Your new friend now starts getting upset because all you care about is money. They thought you were humble and they were going to pay you a lot but not now. Now you can just go dig food from a dumpster and maybe it will teach you humility.  So you wasted all that time and effort for what? Someone who was never going to pay you in the first place, just now you have more depression to go with it.  Don't get me wrong I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who are not like that. But far more people who are.  And guess what., that same person comes back tomorrow and wants more. Because you were so money hungry they should get it for free right? Logic.
lpcc9k,goazkmf,,I mean hey, sometimes women don‚Äôt mind. If you don‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt knock other people. Contrary to popular belief, some women see sex as a commodity and if a man agrees, they can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Someone isn‚Äôt suddenly a bad person to offer an exchange of services, and this is coming from someone who‚Äôs neither a woman nor a man who does/would do that type of thing.   It‚Äôs just straight up not an inherently evil thing.
lpcc9k,,goaztk7,Okay but after I said I'm not interested like 5 times? They just keep pushing like I owe them something just because I'm homeless and a female.
lpcc9k,,gob1md8,Well yeah, of course them being persistent is a problem. But if you look at your post with no bias, I‚Äôm sure even you‚Äôll admit there‚Äôs more shaming there than pure annoyance.
lpcc9k,,gob1ucx,So me publicly saying that I don't want to sell my body and not mentioning anyone is shaming them?
lpcc9k,,gob2bu6,If that‚Äôs all you had done, then no, but you‚Äôre summarizing it heavily.  This:  > I have enough problems in my life right now I'm not going to send you nudes for a few dollars. Get your shit together and go pay for porn if that's what you're looking for. Don't lurk around trying to take advantage of people who are in need   is purely shame toward men and women who participate in that. There‚Äôs 0 mention of persistence.
lpcc9k,,gob760c,There's also no names. It might be generalizing men but I don't really care.
lpcc9k,,gob7et4,Well then don‚Äôt be upset when they generalize *you* üòÇ
lpcc9k,,gob7ojx,You're not generalizing me, you're saying stuff trying to trigger me but it's not working.
lpcc9k,,gob7zny,Well first of all, I‚Äôm not talking about me, I‚Äôm talking about the men you‚Äôre referring to in this post. All *i‚Äôm* doing is pointing out to you that without mentioning that he kept asking you after you said no, the post comes off like you‚Äôre shaming people for trying to help someone out simply because you disagree with how they do it.  If that‚Äôs triggering to you then you should probably do some introspection. Doubly so if you don‚Äôt care about generalizing anyone, men included.
lpcc9k,,gob8gzo,I'm operating on fumes here dude. You can't expect me to be correct in everything I say. And I don't care how it comes off. I'm speaking my feelings if you don't like it leave the thread. Or just block me and never have to see me again. I'm not going to hold your hand and tip toe around your feelings.
lpcc9k,,gob2bl7,That's true, some do, usually out of desperation or to fund a habit, but you don't solicit it without any idea of whether or not the woman is actually the type to accept doing sex work and you certainly do not try to harass someone into doing it who says NO. It's one thing to answer an ad from someone asking for such work. Another to just assume ANY homeless woman might be into it if asked. That's unfortunately par for the course when you are female and homeless. Men assume you're just there to play for pay for the right price no matter what you say.   As someone who won't I find a man assuming and offering like homeless=hoe is just plain insulting. I had had more than one man argue when I said NO and keep asking sure that if he keeps throwing bigger offers at me sooner or later I will cave and give him what he wants. Even other homeless guys have offered me money for sex.  It's just bewildering because I in NO way invite that or dress in any way that a guy would get the idea that I am into sex work. I'm not a kid either. I'm old enough to be a teenager's mom so being asked that at my age is just plain ridiculous. But me being that old never seemed to stop it. I got offered housing many times in return for sex.  The fact that I am still in shelter isn't because I didn't have plenty of offers that way. It's seemingly part of life as a homeless woman. There's always someone there to take advantage, to get you hooked, to steal from you, to abuse you and get you working on your back. As desperate as things can get it takes real strength not to go there. I was desperate at times but I was never THAT desperate.
lpcc9k,,gob4v4h,>but you don't solicit it without any idea of whether or not the woman is actually the type to accept doing sex work   >It's one thing to answer an ad from someone asking for such work. Another to just assume ANY woman might be into it if asked.  How else are you going to find out? As long as you‚Äôre polite about it, I see 0 problems with it. LYou‚Äôre looking at it from the most negative place possible, when it could easily be someone super politely being straight up and asking them tactfully if they‚Äôd be open to an arrangement.  And any woman **might** be into if asked, **potentially**. Again, you won‚Äôt know if you don‚Äôt ask, and waiting to see if she‚Äôs going to offer benefits neither party.  >who says NO.   You and her have both said this. *Where* is that in the post? The post is largely about the act of messaging her about the specific subject, not that those people were persistent. If it *had* been, I never would‚Äôve commented.  > like homeless=hoe is just plain insulting.   And that‚Äôs both of your problem. **You‚Äôre** making that assumption. **He** doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel that way, and neither does every single woman. That‚Äôs your personal hang up, don‚Äôt put that on him. He‚Äôs literally just asking a question and it‚Äôs not even something that would universally be seen as disrespectful like he just randomly walked up to a perfectly normal stranger and asked. She‚Äôs homeless. He‚Äôs offering to help in exchange for something.   >I had had more than one man argue when I said NO and keep asking  Then that‚Äôs a **separate** situation. The persistence is what makes that a universally objectively bad thing, not the fact that he just asked. If she had wrote that he kept on after she said no, again, that‚Äôd be a completely different situation.  >It's just bewildering because I in NO way invite that or dress in any way that a guy would get the idea that I am into sex work.   What‚Äôs bewildering is you assuming it has anything to do with a woman ‚Äúinviting‚Äù it or not. He‚Äôs literally just offering to help her out for something in exchange. Because we view sex in America in such a puritanical way doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs any different than offering for her to do physical labor. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how you‚Äôre the type of person to use the term ‚Äúsex worker‚Äù but still view sex as such a personal, sacred thing. Like, why am I telling **you** this as a man, you should be telling *me* that.  >The fact that I am still in shelter isn't because I didn't have plenty of offers that way.  And that‚Äôs fine. But you taking those offers or not has nothing to do with whether that was a bad thing to offer. **You** view it as disrespectful, and that‚Äôs completely fine, but that doesn‚Äôt make it inherently so.
lpcc9k,,gob9fmn,It's not the same thing. You're trying to normalize sex work and make it not insulting to women period. I'm telling you a lot of women would find it insulting to be asked, period. If you want a sex worker answer an ad.  Go down to the street where the street hookers hang out and ask. Don't just ask a woman just because you know she's homeless and you "think" she might not mind.   That's not HELP. That's pimping and prostitution disguised as a hand out to help and don't think the women you are asking don't know the difference because they DO. They see right through that. The homeless women who do sex work usually have low self esteem, drug habits, and are very desperate. They may monetize themselves. They may even come to accept doing that as something that's just necessary but most of them won't like themselves for doing it and they won't like the men who take advantage of their desperation to get them doing sex work when they are down. When they get up, IF they get up they will be less likely to trust men at all. Because men have been trying to use their being in a vulnerable position to use them.   I am not down on all men. I rather like them as a gender but any man who knew me who suggested he pay me for sex would get firmly shot down and I would do my level best never see him again. Not because he hires sex workers per se but because he automatically put me into the category of potentially being one with no input from me.   Most men like that they assume that for the right price ANY woman can be had. You are ultimately just a piece of meat and whether you are a 5k a night call girl or a $10 hooker that's what you will always be in his eyes. A guy who is concerned about me, who genuinely cares about me is not going to make me into his personal prostitute.   Men have been monetizing sex for centuries. They think nothing of it and why should they? Some women do too, yes, but not there is a difference between actively seeking to be a sex worker and just being a woman, particularly a homeless woman, and coming across men feeling like they have the right to ask just cause, just in case, just assuming that maybe if they offer you something you might desperately need maybe you will sell them your body...  Choosing to openly sell your body is one thing, but this, what these men do to ANY woman it's just degrading. It's telling all women they are just meat and that they can be bought, for the right price and just so you don't think I'm just being sexist I feel the same way when it's young guys on the street being asked to be prostitutes just to eat.   Again it's not HELPING when you offer money for sex to someone who is hungry and at risk. It's PIMPING.
lpcc9k,,gobd24i,>You're trying to normalize sex work  Well...yes. This is kind of shocking actually, I‚Äôve never met a woman in modern times who was against normalizing sex work lol.  >I'm telling you a lot of women would find it insulting to be asked, period.   I mean that‚Äôs fine. ‚ÄúA lot‚Äù is not all or even most  >If you want a sex worker answer an ad.  Go down to the street where the street hookers hang out and ask. Don't just ask a woman just because you know she's homeless and you "think" she might not mind.  We just have to agree to disagree on how offensive that is then. I don‚Äôt think genuinely and politely asking if someone who needs help would be willing to do, well anything, in order to get that help is disrespectful. Because at the end of the day, you‚Äôve got someone who accepts actually receiving help and someone who rejects *possibly* being simply offended. That being the case, the scales are in heavily in favor of asking if you ask me.  >prostitution  Which is work  >disguised as a hand out   Well it‚Äôs not ‚Äúdisguised‚Äù as anything. ‚ÄúYou do this and I‚Äôll give you this in exchange‚Äù isn‚Äôt a disguise. And the times where guys lie about what‚Äôs going on is not what we‚Äôre discussing.   >don't think the women you are asking >don't know the difference because they DO.  They see right through that.   Then...theoretically there should be no problem correct?  >The homeless women who do sex work usually have low self esteem, drug habits, and are very desperate. They may monetize themselves. They may even come to accept doing that as something that's just necessary but most of them won't like themselves for doing it and they won't like the men who take advantage of their desperation to get them doing sex work when they are down.  Well I don‚Äôt like having to go to work everyday but you do what you have to do. It‚Äôs not abuse, women have agency (again, something you should be telling me, not the other way around). They can easily say no, which many of them do every single day.  >When they get up, IF they get up they will be less likely to trust men at all.   They‚Äôll be less likely to trust men because...men offered them goods in exchange for a service ?  >Because men have been trying to use their being in a vulnerable position to use them.  Well theoretically that would mean that these women would see men for what they really are. Which idk how being enlightened and more aware would be a bad thing.  >I am not down on all men. I rather like them as a gender but any man who knew me who suggested he pay me for sex would get firmly shot down and I would do my level best never see him again. Not because he hires sex workers per se but because he automatically put me into the category of potentially being one with no input from me.  You‚Äôre...taking the whole situation **way** too personally. And you‚Äôre also not ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than a woman who accepts that offer. Men offering you that aren‚Äôt putting you in any category. And if he is, it‚Äôs not one of respect vs. non-respect like it seems like you think it is. It‚Äôs one of whether she‚Äôs seems too prideful to be open to being helped or not. Feeling disrespected for simply being offered help *specifically when you‚Äôre already at the lowest point* means that you think **way** to highly of yourself. Like you‚Äôre above certain levels of help. No. You‚Äôre homeless. You‚Äôre at the bottom of the bottom, just like I am. And you need to internalize that. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with saying no. But you‚Äôre not ‚Äúabove‚Äù someone simply offering something to you.  >Most men like that they assume that for the right price ANY woman can be had.   Nope, *most* men like that don‚Äôt assume anything. They just feel like it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask.  >You are ultimately just a piece of meat and whether you are a 5k a night call girl or a $10 hooker that's what you will always be in his eyes.   So then just say no...  You‚Äôre taking this **so** seriously on a psychological level when it‚Äôs objectively not that serious. If you don‚Äôt want to give a guy that satisfaction, then just say no. But there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him asking.  >A guy who is concerned about me, who genuinely cares about me is not going to make me into his personal prostitute.  Why‚Äôre you assuming a guy who‚Äôs offering you money for sex genuinely cares about you? See what‚Äôs it‚Äôs starting to seem like is that you‚Äôre referring to times in your personal life where you were hurt that guys you thought saw you as more than a sex object started to treat you like one when you had nowhere to turn to, but that‚Äôs on you and them. That has nothing to do with the concept of a stranger purely offering someone money for sexual favors after announcing they‚Äôre homeless.  >men feeling like they have the right to ask  üôÑ Jesus Christ lady   #You are a human  You‚Äôre a human being, you‚Äôre an animal. You‚Äôre a regular person. You‚Äôre nothing special. When you wake up your breathe stinks, when you shit your shit stinks. Why do you feel like you‚Äôre so special and important that someone has to have ‚Äúthe right‚Äù to ask you something?? You know how arrogant and obnoxious that sounds? Get a fucking hold of yourself. You‚Äôre not a goddess, we‚Äôre all people. Lower your self worth to that of a human being.  >what these men do to ANY woman it's just degrading. It's telling all women they are just meat and that they can be bought, for the right price   They potentially can be! üòÜ like what are we talking about here lmao. Our disconnect seemingly comes from how you view people. You view them as like this...Disney, fairytale thing. We‚Äôre all just animals. We have rights yeah, but none of us are inherently above shit like simply being offered something. Not unless you‚Äôre a monarch or the celebrity equivalent of one. We can **all** fall on tough times, we **all** have the ability to do things we never thought we could in order to get through life. Your self worth is determined by how **you** view yourself, not by how some random guy who has photos of you or has sex with you views you.  >Again it's not HELPING   >It's PIMPING.  These are not mutually exclusive üòÜ! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to explain to you. It can be helping and not pimping, it can be helping *and* pimping, and it can not be helping and be pimping.   A person being helped isn‚Äôt determined by what the other person gets out of it. That‚Äôs not how the concept of help works. The only thing that determines whether something is helpful is what **you** get out of it.
lpcc9k,,goi6rwv,Nope. Not agreeing to disagree on this one. You don't get a pass on this on this one. For centuries men have been prostituting women in the guise of offering help. I call it what it is. Whether a woman chooses to do it or not and I mean fairly chooses to do it, not getting suckered or love bombed into it, is her call to make but only a small % of women in sex work have the agency to choose and work for themselves. so majority of the time it is women being used.   My heart bleeds for women who have to resort to that. It takes a toll on these women physically and mentally and wrecks their self esteem. I never said I felt I was better. But I could never go there myself. I am hard wired for monogamy and while I love roleplay and being a dominant and could easily act the part I could never stomach being a prostitute or mistress in reality. If I am not with a guy I love sex is not happening and for the record I do know the difference between infatuation or lust and love.  I have had multiple men try to head game me into the role of prostitute, mistress or trophy wife. When I was younger married men and pimps in particular used to chase me all the time. A couple of rich men offered to make me very comfortable if I would agree to marry them and make them happy, they didn't require love from me and didn't offer it. I turned them down.   Some women can't be bought and I am just one of them. You know that movie "Indecent Proposal?" I have been there and I turned the rich man down with no regrets. He was so stunned he chased me for a year after with a ring in his hand because he said I was a gem worth having. I didn't marry him though. I didn't love him and knew I never would and I wasn't into being some guy's treasured possession.   I don't think I am better than women in sex work but I do think I have better sense sometimes when it comes to not being suckered into doing things I might regret later. I know who I am and how I am and what my own personal standards of morality are. I have had men try to persuade me otherwise but I don't care and I don't fall for bullshit.   You can say what you want, insult me as you like and it won't matter a bit because my self image does not depend upon anyone's opinion. It actually took me a long time to learn to say "no" to people trying to use me in other ways. I was raised to be a caretaker type and to be the obliging employee. But being that way nearly killed me and I decided F- that a while back. Sexually speaking it's another thing entirely. any guy who disrespects or thinks to use me I'd drop kick him right into the curb and keep on walking. I have no time or tolerance for that.  Nuff said...
lpcc9k,,goic89s,>Nope. Not agreeing to disagree on this one. You don't get a pass on this on this one.  >Nuff said...  Please stop speaking like this. It‚Äôs way too meme-y and liberal/self righteous. Speak to me like a fellow human being that you simply disagree with. Nobody‚Äôs ‚Äúowning‚Äù anyone, nobody‚Äôs ‚Äúdunking‚Äù on anyone, we‚Äôre just two individuals having a conversation.  >For centuries men have been prostituting women in the guise of offering help. I call it what it is.   I literally just answered this. That‚Äôs not how help works. Help isn‚Äôt this altruistic thing where both parties get something moral from it lol. That‚Äôs not what the word means, that‚Äôs not what the concept of helping someone is about. If you need something, and someone is offering you that thing in exchange for something else, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily need that something else **from you in particular**, they‚Äôre helping you. Help isn‚Äôt predicated on the helper not getting anything from it or not having selfish motivations. That‚Äôs not the definition of the word.  >getting suckered or love bombed into it,   Again, a completely different concept and not what we‚Äôre discussing.  > but only a small % of women in sex work have the agency to choose and work for themselves. so majority of the time it is women being used.  If they‚Äôre not literally being sexually trafficked under threat of violence, they have the agency to choose. It‚Äôs literally a single word. Taking advantage of someone‚Äôs position doesn‚Äôt negate their agency. If no one is threatening you, you can walk away literally whenever you want. You would have to deal with the financial consequences of that, yes, but that‚Äôs how life works for literally everyone literally all the time. You walk away from your job, you get fired. Your boss isn‚Äôt ‚Äútaking away your agency‚Äù just because you‚Äôll lose your house if you quit and can no longer pay the bills. You can make the choice to leave just like you can make the choice to stay, women aren‚Äôt dolls that men just do whatever they want with, with no say in the matter.  >My heart bleeds for women who have to resort to that. It takes a toll on these women physically and mentally and wrecks their self esteem.  100% true. Also is irrelevant to the specifics of what we‚Äôre discussing.  >I never said I felt I was better. But I could never go there myself. I am hard wired for monogamy and while I love roleplay and being a dominant and could easily act the part I could never stomach being a prostitute or mistress in reality. If I am not with a guy I love sex is not happening and for the record I do know the difference between infatuation or lust and love.  Ok? Again, irrelevant. Stop with the virtue signaling. I‚Äôm not trying to be disrespectful here but nobody cares what you can and can‚Äôt stomach as an individual, that has nothing to do with what we‚Äôre talking about. This is what I mean when I say you‚Äôre too wrapped up in this emotionally. We‚Äôre having a debate, emotions have no place here.  >I have had multiple men try to head game me into the role of prostitute, mistress or trophy wife. When I was younger married men and pimps in particular used to chase me all the time. A couple of rich men offered to make me very comfortable if I would agree to marry them and make them happy, they didn't require love from me and didn't offer it. I turned them down.  *Sigh* third time in one comment.  >Some women can't be bought and I am just one of them. You know that movie "Indecent Proposal?" I have been there and I turned the rich man down with no regrets. He was so stunned he chased me for a year after with a ring in his hand because he said I was a gem worth having. I didn't marry him though. I didn't love him and knew I never would and I wasn't into being some guy's treasured possession.  Nope, 4th time, my bad.  >I don't think I am better than women in sex work but I do think I have better sense sometimes when it comes to not being suckered into doing things I might regret later. I know who I am and how I am and what my own personal standards of morality are. I have had men try to persuade me otherwise but I don't care and I don't fall for bullshit.  So wait...you mean to tell me 75% of this page of a comment is just you reiterating that you were in need of money and was offered it for sex but still turned it down? Lady, that‚Äôs fine but that has no baring on the concepts we‚Äôre discussing. If you just want to vent, that‚Äôs what posts are for.  >You can say what you want, insult me as you like and it won't matter a bit because my self image does not depend upon anyone's opinion.   That‚Äôs exactly what **I‚Äôm** telling **you**. But you want to keep talking to me about what men think about you and what men think about women who will sleep with them for money. Your self image isn‚Äôt dependent on anyone else‚Äôs opinion, or it is, but whichever one it is, *pick one*.  >It actually took me a long time to learn to say "no" to people trying to use me in other ways. I was raised to be a caretaker type and to be the obliging employee. But being that way nearly killed me and I decided F- that a while back. Sexually speaking it's another thing entirely. any guy who disrespects or thinks to use me I'd drop kick him right into the curb and keep on walking. I have no time or tolerance for that.  That‚Äôs great, I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you and your self confidence. But again, that has nothing to do with it being ok or not ok for a man to simply offer you money for sex.
lpcc9k,,goifdf1,üôÑ No offense but you are absolutely clueless when it comes to women and how they feel about this. All you want to hear is it's fine to insult a lot of women because your intention is pure. It's not and I am so done with this conversation. üëã
lpcc9k,,goiglgc,**Its not about you feel** üòÇüòÇüòÇ  Reality isn‚Äôt based on how you *feel*. I know exactly how women feel about this. And men feel that way too because the concept of being forced to do horrible shit you don‚Äôt want to because it‚Äôs your only option is genderless.  But that‚Äôs how you **feel**. And the **reality** of what we‚Äôre talking about is that something isn‚Äôt objectively an insult because you as individual feel like it is. Even if for arguments sake, we say it‚Äôs not the majority, there are still I‚Äôm sure **millions** of women, in this country alone, that don‚Äôt feel like that would be an insult if they previously publicly announced they were homeless, destitute, and needed money.  You‚Äôre talking about what I want, what **you** want is for someone to tell you that everyone thinks the way you do. And that‚Äôs just not the case. You literally can‚Äôt wrap your mind around saying ‚Äúthis is how I feel, but most people **may** not feel the same way I do about this‚Äù.  Get your head out of your own ass.
lpcc9k,,goiib8k,Did I not say I was DONE with this conversation? I am. TY
lpee4y,goca2tg,,Maybe just choose somebody in your local area, which isn't even listed. It is freezing in most areas right now.   A few homeless people around here used to find junk & bring the stuff to the flea market to make cash.  Scouting houses for a real estate "finders fee" is good too.  Street homeless people on foot know every vacant house and who's never in town after a while of *"walking the beat"*. (absentee owners)
lpee4y,goe12xe,,You might try posting on craigslist. I tried looking on craigslist for jobs and know other people who did, some homeless some not. Would not approach random homeless looking people on the street and make this offer to them. Good way to get taken advantage of. Before I got my job I would have been interested, I was super desperate for income. Ironically I actually got hired at Amazon after trying and failing so many times to get hired somewhere, and it's a really decent job. Wasn't anything like the things I heard about it on the internet and from friends. I don't have time to stand around wasting time on my phone or talking to my coworkers but I also don't feel like I'm "slaving away" either. It's just work. That also eliminates the opportunity for any kind of workplace harassment to happen because everyone is too busy working to even think about harassing anybody. And I'm getting paid $19 an hour for it. Not bad for my first job experience.
lpee4y,gob0cuz,,Great idea, but finding somebody reliable might be an issue.  I mean, it's not their fault, but they may not be in the same place from day to day.
lpee4y,godcsjm,,Also a 1994 great dane collectors plate. $23 shipped.
lpee4y,godk476,,I found the other gift card. It's a buffalo wild wings card with a balance of $4.05. I will ship it to the first response I get with a shipping address, and it will go out tomorrow with my other shipments
loni2z,go6zard,,ah wow 700 dollars worth of food  ,thats a right bonus ...enjoy
loni2z,,go707gs,Will do, thanks
loni2z,go7ebdm,,The awesome thing is here the local farmers market has some sort of program that matches up $10 worth of food you buy with food stamps so I essentially spend $10 of my EBT and just because I shop at the farmers market they give me an extra $10.      Really helps to stretch out that EBT in the summer and actually gives me a lot more motivation to eat local grown food, avoid any chemical laced or genetically modified garbage at the store, and it's pretty fun to find new ways to challenge myself to just buy raw food to avoid all that plastic packages.      Pretty sure it was a federal program so it might be available where you are at.
loni2z,,go7wl99,>Pretty sure it was a federal program so it might be available where you are at.  Same here (Virginia)
loni2z,go6zxed,,Awesome news.   You can buy a bottle of water, a pack of gum, candy, and things that you would not expect to with SNAP  And food items that double as toiletries, baking soda to brush your teeth, fresh lemon for cleaning your nails or washing your face or hair with the SNAP card. Olive oil is a  moisturizer. Coconut oil for hair. Dollar tree sells a jar for $1. Avocado is a good hand moisturizer.  Some prepared foods (like hot pizza at gas stations) are also covered, especially during COVID.
loni2z,,go70eyl,haha you can buy a lot more than that, but I understand what you're trying to say.  With that being said, I think I'd risk the $2 on a bottle of lotion and tube of tooth paste before I stated rubbing down with olive oil lol..
loni2z,,go779bh,instead of lotion u should get alcohol free aloe vera gel, u can get it cheap and it‚Äôs an amazing mosterizer, plus if u get a sun burn it offers great relief and helps it heal sm faster
loni2z,,go7avo0,Also corn starch or cocoa powder for dry shampoo and apple cider vinegar for deodorant.
loni2z,go9z1s4,,Food stamps really are a life saver. Personally if we didn't have them we'd either have to choose rent or food.
loni2z,go76ksd,,Wow!!!!
loni2z,go82fk0,,In my area single men of low income get 3 months if benefits every 3 years. When I was struggling worse than I am now I had to ask "Its bad now, but will there be worse times over 3 years?".  I never applied.
loni2z,,go860wy,There is an "abled bodied male" criteria here as well (20+ hours work/week after 3 months), but that's been waived due to the national state of emergency and higher unemployment rates.  But yes, that 'will i need it more some other time?' kept me from applying until covid came around.
loni2z,,gobzn9q,We have the same thing here but it's been "held off" because of the virus..I think after March I have to start proving that I'm employed or something..I'm just gonna wait until they stop coming and see what happens.
loni2z,go72knn,,Happens. For 8 months I got nothing because ‚Äústimulus ‚Äú or something. 1700 payout. Now 3 months without nothing.
loni2z,,gobzj1g,Sorry to hear that, things are really slow and backed up right now so hopefully soon you'll have it.
locufw,go7i2ke,,When an idea begins with "Some mysterious benefactor should come along and donate all the money necessary to make this interesting change happen that I just thought of"... I tend to tune out very quickly.  See... it is the culture of volunteering other people to do what we should do, that I have an issue with.  Granted, I live in a community of largely homeless people many of whom live in tents or pallet structures.  And the vast majority of these people are regularly saying things like "Someone needs to do this." or "Someone should open a place where I can be entertained." or "Someone should be giving me free stuff because I don't want to go and get it myself."... etc.  What is interesting, is that pretty much every unemployment office in the USA is connected to a system where people are offered job training... for free.  And... this system has been in place for decades.  At any rate, I really don't think you are seeing the scope of things here.  Ok.  So, you pull like 10 people out of homelessness and try to set them up with training to get them into better jobs.  What about the rest?  Just to give you an idea of the scope here... let's look at some older numbers (from like 2019).  New York city tops the list, with 90,000 homeless.  Los Angeles comes in second with about 60,000 homeless.  Seattle has around 14,000 homeless, and Las Vegas has about 6000 homeless.  That's four cities in the USA.  That's about 170,000 homeless.  Your idea took care of 10 of them.  What about the other 169,990 homeless left?  How exactly do you choose those 10, out of the thousands who want that opportunity... assuming that only a quarter are willing to even step away from their homeless situation to take advantage of that opportunity, we are still talking about coming up with some kind of lottery deal so those lucky 10 people can win the chance out of more than 40,000 people.  Thinking about turning that 10 into 100?  You've just increased the budget for your plan by a factor of 10, and you STILL are leaving thousands behind.  Ok... what about offering this to 1000 people?  Now your budget has been increased by a factor of 100, and you STILL are leaving thousands behind.  Now... what about all those people who are ALMOST homeless, but need a job?  Are they to be discriminated against, by being told that they cannot also be considered for this training, so they can AVOID becoming homeless?  Or do they first have to lose everything and end up on the streets, so they can then take a chance on this training lottery thing?  You can't get homeless people to leave cities that are buried in snow right now, so they could be homeless in places with better weather... how are you going to get them to go to where these training offerings are being made?  What is to stop people from becoming homeless ON PURPOSE, just to take advantage of this training deal, because it is a better offer than what they are currently facing?  And before you "poo poo" that idea because you think it sounds outrageous, sift through the posts here on Reddit, and you'll find a recent one from someone who was considering becoming homeless out of boredom and a lack of desire to continue to pay bills.  I look at pictures of the empty, rotting FEMA trailers that were trucked out and left behind by Katrina efforts, and I look around at the people in my community living in tents and pallet houses, and I can only shake my head.  The money has already been spent, and the equipment has already been purchased to be able to improve the quality of life for hundreds of homeless people where I am, yet none of us here will ever see a single dime, or a single piece of that hardware.  Let me repeat.  The money was already spent.  It doesn't need to be sought after, or wait for some mysterious benefactor to donate... the money was allocated, and spent.  And the equipment was purchased, hauled off, improperly handled, and allowed to rot and disintegrate without EVER BEING USED... instead of it being distributed to where it has always been needed.  (EDIT: And speaking of FEMA... why isn't our national homeless issue considered a Federal Emergency, so then FEMA could be tasked to combat it?)  So... I don't believe it is a matter of creating YET ANOTHER system.  I believe it is a matter of revamping OUR EXISTING systems, clearing out many of the people in charge who decide where and how this money gets spent, and altering the way we treat and "reward" those in charge.  Here is an idea.  It would create jobs too.  What if every Senator and Representative in the USA, both at the state and federal levels, were restricted to living according to the standards set by their poorest constituents?  What if oversight committees (creating jobs here) were set up to monitor and ensure that these representatives were living according to these rules?  I think you'd see homeless problems pretty much vanish, when every senator and rep from California had to be homeless and living on SNAP benefits, while there were still homeless people living on SNAP benefits in California.  You'd see Adult Foster Home programs pop up, where people could supplement their incomes by taking in a homeless adult.  You'd see abandoned property that was in receivership get turned into dormitory style housing situations.  You'd see money start to get shifted away from the Military Industrial Complex and into a Social Responsibility Complex.
locufw,,gojbphd,Don't really need the education on business.   The attitude you stated is IMOP very republican, cold hearted, selfish and self focused.   Personally, thanks to Rosa Parks and the numerous heroes we've learned doing nothing, gets you nothing and the all change, all growth, all improvements starts with a single person.   Everything in this world, including yourself, starts with a thought, a decision and a choice.   To me, you are making the choice to remain selfishly ignorant. I rather not but your opinion is equally valued despite the motivations behind it
locufw,,gojdlhl,I brought up a number of good points, indicating where your plan had flaws and would be potentially abused... and instead of actually refuting anything I brought up, you mislabel me as "republican, cold hearted, selfish and self-focused".  You don't actually SAY anything about how I am these things.  You just throw names out at me.  And when the homeless problem is over 170,000 in just four cities in the USA, and you promote a plan to help 10 of them... it does indeed seem that you NEED an education in business.  You might not WANT an education in business... but you might be confusing wants and needs.  Never once did I advocate doing nothing.. so your Rosa Parks speech is just a Straw Man argument, irrelevant and only present to try to drum up support.  In point of fact, I handed out two ideas... tasking FEMA to address the situation, and altering the way we handle Senators and House of Representative members.  Whether or not you believe these ideas are not valid is also irrelevant, because I was most certainly advocating activity.  I am not surprised that you only see things where if I didn't agree with you, I must want to do nothing.  When I present a lot of information, and an alternate view point to your idea... I am presenting you with information.  YOU are the one who specifically stated that you didn't need the education.  YOU are the one choosing to remain ignorant... and you are Projecting that on me.  I actually take the time to think about what you presented, and I break down where I believe attention should be paid to the idea... proving irrefutably that I read your proposal, I thought about it, and I attempted to discuss it with you.  Your concept is so weak, that apparently it can't stand being examined more closely... rather than continue the discourse to shore up your concept, you revert to name calling, misdirection, redirection, and otherwise nothing of substance.  Interesting...
locufw,,goqele0,Hey, I want to apologize. But first I want to apologize for not being able to give this the attention and thought I should have.  I haven‚Äôt really been able to read/consider your response. I promise I will, I am interested in your thoughts, input and feedback. I will revisit this. It‚Äôs actually very important to me.   I really chose a bad time to present that question/discussion. I realized I am not in the right mind frame right now and it would have been smarter for me to have set it aside until I am in a better frame to have an in-depth discussion. Things are very tense for me right now. I don‚Äôt remember what or how I responded but I know it was probably dismissive and emotionally reactive and inappropriate.  I am really sorry.   Most of the time (when I am not a basket case lmao) I appreciate all input and feedback. In planning to overcome/improve/change a situation/circumstance, it‚Äôs more productive to focus on the issues and hurdles, which I think you presented fairly clearly and I brushed it off.  I take back what I‚Äôve said, thank you for challenging me in a very forward, patient and constructive way. I would love to come back and re-evaluate my responses when I can  take the time this deserves.
locufw,,gosnzk8,Hmm.  First...  > I don‚Äôt remember what or how I responded  ... this is text.  This is all text.   You can scroll back up through everything you've posted.  It isn't a matter of having to remember what you said or how you said it... Reddit remembers and it is all there.  However, this statement from you is just a way for you to step away from the responsibility of having typed and posted anything.  Second... this whole post is yours.  You started this discussion.  You, more than ANYONE who might post in this thread, are responsible here.  You have all the time in the world to read the responses you get to your posts, and to comment back to them in a thoughtful manner.  There is no countdown clock.  There is no penalty for not responding in XX minutes or days.  The only thing rushing you to respond (presumably without thinking) is your own set of desires.  Third... your apology doesn't carry much weight, when you then break things down so they aren't really your fault.  I mean... you talk about how the issue is important to you, but apparently not important enough to actually read the comments YOU RESPOND TO.  So, saying it is important just appears like you are paying lip service to the idea.  Your actions don't imply that you place ANY importance on the feedback you got.  You talk about how bad timing is to blame... but YOU picked the time to make your post, and YOU picked the time to respond to my comment... so the only one responsible for any bad timing, is you.  Bad timing is not responsible for anything here.  You also state that for whatever reason, you are not normally like this... that you were a "basket case" this time, but that this is not the norm.  I have no idea whether or not this is true, and frankly with this being the only evidence I have to work with, I'm not disposed to believe that this is NOT normal behavior for you.  In my experience, when people usually say "I'm not normally like this" or any variation thereof, they are normally like that.  They generally want to alter an impression with words, so their actions get overlooked.  Again.  There is no clock counting down the moments until you reply.  If you want to revisit this issue, that is on you.  If whether or not you revisit this issue the way you SAY you want to revisit this issue depends on my response... then that is just a form of manipulation.  Be the person you want to be.  Don't TALK about wanting to be the person you want to be.  Don't try to convince people that you WILL be the person you talk about wanting to be.  Actually be that person.
locufw,,gotj73u,Ignore Bongart's vitriol. His attitude is of self righteousness and won't amount to any positive change in this world. I like your idea and intentions, it's a noble pursuit. I myself am evaluating a similar idea where I do have the funds. It comes down to several factors. 1) Is giving money as basic income more likely to help change someone's homeless status? 2) How sustainable is basic income and how can there be a stable source of funds? 3) Assuming you want to help those who are seeking jobs, will your jobs be openly  accepted? 4) Can there be a organization structure that is lean and profitable but focused entirely on helping the homeless? 5) Is it scaleable and easily replicated across communities, urban and rural? 6) Is your solution a permanent one or a transition so that people can reintegrate into their ideal jobs? 7) Is shelter offered with the job? Lots to consider. Helping 10 at a time is still helping. If you can scale it to 100, 1000, 10000 - even better. Good luck.
locufw,,goxkiyd,Hey Bongart.  Let me apologize on her behalf.  She really is going through it right now.  If my word as a hobo holds any weight, She's a good person, and really didn't mean any of it.  When people are having a difficult time, we say things we don't mean.  And look back and find it too difficult to find the words to correct our mistakes.  I hope this helps.
locufw,,gpcct8t,> We say things we don't mean.  I don't.  I'm responsible for every word that leaves my brain, be it words I say, or words I type.  Saying stuff like that all inclusive "We say things"... no.  YOU say things you don't mean.  You are the only person you can speak for.  Good person... what does that have to do with anything?  Don't pull a straw man argument out on me.  I never said nor implied anyone wasn't a good person.
locufw,,gq1fkb1,That was very sweet, thank you. But he is actually right. He has made some well thought out responses. I encourage people to speak out and challenge, as long as it's respectful. True growth happens when someone is knocked down but refuses to give up despite doubt or challenges.   I really appreciate your defense though.
locufw,,gq1eodv,Sorry it's taken so long, I wanted to respond with more clarity. To explain the situation, I tend to miss a lot of context due to severe double vision and a recent brain injure. I tend to use text to speech but without the reflections and emotions if conversations it can mask the actual point.  I finally was able to read through your first response and it's definitely more clear. I referenced being a republican because your opinion came across (at the time) as do nothing, it's their fault, there‚Äôs help if anyone truly wants it, let them rot.  I do see your point, I don't agree with some if it.  If a new drug came out that could cure childhood cancer but it was only effective against a small number of certain cancers, should we not treat anyone because it doesn't help everyone?  I don't think so. To you. Helping 10 people that could branch out to 1,00 and even grow to help 10,000 or more, (imho) is absolutely worthwhile. Even if it only helped the original 10.  I highly doubt you'd turn down $100,000 because your friends weren't getting it.   As with any business there will be hurdles, road blocks and brick walls but majority if challenges have answers, it's just a matter of finding and applying it.   Like your senator idea. I think that's bloody brilliant and could very well be worked into a plan of action. You just have to convince the people above them.  I've forever felt homelessness was more a sign of prejudice, not money. The government has proven that without a doubt by printing trillions of $$ to fight against the income crisis.   I do really appreciate you challenging my ideas/theories. The best ideas, businesses inventions, scientific study were born out of conflict and not praise. Assuming success is the biggest mistake in any opportunity.   Can you detail what you think the best way to fight against homelessness?    About the business aspect of it, I am very strong in working out deals, and barterring. I am certain I can pool the resources for free or next to nothing.   Keep challenging.
locufw,,gq6jz40,> If a new drug came out that could cure childhood cancer but it was only effective against a small number of certain cancers, should we not treat anyone because it doesn't help everyone?  Not the same situation, and thus, not relevant to the discussion.  Unless, you want to rephrase it.  To put what you said in the proper context, it would go something like this.  What if a new cancer drug came out (aka your plan), and it cured only a fraction of the cancers that an existing drug (aka the existing job training that is available to homeless and low income across the USA) would cure, but it would require spending an inordinate amount of money to implement this new cure?  Again... new drug, fewer people cured, could have used the existing drug to cure more people, with less time spent implementing said new drug into the public.  THAT would be more accurate considering the context of the conversation.  Both drugs cure the same cancers, the drug already in place cures more.  AKA more people are currently being trained by the existing system, than will be trained by your proposed system.  > I highly doubt you'd turn down $100,000 because your friends weren't getting it.  Irrelevant.  No mention at all of money just being given out to people for whatever reason.  Where would this $100,000 come from... the mystery benefactor just waiting to give money away?  > I referenced being a republican because your opinion came across (at the time) as do nothing  Incorrect.  My opinion was the same both times that you read it.  It did not "come across" one way the first time, and then "come across" a different way the second time.  You misunderstood me the first time and lashed out with insults.  By saying that I "came across" one way the first time you read it, puts the responsibility on ME, as opposed to you accepting the responsibility of misunderstanding me the first time you read it.  There is nothing of "I was wrong when I read and responded to you the first time" in your statement, and there should be.  > As with any business there will be hurdles, road blocks and brick walls  Yet when I point out these hurdles, road blocks, and brick walls, you responded extremely poorly... thus, it is evident that you don't want to HEAR about the hurdles, road blocks, and brick walls that you say are inevitable.  > majority if challenges have answers, it's just a matter of finding and applying it.  ... and the way uncover those solutions to said challenges is to hash out and debate these ideas... which I attempted to do, and you only turned around and tried to shut me down... as opposed to identifying the challenges to your plan and identifying those solutions.  Your plan requires Magical Mystery Money to just appear and solve the problems for you.  Your plan operates on too small of a scale, to attack the problem at its current size, and would take far too long to assist all those in need.  Your plan ignores existing assistance, and instead of attempting to repair the methods of assistance that are in place you seek to add yet another system... which would likely have to take money from the same place the existing systems get their money.  And... eliminating any existing assistance plan already in place in favor of redirecting money to your plan would CEASE to help those already getting assistance.  > Can you detail what you think the best way to fight against homelessness?  It isn't my place to come up with an alternative plan to yours, or for that matter, to start dreaming up what the best ways to fight against homelessness are.  However, homelessness has MULTIPLE varied causes.  There is no one single thing that caused everyone who is homeless to become homeless.  How does your plan help the homeless who cannot work due to a physical injury?  How does your plan help the homeless who cannot work due to a mental issue?  How does your plan help the homeless who already have jobs, but cannot afford to live where they work?  How does your plan help the homeless that are in places where there is already high unemployment and heavy competition for jobs among the people who have somewhere to live?  If your plan creates jobs for homeless people, doesn't that ignore the people who have somewhere to live but ALSO need a job?  It would seem that homelessness and unemployment are two SEPARATE problems.  Now, they have found that many times when they give a homeless AND unemployed person a place to live... that a job follows soon after.  They have also tried a more socialist program in California for two years, where a large group of people were given $500 a month free and clear... and they found that these people were able to improve their lives and situations, including bettering their housing situations and employment situations.  Again... EXISTING programs involving Tiny House projects, and Basic Guaranteed Income projects.  At any rate, WE are the people above the politicians who decide which programs get funding, and which programs do not.  WE are the people above the politicians who we would be pushing into new ways of living to better represent their constituents.  We need to REPLACE those politicians who oppose improving the population in favor of making things better for those who paid for their campaigns.  ... not create YET ANOTHER program that can be implemented, abused, and left to rot in the list of federal programs that don't get the attention they should.  > About the business aspect of it, I am very strong in working out deals, and barterring. I am certain I can pool the resources for free or next to nothing.  I see no evidence of this claim in either your initial proposal, nor any of your responses since.  However, if you are indeed good at working out deals and bartering, then I wish you all the best in making your dream into a reality.
locufw,go9sv30,,If you happened to have a million $ saround, pass me 100k. I'll spend it directly on what benefits me. Less hassle for you, eh? :P
locufw,,gp90rjo,What would you spend it on?
locufw,,gpz5of8,Living expenses(food, gear, books, cheap phone games), stretched to accommodate me in relative comfort for the next 80 or so years.
locufw,,gq18rvb,I think living on a $100k wouldn't take you very far. It seem like a lot but damn it goes quick. If you want a job that Earns (net) a year, let's talk. If you're willing to put in the effort, is certainly be willing to provide support until your self sufficient. I am talking about a CDL/ long haul. Let me know. Also take a look at hotshot. More money, less work but you need a heavy duty pick up and hauler. You could get those for under 100k.
locufw,,gq1fwlj,Our standards of living/comfort levels are likely quite different. I know my expenses. 1-2k a year is plenty of money. I'll stick to working 2 to 6 weeks a year at dead end jobs and keep the perks of my current lifestyle. I am aware I'm probably an outlier in a lot of ways though.
locufw,,gq1ga8l,Wow!  Could you detail your plan?  I can't even conceptualize living on 1-2k a year. I can't even live on that a month!
locufw,,gq1hiek,2$ of food a day average. Sleep outside, often in legal grey area. Make do with less. Take care of yourself instead of healthcare. Also, I'm unmarried, have no disabilities, and have no kids, which is a big factor. It's certainly not something I think is for everyone. I also acknowledge that my 'plan' may need to change as I get older. In many ways the 'roughing it' life is a young persons game. Im 30 years old and have been below poverty line/houseless to one degree or another for most of adulthood, for reference.
locufw,,gqlq5p4,Hmmm you have a very interesting perspective. Is that the lifestyle that is best for you or is it the bottom line you‚Äôre willing to accept?    I‚Äôve never been homeless but my fianc√© was and he had so many horror stories of what he had to do to survive.   But if it‚Äôs what you‚Äôre comfortable with, I could actually see the benefit. In fact, if you invested wisely, you could probably live off the interest.   There tends to be a lot of debate about you have to have money to make money. While, that may not be 100% fact, it‚Äôs certainly easier to make money if you have money.   100K can be used in literally hundreds of ways to create wealth. Just one super easy example, take 60% and invest it in a specialized drone, put up some free ads online, get some free business cards and you could make back your investment in 6 months. Depending on where you are you may have to get permits and licenses for the drone. Or start smaller invest under $1000 for a decent drone and market yourself out to Realtors to make Ariel/ fly through ads for their properties. Invest in a higher quality drone and make mega bucks offering yourself to higher scale real estate companies and vacation rentals. Check out Southbys.   There are a ton of way and opportunities to turn even 100,000 into millions and many mentors to help you out. Let‚Äôs keep in touch.
locufw,,gqrgqai,Best or bottom line is something I wonder about occasionally. I've enjoyed being roommates with select people. That would cost a bit more of course. I can take or leave it tho. All situations come with downsides, regardless of income or circumstance, I suppose. I'm unsure whether, if I had 100k or a million dollars suddenly, wether I could actually ration it for my lifespan or if it would be like lottery winners, where it all gets spent within a few years and they return to 'the usual.' I'm not confident that I have superhuman self control so... Maybe hang on to those $$$. üòâ

lntv99,go2jrzv,,Stay warm and remember that when you go to sleep, less is more when it comes to clothing. Unless the conditions are extremely perilous and assuming your feet are covered by a sleeping bag/blanket, don't wear your shoes or other constrictive clothing (jacket buttoned/zipped up); this is poor for circulation and can be counter-intuitive. Check out any form of long johns (silk pref, but they shrink and are expensive) however be careful of cotton, I think polyblends are the most affordable and you could find them goodwill/donation centers.   If I wasn't depending on a fast food job and my folks I'd offer you a nice sleeping bag that's good to -10 iirc and a pup tent if you don't have one. Where are you located at?  edit: I don't know your situation, but to anyone who is in the thick of it, tarps are your best friend. Cheap, versatile and reliable. I've never been homeless, but I'm on the edge of it, but I've done some makeshift camping with some tarps, sticks and bungie cords. Those with a decent sleeping bag, you can make it thru most nights.
lntv99,,go2uz08,Ja i sleep in just thermal underwear since my sleeping bag is usually overkill i sleep comfortably in around 10¬∞f
lntv99,,go2rz21,I hate silk, personally. I have two types, the thicker stuff and the hosiery style, neither seem to keep me warm or dry, in fact I prefer godawful cotton to silk because it doesn't make me wake up with sweaty wet spots in the middle of the night... as often, anyway. Wool is king in my experience, with thick synthetic a distant second. I had money to burn a couple years ago, so I tried every material I could find to test them out. I still have the silk sets but consider them daytime only. Comfy, if indoors or when moving about at an easy pace that doesn't make me sweat from the work. The only type I never tried was the wool with low silk blends... $250 a set and three months shipping at the time from a shady amazon seller, so didn't get the chance. Woulda loved to test those out.
lntv99,,go8zuy7,Thick synthetic is my go to, since it‚Äôs about half as expensive as wool and 80% as good.

lnb1kv,,go0k54s,Capitalism is usually the meaning that people live their lives according to.

lnb1kv,,go15u3k,Death itself has no meaning either. Because there‚Äôs no reward at the end of life so I don‚Äôt see meaning in death. It‚Äôs just all about live in the moment.
lnb1kv,,go1avi1,The meaning they are enslaved by. The carrot on the stick dangled in front of everyones nose to get them to conform to ambition, goals and success.  Meaning the endless struggle for more money and stuff.   Earn, spend and consume. The ones capitalizing on that are the wealthy, the rest get debt and endless servitude.
lnb1kv,go0lr6o,,I agree completely. The struggle to survive another day, like an animal. No future, no hope. Everyone from your past abandons you. The people that have all say the same tired crap: it's mental illness, drug abuse. Bull! Anyone who loses everything and has to live on the streets becomes mentally ill! The PTSD is real. It's shocking to have nowhere to go, no routine. I have also given up. There have been days when I just find a doorway and lay there, not giving a damn about ever getting up again. I read the Bible; the book of Job. Job 10:1 "I loathe my very life...whar crime have I committed? Why do you curse me, a righteous man, yet smile on the endeavors of the wicked?" In the end, Job has one request of God: "Please stop torturing me, leave me alone!" I feel the same way.   I have no words of hope. I just wanted you to know that you are not alone in a life of despair. Good luck. In the final analysis that's all there is: luck.
lnb1kv,,go1ffah,I feel the Bible was written by the elite to control the masses. The ‚Äújob‚Äù story is just another cruel story out of the Bible.  This is not a God I would follow based on stories like that.
lnb1kv,,go1mcoa,Half of what the Christians call the Bible isn't Christian anyway. It's Jewish. All that stuff about Job and Deuternonomy etc., are the old Torah which for some reason the Christians adopted. In Jesus's own words, it doesn't apply, because he announced a "new covenant" the Christians just like the old Torah stuff because there's tons of rules and punishments and controlling.
lnb1kv,,go1o5yl,Too bad It was Jesus‚Äô job to fix his dads screw ups.
lnb1kv,,go1onw1,The whole thing is crazy. The idea of a god who has a covenent with one tribe or race is pretty self-serving right there. Then a lot of nonsensical events supposedly proving that one group is favored but I dunno, that god seems like a "frien-emy" to me. The whole thing is Q level coo-coo. Shinto makes more sense. Buddhism makes tons more sense.
lnb1kv,,go29yi6,I was just pointing out the absurdity of all of it. I get why down and out folks feel the need for the man in the sky.  I‚Äôm perplexed why otherwise well functioning people buy into it. Other than the whole reincarnation deal, there are somethings to be gained by following eastern philosophy.  I think it all comes down to attitude whatever situation a person finds  themselves in.
lnb1kv,,go32bgj,The branch of Buddhism I follow doesn't lean too heavily on the reincarnation thing. We talk occasionally about the realms of devas, of bodhisattvas, of humans, animals, and "hungry ghosts" but our teacher emphasizes that this is all happening at once.   I had a time when I was close to becoming street homeless. I had a little 250cc motorcycle to buzz around on, and was paying $20 a night to sleep on a couch. And I was riding along one day and thought to myself, this is my world. I was born here and my kind evolved here. I can breathe the air, drink the water, etc. This is my home. Therefore I should feel comfortable here. Even if I'm homeless, I am still home at the essential level.   That thinking, I think, takes away the essential insult. I think it's the same thinking as the street artist George Orwell met in "Down And Out In Paris And London", in London.   Panhandling, for a while anyway, was interesting. I could tell myself I was Studs Terkel on a quest to determine the state of the nation's spare change. One evening I ran into a guy I knew in Mountain View, Homeless Jeff. That's what he's known by. Nice guy. Goes on some horrible benders though. He told me that night that I'll need "strong faith" to deal with the mean people out there, and I said that actually since I'd gotten into panhandling my "faith in humanity" has gone up 1000X because I'd never realized how many nice people are out there. Yeah there are some mean ones. Met on really mean one. But that was it. And I was making $40-$50 a day which is what I do now. I only panhandled for 4-5 months which I think was enough. It was very interesting and educational.   I get what you mean about otherwise functional people believing in the Rapture and such things. It's just weird. Mountain View is a wealthy area yet there are these rabid Christians there and you have to be pretty high functioning to afford to live there. One time I was playing "Amazing Grace" on trumpet and one of 'em came up and got in my face and wanted to convert me or I dunno, so I started "jazzing it up" and it was like it was in insult and he said to stop doing that. I did not stop. It angered him enough that he left. Moral: You can never go wrong jazzing up Amazing Grace.
lnb1kv,go0ip9z,,Consider the meaning of a dance. Is it to get to the end of the dance? Or perhaps the meaning of purpose of music- is it to get to the end of the song? As fast as possible?   The meaning of the dance is in the dancing, just as the meaning of song is in every moment of singing, just as the meaning of life is in every second of living.   Living is lifes meaning. Do the things you enjoy. Learn from these experiences you're having. Focus on gratitude and drink deeply of the well. This way of thinking helped me a lot in my time of being on the street.
lnb1kv,,hif79v4,wow great advice. mindfuleness and being present with gratitude
lnb1kv,go0n1ji,,I thought the post was going to be about neurochemistry from the title.  I was homeless for about a year.  It was one of the most terrifying and hardest things I had to go through in this life.  I was very bitter and felt abandoned at the time but in retrospect, the experience taught me far more about myself than it did society and others.  One thing I saw was that my problems with society started with me.  I had attitudes and lived my life in ways that shut me off from the benefits of the companionship of others well before I was on the streets.  I felt I was strong enough to carve my own path and didn‚Äôt need anyone else.  It was when I was at my lowest that I saw this sole reliance on my own strength is what made me the weakest.  Life is about the meaning you find with and through others.
lnb1kv,go06qp1,,Yes he can. Viktor Frankl wrote "Men in Search of Meaning" about the subject of finding meaning in our bleakest hour. He was a prisoner in a concentration camp during WWII and he explores his psychological views on how we can face this challenge.    But it is hard, especially if you don't have a positive mindset to begin with. Dealing with the cruelty not only from those who look down on you from better standings but also having to deal with the violence from the ones you could build community like other homeless people...  It just scare me how, the last time I was homeless sometimes you met people who were so kind and helpful and almost in a second later you met someone who was willing to kill you or make your already miserable existence even worse for just a few bucks to get the next dose or just because he can.  Personally I don't think it really matters if there is a meaning to be found. I just try to focus in being alive and trying to survive with the least amount of pain and suffering as possible, but would gladly embrace death if there was a way to avoid the pain from the act of dying, because if life is meaningless so is death.

lnb1kv,go0ucg7,,Yes, if absurdity has any appeal for you.  Absurdism is the idea that you can, and perhaps should, acknowledge there is no serious meaning to life, the human condition is completely absurd, and yet somehow it still has its beauty and intrigue, thus value.  This doesn't work for some people, but it has been working for me.  Rather than search for meaning, always coming up short and constructing shaky foundations, embrace the meaninglessness and build your ethos from that foundation--which is rock solid.

lnb1kv,go0fm2k,,What are experiencing here is not what exists throughout the world. I lived in Asia for 11 years... in Singapore, you never see homeless people.  They give people experiencing homelessness in Singapore a opportunity to work and a place to live.    Singapore has a job placement program partnering with every company in Singapore to provide jobs to anybody who needs one....homeless people are matched to an employer based on their skill sets and ability.The government pays 75% of the wages and the company pays 25%...as most jobs are low wage.  Homeless people  have to pay for their government apartment...its not free. Singapore gives a hand up...not a handout.   That's why if you go to Burger King or McDonalds you will see lots of elderly or disabled workers.... they are earning their wages to pay for their government apartments. The government pays like 50% of the apartment. Poor people in Singapore have dignity and the right to a stable and safe life. Crime is almost non-existent.   Healthcare and  higher education is free in  Singapore.    And for those homeless who refuse to work for their government apartment...they are locked up in the Social Service Agency facility indefinitely  ...looks like a prison.   Im not saying America needs to be like Singapore .... but other countries got their act together when it comes to the poor and homelessness.
lnb1kv,,go0vbwv,>And for those homeless who refuse to  work for their government apartment...they are locked up in the Social  Service Agency facility indefinitely ...looks like a prison.  That's a pretty horrible trade off.  So if you can't meaningfully engage a work program, you're imprisoned -- even if you don't harm anyone, if you don't work, cages. YUCK!   I'm not going to say Singapore sucks because all I know is what you just said, but that's a highly uncivilized way to approach the problem, it makes the whole nation sounds like a work camp prison. I would honestly very much take our very horrible status quo in the  United States over a situation in which anyone who can't engage a work program is imprisoned, how horrible.  Many vulnerable adults -- due to disability, trauma, emotional/mental problems -- can not meaningfully engage a work program, they shouldn't lose all their human rights because of it, that's horrifically and tragically ableist.
lnb1kv,,go1jif4,From an American perspective..it looks terrible to lock people up. But that's what Singapore society wants.  Society has no problem with locking people up who refuse to work and  lay around all day as homeless , and get free money.   And yes,  those with mental and physical disabilities who cannot work ...who have no family to help them... they are locked away too. That's how society feels....if people cannot work for their independence...and the  government has to support them with tax payers money...they lose their right to live independently, but they will be cared for.  Singapore society is okay with that.   Singapore society also suppprts the death penalty for drug dealers and those caught with a decent amount of drugs.   Singapore society also supports locking people up who disparage people based on their race or criticism of government officials.   Singapore might not be the perfect place for many....but Singapore will provide housing, free health care, free education, free job training,  free vocational school, high standard of living, public safety and a job and people don't have to wait years for help...just a matter of days.. all in exchange for some loss of western freedoms. Singapore people are very happy with that arrangement.   Im now back to living in Los Angeles,  and it's a such a stark contrast from living in Singapore.  Its just sheer lawlessness and government incompetence in America...its shameful.

But the good thing is that you can choose what to focus on and what to bring more of. It takes time. We live in a time based reality where what we choose to focus on gathers energy and progress the more we focus on it. So remind yourself of that if you become discouraged with any seemingly lack of progress with your happiness/quality of life.  I've been homeless for 6 months (granted many have had longer) but the child abuse and mental illness I've endured was worse. When I became homeless and away from the home of my "parents" it was a breathe of fresh air in comparison. It's about perspective. You can train your perspective to change. Start with research. You and everyone else out there got this. Things will change eventually. Even when you're the most discouraged, you get tired of this at some point, and you do anything it takes to change. The state of your brain isnt permanent. There isnt anything to suggest this -just your own illusion of hopelessness.
lnb1kv,go2f4d8,,I feel you. What I've always believed is that the streets are a big catch-all. Finding yourself here is absolutely nothing about who you are except the one fact that we're all misfits for one reason or another. It's pretty common that the reason is that you're a big piece of shit that no decent people want around them, but can be any form that sets you apart from societies acceptable idea of normal. You can be gifted, amazingly gentle and kind, you name it but if it's accompanied by anything that differs from "nuerotypical" then you too get cast off as a misfit.  So that leaves us with a mix that ends up with the biggest population of worst people, the weirdest people, and unfortunately the decent and the amazingly unique people are forced together in the same population.   Tldr; the only requirement to be of the streets is that for one reason or another you are misunderstood. It does not discriminate why the reason is beyond that.
lnb1kv,go2gty3,,Thinking that I kinda went off topic on the last one. I'm a bit foggy today..  But yes indeed. I'll never be able to forget that these same happy friendly people all around are the same people that would sneer at my suffering and just as soon seen me disposed of with the rest of the refuse on trash day. How could anyone un-know that little fact, you can't.   Also I've developed obsessive habits as far as personal care and preparedness. I have to remind myself constantly that I don't have to shower like it's the last one I'll have in who knows, or pack my belongings like I'm expecting the world to end.   Yeah it definitely imprints a bit of trauma on you forever.
lnb1kv,,go2i7ad,Not at all, this is a really deep thing to understand. Being homeless or living in a slum area are things that can leave you with severe pstd for your entire life.  If like is a game being in those conditions is like playing in survivor mode you discover how fragile you are but at the same time. How fragile are other and how thin is the line holding our society to fall.  I wish we could speak more about this topic in our society but most of the time is a taboo even mentioning things as suicide or violence in the streets.
lnb1kv,go2hnin,,Honestly the only thing that's keeping me going at this point is the idea of at some point being in a position again to help people in the same situation...I had absolutely no idea prior to all of this how closely domestic violence and homelessness are linked...a quarter of all women experiencing homelessness are unhoused because of DV...the DV shelter in my city turns away three-quarters of all callers looking for emergency shelter...it's horrifying and literally the _only_ solution is more funding.
lnb1kv,,go2ik8d,I don't know I believe the unffair competition between middle income people and big corporations supported by tax money could be one of the causes of so much unemployed homeless people. Hope you get better and help some people.
lnb1kv,,go2jzze,Well obviously also applicable are all the socioeconomic conditions which contribute to the problem in the first place...that being a lack of affordable housing and insufficient employment resources (especially for individuals who are returning to the workforce after a long time, like many DV victims are) among many other problems.

ln5ay5,gnz4tpv,,Nice! I got a LifeWire unlimited sms and 5G calling free. Also online you can call and message from [textnow.com](https://textnow.com). Great service free. Good luck! A cheap set of Skull Candy earbuds are awesome for this site.

ln7145,gnzjbo4,,You don't have enough Karma to post in r/assistance to ask for money, to get your clothes from your old Roommate.  I don't know if you can get your Karma up fast enough to do any good... but it is still a thought.  You could fly a sign... especially if you don't have anything else to do, and you have nowhere to be.  It basically put you in a position where people hand you money for looking like you need it, while holding a sign that clarifies the point.  The less you look like a clean-cut individual, the greater the potential amount of money will be at the end of your "shift".  People in my community treat flying a sign as a job, pretty much.  You might be able to get some assistance from local churches (if you were or are a member at one)... but that would more than likely take the form of food/clothing/blankets, etc.  You can sign up for SNAP benefits, and at least get enough in food stamps to feed you every month (assuming you don't spend it like an idiot and blow through it in a week or two).  I know... you don't have an ID, because you don't have a wallet anymore.  However, at the social services office where you would sign up for SNAP... they actually have procedures in place to be able to GET you benefits, even without an ID.  AND... they have vouchers available that can get you another ID for free (especially if they put you in their system as "homeless").  Since you have access to the internet, you should be searching for the locations of all the homeless shelters in your area.  You should be visiting all of them to find a bed... and ALSO to spend time talking with the people who work at the shelters, to get some specific and positive direction from them, since they regularly have to deal with helping people get things like replacement IDs and the like.  Sure... shelters suck.  But again, it isn't all about the bed.  It is about pumping them for all the information they can give you... since that is also what you need.  I assume friends and family are non-existent in regards to getting help, else you would have asked them before posting here.  But... you should STILL consider contacting both.  I mean, you are broke and homeless.

ll6gi3,,gnq84mu,So, where do you sleep if you don't have a place to go? Street. Park. Forest. Etc. All this is technically trespassing, disturbing the peace, etc. Parks close at dusk. All illegal to sleep on in the great land of America. But where to go?  "Move along, can't sleep here." Is the standard official greeting from local law enforcement. It gets worse if you're not polite. Or if the officer is having an bad night.  And for anyone about to say it, don't say shelters. Shelters are 99% of the time a joke. Safer and cleaner on park bench.
ll6gi3,,gnq87xl,Got it
ll6gi3,gnobiwb,,We can start taxing the top 5% so they start paying their fair share of taxes and use the money to fund low income housing, mental health treatment and addiction treatment.  We can improve the quality of shelters.  We can also raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation.
ll6gi3,,gnq6ivq,Taxing should be equal to all,we can't tax rich higher becoz they are rich.
ll6gi3,,gnqncdo,Why not? All that stops such a change is the current power structure. A 100% tax on anything above a couple million would cause all sorts of sweeping changes. Downsides too I bet. Doable, probably not? Gonna happen? Not in my lifetime.
ll6gi3,,gnqrlf7,We can and do.  A flat (equal) tax unfairly hurts those in a lower income bracket.  That is the most unfair tax system.
ll6gi3,,gnrqi1q,Many would disagree.  What is "unfair" depends on your values.  If someone believes in everybody paying their fair share and values that over helping the less fortunate then they are going to see it the other way.  Their argument would be something like "why should a person pay a bigger share just because they have more money?  That is unfair.  If there are 100 people and they need to pay $100,000/year to fund a local police department for example then they each owe $1,000/year.  Any other way of funding it is unfair."  Its hard to disagree with in some ways. As a practical matter that approach of course fails since you immediately have the question of what to do about the person that doesn't have $1,000, but it is still understandable why someone would think that. It intuitively seems far more fair than punishing someone by forcing them to fund others who may or may not deserve it.

ll6gi3,gnojtvu,,You would have to allow people more freedom. The less economic and political freedom people have the harder it is to escape poverty or have a safety net to avoid homelessness. The more laws and regulations there is the more it confines and limits your freedom which is what they want. If u are not able to become independently well off u have less control over your life and far less freedom. Whenever possible u would encourage people away from dependency on the state and to be self reliant because than nobody can control u if u can take care of yourself. Homeless people aren‚Äôt even alllowed to build makeshift homes that may not be perfect but at least it would protect you from the elements and from being harmed by other predatory persons and a place to keep your possessions safe. This is an example of a lack of freedom.
ll6gi3,gnofnrs,,Universal Basic Income
ll6gi3,gnqbym3,, Can not ever really end it, some choose homeless and when you have mental issues you need trained professionals to assist. As for everyday IMO many would not suffer being homeless by simply having cheaper rents or being able to get into housing without so much red tape. If landlords would accept section 8 in many cities best guess is homeless would be cut in half. There are also places with LOTS of empty houses and no one living in the areas cause everything has moved its become a desert, so if a group where to really invest into desert areas have clean affordable housing and businesses it would be a huge way to move people off the streets and into homes. Less people on the physical streets is just be economics all around, less crime, less abuse of hospitals.
ll6gi3,gnqu7mc,,Well, if some form of Universal Basic Income (as another commenter already said) became the desperately needed standard to DEFINE Affordable Housing, and then if Affordable Housing was legislated based on that UBI, that would sure help. That would take a huge chunk out of the homeless crisis, for sure. Give or take some tenant's rights to help people without resident histories, and laws requiring said Affordable Housing all over the country, in all types of neighborhoods.  In terms of opinions and perceptions of what homelessness is, what it means, what all of the nuances are, etc, ASK THE HOMELESS FIRST. Give agency to the homeless by granting them their own narrative, their own definitions, their own solutions. And you are asking this question here, so that's great and thank you. But ALWAYS assume that the most important opinions on homelessness are those that come from the homeless.  Perhaps instead of focusing on eliminating homelessness itself, you could focus on eliminating the current perception of homelessness. The stigma. The dehumanization. The hatred. The dismissal.   You could pay close attention to relevant laws and ordinances in your immediate area and encourage others to do the same.  You could take matters into your own hands and choose one single homeless person, be it random or selected, and do whatever you can to help them get what they need. Maybe money, maybe a job, maybe a bicycle, maybe a mansion. Whatever you are capable of doing, and whatever the homeless person really needs. To completion, by the way. Not just enough for a moment or a meal. Enough to help or assist them get a roof over their heads on their own terms. Then, encourage others to do the same. Just one life. It won't solve the entire issue, which you as an individual can never solve. But it could solve one person's issue.  If you are just fascinated by the issue, there are definitely ways to pass laws/legislature that would help the vast majority of the homeless. If you want to help, there are things you can do as an individual on a person to person basis.
ll6gi3,go8pp34,,I'm 100% a *"Shelter First"* person... gimme shelter and we can work out the rest...  Secondly a paradigm shift in the way that we look at *"working for a living"*... the idea that we have to pay bills, rent, and get a job needs a serious revision
ll6gi3,gnnrwjc,,It will always exist. You can't have any sort of economy without someone being on the bottom and someone being at the top. And the bottom will always be rough, as a lot of life is relative. In my opinion, anticipating the problem and providing resources that can help with the individual problems causing the poverty/homelessness as well as the given dangers/unpleasantness of homelessness and poverty if the only effective kind of help. Kinda like an emergency plan, or a doctors office. Yes, emergencies can be avoided and if you take good care of yourself you won't really NEED a doctor per say. But you cant do much to stop something that will cause a fire from causing a fire, you can just do what you can to prevent the thing causing the fire from happening. The same goes with a broken arm, yes you can prevent braking you arm, but sometimes you just don't see that pebble on the ground and are thrown off your skateboard...into moving traffic. But then again you probably shouldn't be getting shitfaced and hoping on a wooden board with wheels. But no doctor is gonna say no to helping you heal your broken arm because you're dumb. So you cant do things like not provide free food, many many people will starve in that one night, maybe a week later, because they got problems and problems lead to more problems, and all of a sudden you're a week into not sleeping and hearing voices. Thats when you probably need free food, but I see your point in that some homeless/impoverished rely on handouts from the govt and kind people. But yeah, the problem is that they don't have the ability to get it together enough to buy food. A lot of the time you spend homeless will probably be spent sorting out personal problems, and as we all know that isn't something that can be done in a weekend, and that cant be done without a struggle. In this case, it's struggle ontop of struggle, onto of struggle. The extra help really makes a difference, and is the only thing that helps many escape homelessness
ll6gi3,,gnnwa8j,> You can't have any sort of economy without someone being on the bottom and someone being at the top.  This is true but misleading. The OP's question wasn't whether it was possible to eliminate hierarchical structures, it was whether or not it was possible to eliminate poverty and homelessness. The fact that there will always be relative poverty does not make it useless to raise the absolute condition of the poor today. We give the poor homes. That solves that problem.
ll6gi3,,gno5xyo,It doesn't solve the problem of human nature though. There will always be people who feel suffocated in a home, there will always be people who become psychotic and run out into the streets, and there will always be people who don't understand and see the hope of freedom. Not everyone will always be fit to be housed, neighbors are a problem, sometimes even being that close to people may stress someone out to a point that they are a danger to those around them. I agree, there is a way to provide a house for everyone (kinda, let's just ignore the outliners and cases of natural disaster or bureaucratic mistakes) but you will be only dealing with the problem in a literal sense. Its like plugging a hole up in the old, rotting beat up wooden boat. Those holes will keep popping up, you need to at least replace some of the wood to fix the issue. For some just providing housing will work, but for others the problem isn't even not having a home, its staying in one. It would be like putting a bandaid on it. It may fix some problems, and i mean it will help, but you sometimes need stitches, sometimes you have in infection. Sometimes you don't even know the extent of the damage. All I'm saying is JUST buying homes for everyone is a political cop out at best. I 100% think there is a way to provide shelter for everyone, but i think that in no way solves the problem of homelessness, it just changes the word and one, albeit huge, circumstance, which is misleading in the same regard that you are putting my initial statement as. Yes its true that providing housing gets rid of the problem of not having housing, but its not like someone will wake up with all bills paid, no debt, and a full time job and they will have a single thought, or maybe wake up too early and suddenly become homeless. But people do have a single thought that triggers some crazy shit, or maybe they wake up too early and the lack of sleep makes them snap, or maybe they have a heavy past that refuses to let them breathe. All of these thing can cause someone to be homeless with a shelter in place, regardless of if they pay for their stay. Drug problems, abusive relationships, etc. And what about over population? You cant provide housing for the entire population, there just isn't enough room. You cant solve the homeless problem with homes, its the people who need the help. Not their comfort
ll6gi3,,gno75nd,>It doesn't solve the problem of human nature though.  This is a red herring. Let's talk about it after two generations with UBI and free housing. The problem with your argument is that is looks back, not forward, and then prejudices a social experiment before it has even been tried.   In other words, we don't know if it is truly a problem of human nature or of culture because we have never tried alternative cultures. So let's try the experiment and find out.
ll6gi3,,gnocmf7,I couldn't agree more , I get SSD and it could be considered a form of UBI in that it is a stable monthly income - tho medically based . It is pretty much the only reason I'm not homeless . Even if the healthcare system was affordable-  w/o stable housing and income to pay for it regardless of working status - it just leads to costly band aids that never fix any problems , where as having a home base and then receiving needed help makes the outcomes better for people to be productive or happy or any more humane state of being . If housing and access to healthcare were a given right it would dramatically improve many of the social problems but like you say in your comment it hasn't really been tried -at least in this country .
ll6gi3,,gnoanyh,Nah man, i used to have the same outlook on the problem. Think about the projects, it is very very similar to this concept, and it didn't do much to help that population. there are even free programs, and they do not help enough, even if you get into them. Like I said, housing everyone WILL help but the problem is much much more complicated than just housing. I mean, have you ever been around a group of people who deal with the same problem? They are either helping eachother stand up, or tearing eachother down, and that is the same group of people, not two different groups. Yes, a culture change will def help the problem. No, that won't happen without overthrowing the government because a lot of culture revolves around what the powers that be allow you to do. Also, I know for a fact that even with free housing, people will always leave for a better life. Im not prejudiced to the idea, I just know from first and second hand experience that people don't always make logical decisions, and you can never truly count on someone to not do something. Saying that giving everyone a house will not end the issue of people not being able to stay in one, but it will fix the issue of not having one. Its something that needs to be done, but it is not the solution, just a part to the whole
ll6gi3,,gnq7i65,What's meant by cultural change?
ll6gi3,,gnqdv0v,How people treat the homeless, how the government handles it, the general attitude towards work, those sort of things
ll6gi3,,gnq6tss,But if we start to give poor homes,then nobody gonna try to fight out of poverty/homelessness,I think it will increase the issue more.maybe providing more jobs is better
ll6gi3,,gnro0fl,>homes,then nobody gonna try to fight out of poverty/homelessness  Every bit of research that has been done in the fields of entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation shows this premise to be false. People perform better in places where they feel safe and secure than in places where they feel scared and afaird. Most people prefer flight over fight. A scared population is better for command and control but it actually reduces the wealth of a nation.
ll6gi3,,gnnsvc5,I get what u saying,life is survival and everytime when we survive we are placing someone in bottom and there is no solution,but  there must be a solution
ll6gi3,,gno7xdq,There is its just not an end all, more so programs to make the process of escaping homelessness more achievable and less controlled by chaos. A housing program would help a ton, but it won't solve it. But a housing program, job training/organizations that get you a job, mental health services, free healthcare, free essentials and maybe even public showers or bathhouses, when working together, will solve the problem. But thats only because it covers as many ends to the issue as it possibly can, catch my drift? It will always have to be in motion, but it always speed up finding a house and stability (whatever that may mean to you). But like, just housing everyone kinda enables people to stay in poor spending habits/continue an unhealthy and unstable lifestyle, which would be more poverty with less responsibility...not a good thing. I mean have you ever heard of the projects? Thats basically what they were, and all they ended up being was some kinda purgatory where people can live but can't escape the pain their life has brought them
ll6gi3,gnox7c0,,> homelessness and poverty exist  These aren't exactly the same thing (except in some high cost areas). Furthermore there are numerous causes of each, especially homelessness.  Housing is very expensive in urban areas, and it's essentially privatized (indeed, being sold by individuals rather than businesses in most cases). Governments cannot simply buy houses due to the expense, and they have to pay to build new shelter as well. Local governments have generally failed to control urban sprawl, or to put it another way they allow inefficient low-density construction, which means more expensive homes for fewer people. If that situation was dealt with, they could at least relieve the "house poor" situation.  Many homeless issues aren't caused (just) by poverty, but family situations. Relationships don't always last, and so there's lots of struggling single parents. Some people are kicked out by (or flee) abusive families, frequently young people without job skills. Where I live there's a specialized LGBT shelter in the city because gay and transgendered youth get kicked out so often (and I live in liberal Canada, where gay marriage became legal a decade before it did in the US).  Many homeless issues are caused by addiction, whether to something legal (alcohol, gambling) or illegal (street drugs), or mental illness. Again, money is not a sufficient solution.  Technology is not going to solve family problems or most forms of addiction or mental illness either.

lkwntn,,gnqxao2,I don't like indians and buddha you can't understand?
lkwntn,,gnqc0y0,Because you ARE so angry. You're filled with pain, sorrow, suffering, and being homeless is miserable in this current world. There is no true backbone, the people truly have lost compassion, and those allowed to govern are incompetent fools.  Naturally, this already horrible situation now adds your mom to the list, and I'm sure it's 100 times worse.
lkwntn,gnq3r44,,From experience I will say to you what was said to me once: it doesn't get any better you just get more used to it.   That didn't make any sense to me at the time. Now it does. I still miss my mom every day and I also know if she was still here I would not be homeless now, I was always able to go "home".   Way back when I totally lost it after loosing her. I was mad at God and my friends and family all judged me for saying I hated Him/Her. But it was true and I did. A part of me still doesn't understand and truth be told...others who haven't gone through this journey do not understand. I just tried to raise my kids the best I could without her. I found other older women to be Grandma to my kids. And I stive to make her proud of me.   I truly believe now that she's with me at all times and doing whatever they do over there. I know she's with others and being the kind heart there that she was here. That's what helped me....deciding that she was needed there and deciding I would share her with others there.   You can do this. You are stronger than you think. I am saying a prayer for you.
lkwntn,,gnq7uw4,no im not strrong never,and my mother death destroyed me
lkwntn,gnn3ss7,,Dude I don't know your story but I can say one thing for sure your mom must be great person as you still miss her in such position but don't you think going forward and living life she wanted to give you will be more great way to thank her don't hate your god trust him your mom may not be here but she will give you strength when you need it just try to keep her legacy alive be the son/daughter she would be proud of.

I'll drink one for you bubba.
lk3qq8,,gnif1qs,Yeah, I came in here to say pretty much what you did.  Cold air sinks and it will always be colder near bodies of water.  In the woods on a hill you'll be much warmer.
lk3qq8,,gnif9iw,Yup. OP doesn't know it, but I've followed them for a minute and this isn't the first time I've seen that same fire pit. It's probably familiar to them, but it's not the worst idea to switch up locations unless you're in a very remote area.  Plus, like you said, that's not the ideal spot to be in winter.
lk3qq8,,iwkkz7y,Higher altitudes are colder. Find a gully between 2 hills with woods.

lk3qq8,,gnisuex,Damn. I'm over 50. I'm doooooommmmed! Or. I have enough sense to get a sleeping bag rated to below zero temps. Not much more expensive than lesser bags. I line it with a decent wool blanket. I dress in warm cloths, get thermal socks, wear a good toboggan, back it up with a hoodie, under a jacket, or insulate what I do have with multiple layers of newspaper if I can't afford better. I buy a cheap tent for twenty bucks, or, if I can't afford that, manage 5 dollars for a tarp and some line, go back in some woods or other wilderness, away from the assholes and the crackheads, and make camp. I get foodstamps so I can feed myself. I make sure I have water. I try to get a job. In the meantime, I find other sources of income. There are several. I struggle to keep my spirits up, resist despair as best I can. I refuse to make excuses despite my age, my sex, my race or my background. And I survive. And prevail. Be defeatist all you want buddy, but don't try to preach that to me. And don't offer that shit as advice on This forum!

lk3qq8,,gnnfgov,Some alcohol contains a chemical called histamine or, in some people, some alcohol will cause histamine to be naturally released in the body. Histamine makes you feel warmer.  You‚Äôre not actually warmer, you just feel warmer.   I know people drink alcohol in the cold. The flask on the slopes is a real thing. Be seriously careful with it.  The major downside is that hypothermia comes on slowly, and you get dumb headed enough that you don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs coming so you don‚Äôt respond to help yourself.

Years later, randomly, I ended up talking to someone on here who worked in a shelter in ND and he said during cold weather periods they're not allowed to turn people away, even if it means overcrowded shelters. I would imagine maybe a few other places have laws like this.

lk3qq8,gnk495m,,Might sound crazy but if you don't have a tent build an igloo. Make it below snow level, not on top. Bury yourself deep into the snow. It actually gets warm. I'm assuming the smaller the space the better. It's lowkey, too. Humans and animals still do it and it still works.      I saw somewhere else on this sub that making a fire and connecting a metal tube from it to the inside of your tent is a way to put warm air in your tent. I'm assuming the end of the tube doesn't lead to the fire but the fire is somewhere in the middle...else you have a carbon monoxide problem. Though I still worry about it melting your tent...idk...

ljq374,gnj8npy,," If you have any issues or questions, please do not hesitate to comment below this post "  Seeing endless posts about research, surveys and people asking the same questions over and over about the same things, - rather than setting aside an hour or two - and going back through the last year's worth of real posts and comments on this sub (which would tell them a lot more and answer most questions) - gets annoying. There. I feel better now.
ljq374,,gnjl6bk,[deleted]
ljq374,,gnjndiv,I get they might have good long-term intentions, but this sub is seriously like a gold-mine for anyone doing research - if they spend the time and effort to go back and read the real life, day-to-day shit that some on here have gone through. I am amazed at how much I have learned myself and I thought I knew a lot already. Everyone has a different situation and set of problems to overcome/solve and it is amazing to see what others come up with. Now if they want to pay people on here for their time participating in research or answering questions - that's another story. ‚úî
ljq374,,gnktry4,Hi u/DJ44x,   Thank you for your comments. We totally understand your concerns and agree that spending time and going through the posts is extremely valuable. We have done this and have, as you said, learned a lot more than we thought we knew already.   The questionnaire is to gain some valuable insight into this area, but it is also a requirement for our course/project gather primary research in the form of questionnaires, surveys, interviews and so on.   Unfortunately, we do not have the funding to pay people to participate in the study and understand those that do not want to participate as they do not have the time. Either way, we appreciate any response and feedback we receive.   Thank you!
ljq374,,gnn8v4f,I get what you are saying. Your single post and a single survey isn't the problem. It is the number of people doing it and the cumulative repetition of it on this sub.  I guess another reason it is annoying is that every homeless person is a singularly unique situation. Trying to classify or categorize them doesn't work. It hasn't worked for me and the stereotypes and generalizations are harmful. I have been a "hidden homeless" person for years. And I have never - and do not now - "show up in any official statistics'. I wasn't even on this sub until Covid hit last spring.
ljq374,gnjl8i2,,No. Go away.
ljq374,,go3oae4,I get it can be really annoying, especially when you are in this situation and people want to ultimately study you for their own benefit.
ljq374,gnjsqd3,,You need to define your terms before I click a link. I think I know what you mean, but how are you specifically defining "Hidden Homeless". On the one hand other commenters are correct and if you have the time to read surveys then you have the time to read older posts. On the other hand I'm glad to see more students researching homelessness, and turning to reddit seems acceptable during Covid. After Covid, go out into the field and talk to people.   I don't think that the academic approach will solve the problems of homelessness and can easily become pretentious naval gazing. But seeing homeless rights as a civil right's issue is desperately needed and a glaring omission. If we can change the mindset of the non-homeless person and force them to see the homeless as "real people", then progress can occur. I think that students like this provide an excellent opportunity for the homeless to guide that discussion in the right direction, even if in a small way.
ljq374,,gnktuop,Hi u/gr2020od,  Thank you for taking the time to comment on our post and give us some feedback.   We are very sorry that we didn't better define 'Hidden Homelessness'. In short, we are defining Hidden Homeless as people who do not have a permanent home address and are staying with friends, in temporary accommodation, bed & breakfasts, hotels, cars, and so on. As a result, they are 'Hidden' as they do not show up in any official statistics.   Following on from this, you are completely correct with your comments about COVID having an effect on our academic approach to this topic. I mentioned it in a comment above, but we planned on gathering insights by experiencing what its like first-hand, and working with people to understand and learn from there experiences. Due to COVID, we haven't been cleared to do this by our University and so Reddit gives us an effective way to communicate and talk to people. Also, please be reassured that we have spent time going through earlier posts and have found it extremely valuable, but we need to gather information through questionnaires as this is how were graded.   Also, our project is actually partially working towards changing the mindsets and perspectives of people and helping them realise that homeless people are still people.  Thank you very much for your time, and we have taken your comments on board.

lhuc52,gmzp8e7,,Coyotes are...coyotes. Please be careful even though they are cute pups.
lhuc52,gn0uzqz,,Coyotes are very interesting creatures. Personally I think they are beautiful. This is the mating season for them so they often go out solo or just with their mate. Also adult coyotes are not very big, only about 40 pounds, though their fur can make them look a little bigger. They are rarely a threat to an adult human and will usually avoid people, although they are attracted to discarded food and the rodents that are often found near people.   As others have said, don‚Äôt feed them, and that includes leaving food trash where they can get it. When coyotes associate people with food it makes them more likely to approach which can be dangerous for the coyote in the long term.
lhuc52,gn14qr8,,I had a red fox in the riverbed, at first i was causing a fit because of all the kittens and wild cats, but he was relentless.  He was my friend. And I swear, for the 2 years I was there, I know he was on his best behavior around the cats. At least when he knew I was watching üòâ.

lhbtg1,gn4di69,,The main problem is buried and hidden under the very foundations of a Capitalistic social system.   People who are privileged are safe, because they are usually born into the top of the capitalistic tower, The Middle class is what sticks everything together... They work for themselves but mainly for those on the top.   Now the working class is just fighting a war to climb up said tower, Their lives revolve in this sole purpose for obvious reasons.      But the homeless are the ones who are not even part of the tower, these people have been left outside the tower and the doors have been closed on them (Education, Opportunities, Family support, Money, Social resources...) This people are outliers and have been left out of the social tower, and they are not seen as human... only those inside the tower are considered human.      No wonder these people are as hated as Communists, For the people in the tower they are seen as a threat. At least thats where the problem begins
lhbtg1,,gxu72cp,Capitalistic social system, Communism, Middle Class all these words and classifications we use yet we dont have a clue what they mean other than that they are supposed to be bad, yet most of us dont even know why. communism is bad we think yet if you have a body of govt thats moral compas is so true that it is without reproach then having the body of people share evenly the wealth can lead tovery prospourus times. unfortunatley we live in an age were absolute power will corrupt absolutley, but that does not make the system itself evil. a small community in space could be communist, where they all share equal rights and ownerships to all things, yet have a system of ethics in place that works for them, it wouldnt make them monesters. i think dictators suck doesnt make the people they dicate bad.   &#x200B;  in my opinion it is the very system itself that needs changing. we say homeless like having a home is somehow a thing that if you dont have your somehow lessor for. ive known many poeple without a thing who are richer than any man i know with a home. ive known may people with homes who would prefer the freedom of having less belongings. i think that if we are ever going to truly adress inequality not only as a notion but as a human race we need to find places and ways that we can put aside our political and religious leanings and all agree on a level of humanity that is acceptable. we all have it in our power to do better. creating a federally funded program along the likes of social security with jobs for workers and the goal to connect with and help improve any and all involuntarily transitory people and help them get stability and direction in there lives by providing intense one on one case management to help assess and support thier need.
lh8mn7,gmyruv7,,Well if there's any crumbs they best not be begging for them , that's my forte ,lol  edit,  ps-anyone got any spare crumbs ...puuhllease, what about you sir ? spare any crumbs please ? thank you god bless and have a nice day . DollbabyLG i almost didn't see you there how about you ,spare me a crumb or two ? they dont have to be biscuit crumbs id be more than happy with breadcrumbs ,or even cracker crumbs , lol .  how's things ,I  hope your good and your covid test came back negative  :)
lh8mn7,,gmz4fjo,Stinki crumbs
lh8mn7,,gmz8fkd,lol not the dreaded stinki crumbs, hey how you doing bro have you made it to the bay area yet
lh8mn7,,gmz8j6b,I‚Äôll be there on the 17th!! I‚Äôm doing okay. How are you?!
lh8mn7,,gmzb6sn,ah not long then ,6 days . yeah im good over here thanks man :)
lh8mn7,,gn0q16x,My test came back negative, thank you for asking. Struggling a lot emotionally, but thanks to some people here like you... I have a few smiles and feel goods every day.   How are you? What‚Äôs happening in your life?

lh8mn7,,gmwkerd,Whoops. https://www.reddit.com/user/ilovethenoke
lh8mn7,,gmy3n7e,Maybe he just needed help.  I've posted in the random pizza a few times.  And also on amazon wishlist because I needed help.  When I finally was able to, I bought pizzas for people and bought things from there wishlist anonymously.  We don't know when someone falls off the wagon and needs assistance.  And we don't know if they're returning the favor.  Just my two cents.
lh8mn7,,gmye45r,That‚Äôs all fine, but they are coming here and begging/soft-begging which is NOT allowed.
lh8mn7,,gmykb21,Sorry. I didn't know that.
lgdvpj,gmqvzti,,We got a ruling like that here in the PNW. They're still finding ways and loopholes to continue sweeps.
lgdvpj,,gmqyvcn,I got caught camping in city limits, so when I went to court for it i cited Martin v. Boise and the judge cut me loose. No court fees or anything!!! üôÇ Fight the power: fight the system!!!!
lgdvpj,,gmr771m,I will remember this and do a bit of homework üòÄ
lgdvpj,,gndot6n,Knowledge is power my friendüòÅ
lgdvpj,,gnefa3t,UNLIMITED POOOOWAAAAH üòÅ
lgdvpj,gmrm3ea,,There's a completely different justice/legal system for the poor, in the land of the free?
lgdvpj,,gmt0l19,Land of the free is fenced off and posted with no trespassing signs.
lgdvpj,gmqxsu4,,It's truly a step in the right direction. I don't think people realize how meaningful it is when the courts rule in favor of homeless rights. An even bigger win would be changing the hearts and minds of the "I'm as liberal as they get, BUT..." types who are against such court rulings.   Maybe this will be a year of great progress. I hope so.
lgdvpj,gmrakj3,,It‚Äôs good to see this type of legislation. Now, if they could include places for homeless people to PARK overnight; that would be a great relief. I‚Äôve been homeless for 4 months, and I‚Äôve had three times as many interactions with law enforcement. I hope it keeps trending upward for the needy.
lgdvpj,gmrzfs8,,What case was it? (The Federal case)
lgdvpj,,gms7nlh,Murder was the Case
lfjn3d,gmmaf7y,,Not just a week. a month or 2 would teach them reality
lfjn3d,,gmmehgx,I can see that. Theft, gaslighting, and despiration.  Maybe show them what it's like to live in the shelters too. Let alone fight the Waiting List, for a bed.  I'm sure they'd love the people drinking in there.
lfjn3d,,gmmemrb,Hopefully they get a really bad case of athletes foot and scabies. Also bedbugs.
lfjn3d,,gmmgtdv,and after showing them give them a good hard kick in the bollocks
lfjn3d,gmmseyr,,I would LOVE to see this happen. They wouldn‚Äôt last 2 nights.
lfjn3d,gms5kkc,,Yes and they have to do it through the whole winter
lfjn3d,gmnmlt7,,I agree 100% let them see how it really is!! They would be clueless. Starve, freeze, have no place to use the restroom or wash their hands. And I hope they would get their stuff stolen!!! They don't have a clue do they???
lfjn3d,gmnqsog,,They would not survive 24 hours.
lfjn3d,gmn3kkj,,That's just the thing. I have already seen one years ago did the homeless thing temporarily to no avail. It had to be 20 to 30 years ago. I still believe that the only reason politicians say they care is to score political points for trying to do something about it. They get funds and possibly redirect to their pet projects when the ideas of solving homeless didn't work! I could be wrong but really? They know what most of the problems are of being homeless. However, no one like the cruel results of putting homeless in rehabilitation and learning to  be a productive person. I was homeless 2 times! I got pissed and got myself out of being homeless. I was also lucky. I wasn't on anything drug wise. You really have to want to get out of it. Now, go ahead and bash me for not being homeless anymore and for being truthful.
lfjn3d,,gmobarh,Nobody is here to bash you. Some people in this community can feel frustrated but know that in our hearts we are all glad that one less person needs to go through this shit.  The best thing you can do as a clean, productive member of society is be an advocate to those left behind.
lfjn3d,,gmr0iov,Well said! Actually, 2 years ago during Thanksgiving wife and I did the volunteer in a church kitchen to feed the needy. I didn't do well mentally with it. To this day, I cannot remember why. It had to be because of when I was homeless I guess.
lfjn3d,gmmhz67,,I think there would be even a better yest for them. How about going out without anything except for the clothes they are wearing. Having to rely on, God to feed them [I think this would be the ultimate Test.](https://youtu.be/7nzAVCVvH78) Jesus, sent out His disciples two two, with just the clothes they were wearing. It is a good faith building excersize.
lfjn3d,gmoe6dp,,and then have them cut down after two days and have to figure something out.
lfjn3d,gmpchym,,A mayor in Aurora, CO tried this and everyone got mad at him.
lfjn3d,gmpk7xq,,It's not even LEGAL to sleep in a tent in any of our local park in my city......
lfjn3d,gmnwhi7,,Agree
lfjn3d,hplhyh4,,At least
lfuxfe,gmo6ucv,,Good luck OP
lfuxfe,,gmo72br,Tyvm. This is about the 8th day in a row with double digit negative temps at night.
lfuxfe,,gmo79bx,That really sucks. I cant even image how awful that temp is to try to sleep in.  Do you turn on your car every so often to get a little bit of heat?
lfuxfe,,gmo7kys,Oh yes, and heated seats too. Luckily I have enough warmth to survive, but I sleep mostly in the day if I dont have work.
lfuxfe,,gmo7u5o,Aye the heated seats sound fantastic.    It still sucks though, but I wish the best for you, and hopefully it starts to warm up again soon
lfuxfe,,gmo7x6g,Ty.
lfuxfe,gmocyq4,,You too. This cold looks like it's here for a while and only going to get lower...
lfuxfe,,gmod7md,No doubt. It's ok during the day but right now even with 3 blankets it's still coldddd.
lfuxfe,,gmodcc3,Damn. Well, at least you've made me feel a little bit better about my prospects of weathering single-digit negatives this coming weekend...
lfuxfe,,gmqcmhy,I live in NH and was pissed when I had to shovel snow off of my car this morning. wish I had a benz like OP! haha good luck bud.
lfuxfe,,gmrdpjc,The defrost on my van no longer works, as the heat no longer works ‚Äî so I had a hell of a time chiseling myself out today. I don't mind brushing off snow ‚Äî it's kissing off the ice, and shaving off the frost from the *inside* of the van, that I absolutely loathe.  Fortunately I was able to get some deicer a few days ago that helped tremendously. And I also got a propane "Buddy" heater ‚Äî and used it as a makeshift defroster that worked reasonably well.
lfuxfe,gmoic5z,,Oh dear God, I hope you‚Äôre ok
lfuxfe,gmodpjf,,The shiny part of that reflector should be pointing towards you. It won't keep in any heat if it's backwards.
lfuxfe,,gmodsy7,Ok got it but its night time rn
lfuxfe,,gmoethn,It still will reflect/conserve heat, like those space blankets.
lfuxfe,gmo5rwz,,You too my friend. You look cozy.
lfuxfe,,gmo61dg,It's ok better than outside. Got 3 blankets and couple of layers on.
lfuxfe,,gmo6qkz,:) sweet sleep üò¥
lfuxfe,gmoys2d,,Stay warm. You must be in the Midwest?
lfuxfe,,gmoytnq,Yes Wisconsin
lfuxfe,,gmozcna,I'm in Minnesota, are you near the boarder? I could offer you some supplies. I know we've had lots of food drives this past week as well. I have a pair of size 10 boots, some heavy pants, etc.
lfuxfe,,gmozie5,No, but thanks for the offer.
lfuxfe,,gmp01fm,Shoot I'm sorry.
lfuxfe,,gmp352r,Yikes   The fucking snow up there.
lfuxfe,gmp59i0,,I feel ya! While it‚Äôs not THAT cold here on the East Coast, it sure feels like it. Without my tent now it‚Äôs even more miserable. I‚Äôve got a 0¬∞ sleeping bag but that doesn‚Äôt cut it sometimes.
lfuxfe,gmo3750,,Your car is nicier than mine.....stay warm!!
lfuxfe,gmry27b,,At least you have shelter....
lfuxfe,godc1gf,,Switch to a Toyota or lexus nonhybrid op
lfuxfe,gmoe9gf,,U live in a nice Benz? What happened to u to be so broke where u are homeless now ? Drugs?
lfuxfe,,gmoef9o,Way to jump to conclusion. Just because have have Mercedes means I'm prone to homelessness?? I bought this car in 2009 when I was 17. I'm 28 now. Idk something like a virus causes people to lose almost everything.
lfuxfe,,gmoj60m,[removed]
lfuxfe,,gmp3l4z,Not everyone is an addict.  And so what if he is.  And so what he has a Mercedes. It's none of your business.  I'd rather rely on german engineering to keep warm, than a shelter.  Stop judging people.
lfuxfe,,gn925dr,Also not to mention the resale on an old benz isn't that great. Whats OP going to do? Sell it and have no shelter or transportation?
lfuxfe,,gn92nm5,\*you
lfcg09,gml307q,,Get a sign and start asking for money at a busy foot traffic place. Might get $50 out of it.
lfcg09,,gml3aov,I might just have to swallow my pride and do that thank you.
lfcg09,,gmme7do,We got to do what we got to do. I always told myself that I could never fly a sign. That my pride would always get in the way and that it was just downright embarrassing. I ended up not having any other choice. I had to put my pride aside and hold up that sign.
lfcg09,,gmmtuii,Here‚Äôs the thing: hunger will always win over pride. The human will to survive is the most powerful instinct we have.
lfcg09,gml80tw,,Ok so at least you have "a spot*  You can still do those gigs without a car. If there's an Observa gig near you, they pay so fast it isn't funny!
lfcg09,,gmlawqx,I will check it out thank you for the info and help it does not go unappreciated
lfcg09,gml43pt,,You have a car????? Hustle up some gas money, then head to EasyShift, GigWalk, Observa (you'll be paid in hours with them!), FieldAgent or SurveyMerchandiser. $500 a week... easily!!
lfcg09,,gml7apj,Yeah sadly my tags are expired as well as my license i do have a job interview wednesday tho so hopefully it takes off
lfcg09,,gmm4syf,I know this is a hard one. But have you thought about selling your car?  If you can't drive it legally it's just gonna cause a entirely new set or problems down the line.  You definitely need the cash, and it's material thing that can easily be replaced.
lfcg09,,gmmbc7u,Oh God do not sell your car!! You can overcome the challenges preventing you from driving. Just fly a sign to get the money that you need. Also, your car is a sort of shelter that keeps you safe. Yeah ignore anyone who says sell your vehicle because it's value is more than just $$.
lfcg09,,gmmcac5,Sorry.  Was just a thought.
lfcg09,,gmmhu76,I know you meant well and were only trying to help. I'm sure someone else will read your advice and take it to heart because that will be the right solution for them.
lfcg09,,gmlkht3,Look up the laws in your area.  Many states gave temporarily extended tags and license requirements because of Covid.
lfcg09,gmnksmx,,  You got to swallow your pride and ask your kids Grandmother for some cash or basically get out with a sign and ask ppl. DO NOT sell your car you can get insurance & renew a tag getting rid of your car will pretty much put you out on the street physically. Local food pantry, church and see if you can get a few days food. HOPING you will get job!
lfcg09,gmlbeql,,hmm ..another one of them hmmm type posts  &#x200B;  ps-what is ramen ,i dont think we have it in england i thought it was noodles but americans call noodles noodles so im puzzled
lfcg09,,gmlhmwi,>what is ramen  Might be more familiar to you as pot noodles, instant pot noodles, instant noodles or something similar.  Think asian-ish noodles in broth.  Calorie dense, but high in sodium.  Edit: like most types of foods, there is a wide range available from crap to heavenly.
lfcg09,,gmlhzx2,ahh okay yeah we have pot noodles and instant noodles that are very cheap some are 5 packets for ¬£1  edit  like this https://imgur.com/a/eiVCbLi
lfcg09,,gmmnnu9,In england they have kidney pudding and spotted dick
lfcg09,,gmmos2t,lol indeed we do ,steak and kidney pudding and spotted dick and custard.. we have things called faggots that we eat as well ,and toad in the hole  but...we have clean foreskins ,lol
lfcg09,,gmmp4i3,Bubble and squeak; blood pudding ewew
lfcg09,,gmn1ped,have u heard of  black pudding? ,its awful ..made from congealed pigs blood and part of a traditional full english breakfast , i cant eat it just because of what its made from
lfcg09,,gmn2pvn,Yes üò∑ gross lol
lfcg09,,gmmpfmb,I havent been back in several years. I loved hanging out in north Wales. I was in Snowdonia national park, then went to Anglesey and took the ferry to Dublin. When i come back i want to spend time in the Lake District.
lfcg09,,gmn1iel,yeah the lake district is a nice place ,im about 50 miles from there so ive been quite a few times,ive also been to snowdon as i was born in wales
lfcg09,,gmmp17i,Rotfl
lfcg09,,gmlckeb,Yes they are microwavable noodles lol
lfcg09,,gmld1jq,ahh ok ,thanks :)
lfcg09,gmnovux,,Dumpster diving and trash picking. Plenty of food in dumpsters....go at night or in the day if the dumpster is a bit away from the business. Check pizza places after they close. For trash picking.. A lot of.people throw out all kinds of useful things. I find things and sell them on Craigslist. Makes a bit of cash. Have found things like musical instruments, fans, toaster ovens, raduos,  laptops, etc. Sold a small cheapy guitar i found in the trash for $30 last week. Keep the items in your trunk.
letjp9,gmiziwc,,Because people want others to suffer even if it costs them more.   Take the housing first approach-it actually saves a shit ton of money for taxpayers, but they refuse to allow it because "no one should get anything for free!" Even if it means hurting themselves to prevent that someone from.getting a home. Like wtf man, that's dedication to hatred.
letjp9,,gmj244a,Now Democrats arent exactly doing much for the homeless but the Republicans are the ones that really push the narrative that if we gave the homeless housing that no one would pay for housing. Its the same argument that if you give the poor assistance then people wont work. This argument is directly tied to projection. A lot of Republicans think everyone would be lazy because that is what they would do if they wernt afraid of being shamed by other Republicans.
letjp9,gmjhhx9,,And this Ladies and Gentlemen is why Karl Marx was right
letjp9,gmkmtjf,,So many places have tiny homes for the homeless. You dont have to wait 1-2 years for housing.
letjp9,gmofn9n,,I'm not surprised. if you knew how cramped a nyc subway is. plus COVID-19,  people weren't being allowed to sit in most benches anyway, plus the rise in crime by homeless.
lewtlj,gmilqd2,,Do you have money? Ask her what do you need
lewtlj,gmkkh5a,,Honestly she'll be happy to get any help you can offer. It would be best to give her some cash, or just stop and ask what she needs and go and buy it.   Its not awkward or weird, and I guarantee she'll be overwhelmed that someone is stopping to help her.
lewtlj,gmlnv6m,,squat down next to her ,say hello how are you doing i thought this may come in handy and put 20 dollars in her hand and say get yourself what you need or something along those lines , she will most likely say god bless you thanks so much ,it will make her day . that's what I've done before and nobody ever said no thanks ,one dude started crying -i have been homeless myself so i know what its like ,even if they wanna spend it on drugs or booze thats there business who am i to judge i mean what else they gonna spend it on an ornament for there mantlepiece ,a rug for there hallway ,a fkin coffee table
lewtlj,,gmmhmf5,I did that...I gave her $20, and bought her lunch and nuggets she could eat later.  Ironically, my son came home today concerned about her (not knowing what I had done).  He took one of our Ikea blue bags and put a pillow, one of their fleece throws, water bottles and a huge gallon bag full  of granola bars.  He went to give it to her today and she said she was good.  He is so stubborn he knows her "stops/places" and is leaving it for her in another spot just in case.  Thank you so much for the tips.
lewtlj,,gmmhy91,ahh bless you ,i bet it made her day  edit -and your son , you have a caring and compassionate family :)
lewtlj,,gmsgkdk,OP is an amazing person. They gave me a little bit of money so my family could have one last Christmas meal before we get evicted from my childhood home. They are truly great people.
lewtlj,gmilsnh,,I know it can be difficult to find a line between condescending and helping, but honestly, this woman sounds like she's really down on her luck. I tend to just be as polite as possible and offer help.
lezhln,gmkeg5z,,Check out the Search bar for some great past responses to this questions as it‚Äôs asked a few times a week.
lezhln,gmlkp2f,,New underwear. Oh how I longed for new, clean underwear when I was first homeless. Going commando was not fun and for the females especially, feminine products are very much needed.
lezhln,gmj26yc,,Cough drops
lezhln,,gmj7c15,Oh! That's a good point, thank you for the tip! :)
lezhln,,gmkjhqm,There are also vitamin C drops available at the dollar store, so maybe a pack of each? *Not* the sugar-free stuff, though. A lot of times that little extra sugar makes a big difference.
lezhln,,gpv5s41,Yeah depending on location Dollar tree everything is a dollar so you could definitely do a lot of care packages and not break your bank

le4h6h,gm9ea0l,,Nice! Enjoy it :D
le4h6h,gm9ed32,,I stayed in an Airbnb in November and again throughout January. Basically every time I get a stimulus payment i get a Airbnb üòÖ
le4h6h,gm9ee5t,,I've always wondered about the qualities of this brand. I can't get a laptop to last while homeless even though I'm super careful with them. I've had them warp the lid. Things get lose, stuff like that.
le4h6h,,gm9injn,it‚Äôs a great brand! RTX 1060 8gb picked it up for 300 on ebay
le4h6h,,gm9mp9a,Gtx, I'm assuming, the rtx is the 3000's but you're playing Valhalla so I'm assuming you're getting good frame rates? I.have a desktop with a 1660 I need to trade for a laptop, the one I'm currently on is not good for must of the games I payed for. But it can play no man's sky pretty ok.   Disclaimer: this was not soft begging lol.
le4h6h,,gm9q2cg,right sorry GTX
le4h6h,,gm9r3wj,It's ok, I'm a bit nerdy like that. I fix, custom build, clean computers and stuff for money.
le4h6h,,gmg958p,I would love for you to clean my laptop, being a student and always on my laptop it gets so dirty üòÇ Any tips would be wonderful
le4h6h,gmaof7b,,How have I never thought about Airbnb? I'm speechless. All that money I wasted on hotel rooms. I feel dumb and I'm now going to go stand in a corner and think about what I've done.
le4h6h,,gmbk2fd,You made me snort. Lol
le4h6h,,gmgbokm,Hahaha....sometimes the most obvious thing in front is we are oblivious to. It‚Äôs about connecting the dots and we simple just don‚Äôt. Go figure. Stress, sleep deprivation, hunger all contribute to not being as sharp as we can be. I want to say we all have a learning curve and sometimes we are on the slow train. Don‚Äôt beat yourself over. You got this now going forward.
le4h6h,gm9dhku,,Good for you!! I've been staying at airbnb.
le4h6h,,gm9dju7,month to month or just once in a while?
le4h6h,,gma7xsc,Month to month
le4h6h,,gma82bn,oh ok
le4h6h,,gmac16m,Been here since December. Not the ideal place but it will do
le4h6h,gma489p,,In a day??
le4h6h,,gma4fpz,haha two days i got! gotta watch the super bowl!!!
le4h6h,,gma7ida,Happy for you homie ü§ò
le4h6h,,gma7pcv,you need anything that can get you through the night?
le4h6h,,gma98dz,Me? No I‚Äôm straight bro, I‚Äôm doing way better than I‚Äôm sure 99% of homeless people. I‚Äôve got a big tent with a TV, a gaming laptop just like yourself, mattress, electric blanket, a generator and gas/food money. I‚Äôm basically living in a tiny hotel room with no toilet/shower. I‚Äôve been extremely fortunate but I really appreciate you lookin out and trying to spread the wealth. We gotta stick together.
le4h6h,,gma9dlk,true
le4h6h,,gmd7qpq,Wow lucky you! Lol I hope that didn't come off as asshole-ish. Glad you're doing well though
le4h6h,,gmelz49,No not assholish at all. On the contrary, I‚Äôm kinda pissed that all of us aren‚Äôt in my situation or are homeless at all tbh. We‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to be the greatest country in the world, we have the most billionaires of any country, none of us should be living like this.  I try to give back to those less fortunate whenever I can, but one person can only do so much. We need help. A homeless person shouldn‚Äôt be the only person trying to help out another homeless person ya know? OP can barely afford a room for the weekend but is still trying to help **others**. I think it‚Äôs so sad that we‚Äôre many times the only people that we have.  Sorry for the rant lol. I am lucky, you‚Äôre right, and I‚Äôm thankful for it everyday. And when I get out of this situation, one of my goals is to help as many people that‚Äôre in my situation as I can.
le4h6h,,gms7yeq,How does your generator power all that? How do you even protect all that from theft?
le4h6h,,gmsl0u7,Tbh, those 3 don‚Äôt even bring it up to >25% power. There are things that use a lot of electricity and things that don‚Äôt. For instance, a small space heater by itself on low brings it up past 25%. Air fryer does the same thing. It has to do with what kind of power it‚Äôs converted into upon use, it‚Äôs weird I know.  As for protection, I honestly don‚Äôt. I used to, I would just put a lock on the zipper, but I‚Äôve been in the same spot for over a year now (homeless period for coming up on 3 (Jesus that‚Äôs depressing, I‚Äôm only 27 lol)) and no ones even come back here other than a social worker who knew what to look for and a mentally disabled dude wandering the woods a couple times. I‚Äôve even went to a hotel for a week multiple times and nothing was bothered.   And it‚Äôs wild because I‚Äôm not in a great area, and I‚Äôm in the woods but I‚Äôm relatively close to the street. Like you can see my tent from the street if the leaves have fallen and you squint. But no other homeless people are around (at least not in the woods) and the way to the tent looks like a shortcut to another side of town, so I‚Äôm pretty sure people who see me cut just think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. And if anyone has seen me enter the tent, even someone who would want to take my stuff if they knew, I‚Äôm pretty certain they couldn‚Äôt imagine in a million years a homeless dude, let alone one in this area, has all that. On top of all that, my laptop is usually buried in junk or my comforter, so I doubt someone would see it even if they came looking, meaning the only thing of value they‚Äôd see is the TV. And honestly TV‚Äôs are relatively cheap these days. You can get a 4K 43‚Äù for $2-300 meaning not only can I just buy another one, but so could the thief. And even though nobody else would really care, I feel like they‚Äôd still be self-conscious enough to think hauling a television outside the woods might not be worth it.  Then you‚Äôve got the biggest deterrent, that since the library closed from covid, I‚Äôm usually in my tent like 23 hours a day nowadays lol. But like I said, even that being the case, no one has come back here, nor did they when I spent most of my time at the library. Again, fortunate, I know. But I think I deserve some credit also. The place I picked is close enough (less than a minute walk) to the street that it‚Äôs not a trek but is deep enough in the trees that you‚Äôd have to know what to look for to see it and when the leaves are even half grown, it‚Äôs invisible.  Also I‚Äôve got a BB gun ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

lczt3g,gm3cc3c,,Pride goes out the window when you must do whatever it takes to survive.
lczt3g,,gm3h2qv,Flight or flight.
lczt3g,gm3v13q,,Man, that brought back memories! When I became homeless me and my ex were desperately trying to cling to the tattered shreds of the life that we knew. The first week or so on the street we had a shopping cart caravan (four carts sometimes held together with bungees, ropes, etc) And it was such a burden! Moving it was a huge production that took both of us, one of us had to basically just sit with the stuff all day, it was such a relief when we finally stopped caring and just let most of it get stolen.
lczt3g,,gm3wo2v,God after your shit gets stolen in the dead of night while you sleep out of your shopping cart its crazy how much of an extremity everything else becomes and how you dont trust a soul afterwards. Sorry for the ROS. I just remember taking ALL my things into stores with me not being able to leave anything outside while i get a drink or something. Sad as ph√¥.
lczt3g,,gm5v899,What ever happened to your ex? Did you guys fight or something?
lczt3g,,gm5ximj,We had a fairly unhealthy relationship, especially towards the end, things were unraveling fast by the time we became homeless. We had been together for 5 years and had been through a lot together. We were very codependent, almost to the point of being symbiotic. But we had some very unhealthy patterns, he had some anger issues and he had gotten physical. It was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to do but I broke up with him about a month after we became homeless. It was the right move but I describe it as feeling like I was ripping off my own arm.   We‚Äôre both doing better now, still see him occasionally just due to slight overlap in our circles. He‚Äôs dealt with a lot of his demons and is in a happier place now. I am too. While I was on the street I met my current boyfriend and we finally got housing about 6 months ago.
lczt3g,,gm5xryo,That's pretty damn cool.
lczt3g,gm335vc,,It‚Äôs a great sign!

larxj3,glqmn0l,,All the money spent in showing how being homeless is a failure of society & government could solve homelessness if the powers that be weren't so greedy.
larxj3,,gm0nlal,Welcome to Capitalism my friend
larxj3,glq9fhi,,I disagree with this approach. Do people really think that shame and guilt are going to make people treat the homeless better? I don't think so.   I continue to feel that Jesus had it best. The parable of the good samaritan isn't about shame and guilt, it is about mercy and justice. It is about seeing the stranger as a neighbor. It is not about thinking differently, it is about how we are all the same.
larxj3,,glwlqne,I've struggled with mental illness, addiction, homelessness, employment, everything else, etc.   My sister has a little anxiety but otherwise multiple degrees, a great job, a husband with a great job, kids etc. She is a good person yet kinda lives in an upper middle-class bubble.  If it wasn't for me and a brother of her husband they would be in a much much smaller bubble. She does a lot for people and is genuinely a good person however I must again emphasize their bubble.  Something like one of these posters would absolutely give that bubble of hers a little poke and would likely lead to two things; 1) she would take a pic that she would share on social media along with relating to homelessness through me and 2) a creative reminder like this of what she has and others don't and that is not normally right in her face would probably get some donations out of her.  My sister donates clothes food and money periodically to different things and something like this would very likely encourage another that day.          It's easy to get stuck in a bubble and not even realize it. It happens to all of us. Most of us probably have some perspective or set of circumstances right now that alter the what we notice around us and in society overall. We all have biases and the worst ones are the ones we dont realize that are there or refuse to acknowledge.
larxj3,,gm0oj8r,I believe Capitalism itself is a big bubble that at the same time enables this other inner bubbles... I believe the ancient Romans fucked humanity real bad
larxj3,glpoa31,,This is performative at best
larxj3,,glred2t,But better than taking pictures of actually homeless people and putting them everywhere.
larxj3,glpzyna,,üéº You can't even watch, no, you can't eat.. You ain't supposed to be here! üé∂
larxj3,glppb96,, As a veteran sign holder, I can appreciate this.
larxj3,glqwy55,,idk that one on the right looks like it might be a pretty decent spot
larxj3,glqgge6,,Surprised that people were *unaware* until now.
larxj3,glqnwhv,,"raising awareness"  like most people don't know homelessness is even a thing
larxj3,,glqrlwd,It is NOT in most people‚Äôs faces every day.
larxj3,,glwm6sa,If it wasn't for me homelessness very likely would never cross into my sisters bubble. Seeing this would be very likely to lead to my sister taking a pic and sharing it on social media along with her personal connection to homelessness through me. It would also likely lead to her making some kind of donation either that day or by the weekend.
larxj3,glqurr1,,Is it just me, or is homelessness the one thing that doesn't need "awareness" as everyone knows it exists. It's talked about everywhere.
larxj3,,glres0m,I got in a Twitter argument yesterday with someone defending their "right" to post pictures of homeless people and their tents. They refused to believe that we don't need more "awareness" or that it was exploitive to use pictures without consent. They didn't care that it might expose those people to violence either. I'm fed up with "allies"!
larxj3,,glwmjss,I'm on the fence with that exploitive part. It really depends on the why and how it's used. There is no expectation of any privacy in public and when Im homeless I expect none. That is one of the hardest parts of being homeless, no privacy or safe place for me to get away and be alone.
larxj3,,glwp8xk,I think it's bizarre to say there should be no expectation of privacy in public. I don't know who decided that but I wish it would change. People have a right to not be photographed or filmed against their will no matter where they are.
larxj3,,gly35o1,That would effectively prevent the use of security cameras anywhere and all public photography.
larxj3,,glysiq6,Security camera footage isn't usually taken to put online. I meant random people taking pictures of other random people for no reason isn't cool.
larxj3,glqnivy,,Why not help the homeless instead of doing this? :/
larxj3,glqjve7,,That's cool, but is it helping the homeless? Other than giving then a poster to sit on?
larxj3,glqvrg2,,There are most certainly words there.
larxj3,,glqvuu2,Also, I've been there. Its horrible. Always remember that they are human beings too.
larxj3,j5v9vkt,,Frankly, most people, if not nearly all, are supportive of homeless people at least at first and would strike up a conversation with them. But after the first, second, third, 8th homeless man tries to attack you / is aggressive / calls you names after you make visual contact with them - most people learn their lesson and stop looking.
lbark6,gm0q616,,I find GPS application particularly helpful while homeless
lbark6,gm22e3z,,Make an app that connects people who need money or a place to sleep with people who want to donate. Sort of like a combination of couch surfing.org and r/assistance
la1ojt,gllyen7,,Tell me how to give the girl $5. She needs it more than the cookie company.
la1ojt,,gln5lyf,This.
la1ojt,gllkk9x,,Do they sell cookies year around? I don't even like girl scout cookies that much and I'm not financially on the best foot, but I know some people who would love to give them their money.
la1ojt,,gln039h,I don't know what percentage goes to them directly, but they have a donate link here! https://www.girlscoutsnyc.org/en/whatgirlsdo/gs-troop-6000.html
la1ojt,glnmlsw,,I don't want to sound cynical but, is the troop being made up of homeless girls exploitative or genuinely goes to benefit them and their quality of life from purchasing cookies from them rather than just having like a GoFundMe type thing, legitimate inquiry.
la1ojt,,glozdj9,I think Girl Scouts provides more than just a monetary benefit. It provides the girls a group where they can learn useful skills, gain a sense of belonging, and have a sense of stability in an environment that is not stable (living in a shelter). The link provided above allows you to donate if you prefer instead of buying cookies.
la1ojt,gllm0uq,,Thank you for this!
la1ojt,glp2p9f,,I just have to wonder if one of the girls gets housing, do they kick her out of the troop? Would be weird, but they almost have to to be honest in the claim about it.
la1ojt,,gnqvtxk,Maybe "transfer" is a preferable term?  :-)
la1ojt,glpdjxq,,[here‚Äôs the link for the cookies.](https://digitalcookie.girlscouts.org/scout/troop6000-161) it looks like they‚Äôve sold 60k so far
la1ojt,gln07fa,,Donate/purchase/volunteer links are available on their troop page, just be sure to specify troop 6000 when you donate :)  https://www.girlscoutsnyc.org/en/whatgirlsdo/gs-troop-6000.html

lah4mo,glp39dg,,> Orange clown lied, checks aren't out yet. Mailed on Jan 6 is a lie. They're coming, but it's still just a promise.   I'm not an orange clown, nor am I a supporter of the Orange Clown or his administration.  That said, I too was informed on the IRS page that my check was mailed on Jan 6th.  No check ever arrived.  INSTEAD, on Jan 25th, I got a debit card in the mail.  I followed the instructions, called the telephone number, entered the card number into the system, and activated the card.  I was then informed that my balance was $600.  I then went to the website in the details on the paperwork, created an account, and transferred the entire balance to my bank account (which I did not have when the first stimulus package was sent out).  The transfer took two days.  My campmate got their card as well, the same day.  They got theirs mailed to GENERAL DELIVERY.
lah4mo,,glp8meq,Dang, I wish I got it in card form. I was working on my new id and replacement social security card when covid hit. And I can't cash these stupid paper checks.
lah4mo,,glp9kas,So you got the second stimulus as a paper check?  What day did it arrive?  Because the point of my posting is that they aren't supposed to be mailing out paper checks with the second stimulus package.  The second payment is supposed to either be direct to a bank account, or in the form of the card.  Walmart cashed my first check... but I had a state ID from Washington (I am in Cali).  So... sign up for SNAP benefits, and request a State ID voucher wherever you are, and get them to help get an ID for you.  Like... now.
lah4mo,,glpa0k2,It's unconfirmed, but the people I lived with formally are sending my second one to my friends address. I asked if it was paper or card. She said paper. But I won't knew till I get it in my hand.  I would love card, paper is a pain with no id.
lah4mo,,glpbcyu,see... now I'm digging through google, and I'm finding these vague references to how some people will be mailed paper checks, and some are being mailed the debit cards... with no information on what made our government decide who will get paper, and who will get plastic.  Wtf.
lah4mo,,glpcq8r,Seriously though.
lah4mo,glq54lr,,Can someone please tell me what ‚ÄúTLDR‚Äù means? I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure it out.
lah4mo,,glq6mu7,[TLDR](https://digiday.com/announcement/introducing-tldr-new-way-read-digiday/)  That's where TLDR comes from. It's based off the Internet slang ‚Äútl;dr,‚Äù which stands for ‚Äútoo long; didn't read.‚Äù The expression is often used for short summaries of long posts. (It is, admittedly, used less courteously, but we prefer when authors use it as a way to summarize longer posts.)     TLDR  A  summary, possibly to avoid a wall of text  Edit: formatting

l9z7j0,gll3aro,,That's in Washington State. Not DC... Scroll through the whole post people!
l9z7j0,,gloof0p,Yes.   The OP is mistaken in several ways. The homeless woman and her children left the building shortly after a flash bang was heard. Several minutes later someone was brought out in a stretcher, also after flash bangs were heard. Its not yet know who was on the stretcher. They are not the same person. But flash bangs were heard just 8 minutes before the mother and children were seen outside.

l9bkxi,glh67za,,That's really cool, I haven't heard about something like this. Is it a dormitory hostel bed, or do you have a private room with bathroom within a hostel?
l9bkxi,,glh6qvn,Thanks , yes its a private room within a hostel ,it has a bedroom and living area with kitchen area all as one room then a separate bathroom with shower ,i don't have to share any kitchen or bathroom it is all self contained
l9bkxi,,glhp9sk,Wow.  Do you know what program this is?  I'm curious if others can access this resource.
l9bkxi,,glhqqub,I'm not sure what program it is ,it is a hostel that runs off public donations and people get referred here by the local council or from homeless shelter or in my case from a covid test place .Also im in the uk if that's relevant -i think other people in my city can access this program by asking at the local council housing offices or citizens advice or possibly probation ,im pretty sure there is usually a waiting list with it being upto 2 years stay  ,i guess lady luck was smiling in my direction :) edit-p.s the name of the organzation is "Nomad Trust" if thats any help

l9bkxi,h3jc5gc,,Quick question,  how did you charge your phone?   I'm happy for you. I'm sure you probably already know but you should use those 2years to get it together.
l9bkxi,,h3jfied,Hi thanks mate , I used to charge my phone either in McDonalds or the local library or local shopping centre , basically anywhere with electrical sockets , the library was best as there was no need to buy anything , Yes regarding the two years after that is up good point ,  they don't just throw people out with no place to go , they help people to get into some sort of accommodation to move on from here and make sure people have somewhere to go before they move on from here , also the company that owns this hostel also owns several shared house type accommodations that people can move to after leaving here , they are actually a really good organization,so people don't leave here homeless and back at square one
l9bkxi,,h3jftqw,It's great to know that you're on the way to a better life :). Can I ask, what's your story ? How did you become homeless? (If you don't mind of course)
l9bkxi,,h3jga0h,Yeah i dont mind ,basically it was due to covid and lost my job -so i became in debt with my landlady that i rented from and when i was out she changed the locks and illegally evicted me and so i found myself on the streets with nowhere to go and i lost all my possessions as well , thing was i was only one months rent arrears (¬£550) and i had been a good tenant for nearly 4 years then just like that she evicted me .
l9bkxi,,h3jgiol,What a crow. Thank you for sharing your story :)

l7qnz3,gl8818i,,the protestors are there for eviction defense (but also to stop homeless sweeps). Cops are there to forcibly remove homeless ppl from the streets and steal their shit
l7qnz3,gl8a07t,,This is such horse sh*t. I am so sick and tired of seeing these things happen. Just leave us alone if we are not hurting anyone/anything. Those people must get their rocks off on kicking people that are down even further.
l7qnz3,,gl8bfx8,When they did this to us, hard hat, orange vest city 'workers' were laughing while they worked. Cracking jokes, hurling insults as we scattered from under the overpass, dragging our belongings behind us.
l7qnz3,,gl8a79k,Apparently it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre sleeping in front of city hall and they‚Äôre scared they‚Äôre ‚Äúoutside agitators‚Äù which is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard and they don‚Äôt deserve that shit
l7qnz3,gl8ge3e,,Has no one ever considered setting up communes for homeless people, so they can try to get by raising crops and chickens? I can appreciate if the government doesn't have enough to provide perfect solutions but to not do ANYTHING is a crime. I mean, at least arrange for old cars to be made available so people have some kind of shelter with a door they can lock.
l7qnz3,,gl8jws3,I want local governments to merely make space available.  E.g. One street parking spot in every other street where a broke down van can sit or an un-plumbed micro shelter can be constructed.  The people can do the rest, I'd happily be constructing shelters on the weekend with my own money in those spots.   The request is really just to "do less", as in, not do what's in the reporting above.
l7qnz3,,gl8nk91,And put in properly maintained port-a-potties. Spaced out so nobody has to travel at 3 am to go.
l7qnz3,,gl8pdv1,I suspect that the ask for portapoties (one per shelter?) is enough to torpedo the entire thing (serviced portapoties would cost more than the shelters themselves and have already been shown to raise public ire).  I simply want the right to have shelter constructed by volunteers.  To the question "where are people going to use the bathroom/bathe"  my answer is "Where do they do it now while sleeping under a pile of blankets on a stoop?" I'm pretty sure that it's going to be easier when they have walls they can lock their things behind while dealing with that.  (That said, I live in crowded housing and suffice to say most of us have figured out how to use the bathroom in our rooms and deal with the product in a sanitary way).  Once there aren't any street homeless in my area and the biggest problem is bathroom access rather than the ability to sleep without getting rained on or work without having all your stuff stolen, then in version 2.0 we can address that problem.
l7qnz3,,gl8ziwj,I have to ask, what is with some homeless people destroying public bathrooms? I don't mean to come across as judgmental, but I've seen homeless people come in off the street and ask to use the facilities and when they're allowed they come out 10-15 minutes later and the bathroom looks like someone set off a bomb of literal shit. In the toilet, on the seat, on the walls, on the ground leading to the sink, in the sink...  I'm not trying to troll or anything, but I've seen this multiple times and I imagine it can't just be a single individual but it always seems to be homeless people that do this. Is there a particular mental illness responsible, is it a hatred of these places? I only ask because this might be part of the reason why cities can't\won't provide portapoties because if they're treated the same way I can't help but think the owners aren't going to be willing to clean them everytime this happens.
l7qnz3,,gl95hoo,It could be someone had to hold it in or was physically ill and just mad over the whole situation so didn't clean up after themselves . I was a janitor for several years and I worked at a federal courthouse and cleaned judges chambers and their private bathroom and a couple of them had law clerks that used the bathrooms after working hrs and would leave an absolute disgusting mess - so it's disrespectful but common on all levels of society .
l7qnz3,,gl9bxk7,I don't know.  I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that there's something about the lack of accountability and connection to the community (and providing people with a sense of place even if it's a little shack might affect that).  Of course there's also all kinds of stuff going on, if you're dirty, unslept, and unwell you might not respect your own body or the spaces around you even if you aren't suffering from a specific condition.   I've observed that folks near one of the shelters near me will just sort of walk out in the road without bothering to look.   Technically they might have some sort of right of way because cars must yield to pedestrians, but, you're very likely to get hit just sort of suddenly walking into the road.  My partner who works with homeless individuals said she thinks that has a lot to do with them getting to a place where they just don't care if they get hit and die.
l7qnz3,,glawxvl,From what I've seen, meth is the reason behind it. In my area anyways. Most homeless people who live on the street use meth where I'm at. In my hometown where I grew up half the town are meth addicts so when somebody is under the influence I just know it when I see it because I've seen it so many times before spanning from a very young age. So many times when I myself as a homeless person would be hiding out at a Starbucks, Mcdonalds, etc (pre virus) I would see somebody obviously high go in the bathroom and lock themselves in there for an hour. They'd come out and when I went in to use it the stall was totally trashed. Same deal going on at the shelter I live in now. Thankfully there are a lot of bathrooms (private locked room stalls) but every day at least 2 or 3 of them get trashed. A lot of the time I can also smell the meth through the vents from the other stalls when I'm using the bathroom. Meth makes people destructive and it also makes them act really fucking stupid.
l7qnz3,,gl9h9m3,It's not just homeless people that trash public restrooms. I used to be a janitor and people are disgusting in general.
l7qnz3,,gla966z,I cleaned an office space that required keycards to get in, couldn't have had more than 200 people there, and people would still wreck the bathrooms. Housed people do this shit too.
l7qnz3,,glap9ln,Yep. Anyone who watches the show "Hoarders" will see that they aren't showing poor people on that show. People at all income levels are gross. We are animals, after all.
l7qnz3,,gl93eej,Good question!
l7qnz3,,gl8qcv3,If it's far enough away from other communities, people could just dig a hole and put an outhouse on top of it.
l7qnz3,,gl9aj1n,Depends on the circumstances for sure.  If it's a shanty shack on someones woods in a rural area, then yeah a self/volunteer constructed outhouse does the job.   In downtown Boston that probably wouldn't go over very well.
l7qnz3,,gl9erbg,You don't necessarily go in the outhouse. You bring your thunder jug with you and empty it there.
l7qnz3,,gl9gsck,I generally think that a bucket style toilet (in the microshelter) with catchment bags could do the job and keep things mostly sanitary even in urban environments
l7qnz3,,gl9joba,There is [SlabCity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City,_California) but water is a problem.
l7qnz3,,gl9gwon,The federal government has enough money to completely eradicate homelessness. They just spend that money on the military instead. It's also why we have failing infrastructure all over the country. Our military budget is draining every other budget.
l7qnz3,,gl9qul1,I'm in favor of a lame-sounding solution because it's probably the most anybody could hope for. Wishing that the government will drop EVERYTHING and pour all money into low income housing is about all we can do there.
l7qnz3,,gl9fgpi,I'd be happy with affordable housing. On my income I'd need a roommate for a ROOM. If governments can dictate businesses not having plastic straws or not smoking in bars all in the name of health, why can't they tell these big property owners who have multiple rentals, most of the properties aren't even at 50% capacity, that they have to have a percentage of units as low income? All in the name of public health?
l7qnz3,,gl9hnw4,The government used to make public housing. It needs to get back to doing that or they need to massively expand the housing voucher/section 8 program.
l7qnz3,,gl9r9p7,I was in Evanston when they were tearing down Cabrini Green. If there's going to be public housing, for it to work, there have to be some pretty ridiculous controls over it.
l7qnz3,,glaox6b,You really think poor people are just naturally dirtier than people with money?
l7qnz3,,glazg8w,No.
l7qnz3,,gl93agq,Why do some people think the homeless are farmers-in-waiting?    That's hard dirty work and people I knew who grew up on farms couldn't get outta there fast enough.
l7qnz3,,gl94mmt,This is not a new permanent vocation, just one idea at something approaching a solution. Subsistence farming isn't easy but it's not terribly hard, either. Hell, anybody can take care of chickens.
l7qnz3,,gl9uzdt,A local shelter tried this exact approach and participation must have lasted a whole two weeks before the garden beds turned to weeds and the homeless went elsewhere.
l7qnz3,glb5m3s,,It's so dumb. Oh there's a bunch of homeless people, instead of trying to help these people not be homeless, let's steal all their shit and force them somewhere else with nothing thus putting them further into homelessness and making them start all over, or even further back than when they started, while also not reducing the number of homeless people and ensuring people stay homeless longer.
l7qnz3,gl8okmg,,This is the worst act of display against humanity. These are HUMAN BEINGS!!!! All those people ahould be sent to prison for crimes against humanity.
l7qnz3,,gl9mfta,I agree.  More worrisome is the LEVEL of L.E. they dispatched to handle "peaceful protesters" trying to keep people housed.  So now ANY protest in or near a public or government building can be deemed a "potential domestic terror threat" and SWAT and HS and ICE descend on the protest?  This is NOT why we elected Biden/Harris.  They need to IMMEDIATELY come out and denounce the excessive use of force in this matter.  I worry this is but the first step in taking away our right to "peacefully assemble for a redress of our grievances" and that is utter bullshit.  AND this absolutely does constitute CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.

l8g1m7,gld8u5r,, \>>> "For those with little or no income the premiums are free"  <<<   This is incorrect. If your income falls below the federal poverty level of $12,760, you are not eligible for any subsidies. This is the whole reason that those of us in states that have REFUSED (republicans) to expand Medicaid - cannot get any healthcare at all. When the ACA was passed, the intention was for anyone with no income or income less than the poverty level  - to be covered under Medicaid. But because of republican opposition, in 2012, the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of this - and most of the states in the south did - and because of that, I lost everything I had - my whole life savings - on health insurance premiums until I became homeless, and now it has been many years since I have had any health care at all. Haven't been to a doctor or dentist in years, no screenings, no preventive care, no checkups, no prescriptions, no treatment of illnesses and injuries. I am not an expert on many things, but I know  just about all there is to know about the whole history of the ACA and everything that has gone on with it since it was passed in 2010.
l8g1m7,,glfsqvm,Im about to lose my job but I have a 401k. It‚Äôs all I have and I‚Äôm 56. So I can‚Äôt get Medicaid unless I spend all my retirement money first. If Medicaid would allow people to have some savings and go by income only ( in states that expanded Medicaid ) it would be so much better. I checked the exchange and as long as I make at least 17k I get premiums subsidized but if I‚Äôm unemployed I get nothing. this terrifies me being 56 and on the edge of homelessness with only my 401k as savings. For Medicaid you can‚Äôt have more the 1500 in the bank.
l8g1m7,,glhk1z3,[https://www.verywellhealth.com/no-asset-tests-for-aca-subsidies-1738965#:\~:text=The%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%27s,much%20their%20homes%20are%20worth](https://www.verywellhealth.com/no-asset-tests-for-aca-subsidies-1738965#:~:text=The%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%27s,much%20their%20homes%20are%20worth).
l8g1m7,,glh6z6w,Can you point me to where you are finding this about savings and Medicaid? I thought with the expansion, they did away with any savings/asset tests and it was only based on income. In fact, I just verified this a couple of months ago. Let me take a look at where you are getting your information. Are you sure what you are finding is not old / outdated information?
l8g1m7,,glics13,I‚Äôm sure, it varies by state but the general rule is 1500 or less in savings. The expansion states do base soley on income but the asset limits are still in place. I‚Äôm in Ohio.
l8g1m7,,gliqbme,[deleted]
l8g1m7,,glixboc,You may be correct. I‚Äôm looking again and I think MAGI qualification for medical coverage may not have an asset test, it‚Äôs solely based on your monthly adjusted gross income. Looks like the assets only apply to long term care. If this is true it‚Äôs a huge relief for me but I‚Äôd have to make sure to draw no more than 12,700 a year from my 401k to be in compliance. Or work and make less than that amount. I can‚Äôt believe 12,700 is considered 138% of the poverty level. ACA subsidies for the Siover plans don‚Äôt seem to kick in until about 17k so I wonder what people who make 14k are supposed to do? It‚Äôs all so complicated
l8g1m7,,glda1l8,You do know your stuff!  Thank you for sharing your knowledge.  I'm so sorry for what you have gone through.  How shameful the US doesn't have universal coverage.
l8g1m7,,gldahvk,The outrageous and infuriating thing is that there is no reason AT ALL to refuse the Medicaid expansion. Just republicans being assholes. It literally costs the states millions of dollars to deny the coverage to the poorest people. People who aren't impacted by these policy decisions really have no idea how evil republicans are. And this was all pre-Trump. Things have become even worse, of course, recently.
l8g1m7,glcpakp,,You can sign up for Medicaid anytime of the year, it has nothing to do with the enrollment.
l8g1m7,,glctof8,What's the difference between the two?
l8g1m7,,gldjzj0,Medicaid is for the poor. Medicare is for the old. The market is for those employed.   Medicaid>medicare>exchange  Most people don't realize it but Medicaid for the poor is superior to almost all private insurance. It is functionally equivalent to the insurance Congress gives itself.  I once calculated it out that if I were to try to purchase medicaid coverage privately it would cost close to $1000/mo. for a single person.
l8g1m7,,gldl2r2,Wow üò≥ Thank you.
l8g1m7,,gldpmmx,Medicare is also for people on disability and many don't qualify for Medicaid even though they are poor because they receive more than the official poverty level .

l5mo60,gkwdcpu,,I spoke to our dmv press rep to let them know that though I was over the moon that this service was being offered, it was completely useless for individuals who were homeless because right now with covid it is damn near impossible to obtain all the other forms of id needed in order to be eligible for the I'd. Our state social workers can petition for birth certificates for homeless individuals for free, but if you weren't born here, forget it. Plus the the time it takes for everything to go through the mail. To obtain an I'd, social, birth certificate, you're looking at like 1-2 months non covid. I wish they would allow social workers to be able to petition for individuals to make it easier for people because this is literally something that is stopping some people from being able to work or obtain housing. And now, more than ever before, the risk of death is greater for that. Though I am greatful, the requirements need to change.

l46wzf,,gkn1q5k,Thanks my soulful brethren.  I couldn‚Äôt not write it. I grew up writing but I‚Äôve always had a certain je ne sais quoi dislike of poetry. I feel like I get it now. Sucks.
l46wzf,gkmzz31,,Beautiful Poem; wishing you a bright future and positive vibes
l46wzf,,gkn204c,Thank you. Saving my unemployment money. I would say what for but I wouldn‚Äôt want a bunch of Republican shitbags making us feel even worse for bootstrapping on our own tax money.
l46wzf,gknszuo,,I isolate and stare at phone never wanting to talk yet I am tired of being ignored at times
l46wzf,gkngpca,,I have always cringed when I heard people say ‚ÄúI feel you‚Äù. Absolutely cringed. They should be saying they UNDERSTAND, not ‚ÄúI feel you‚Äù.  But damn, I FEEL YOU.
l46wzf,gkn7jg0,,very poignant
l46wzf,gkot8fx,,Fuck this piece of shit society we have created. How are we the greatest country on earth when our ppl go houseless and hungry while vacant buildings are just ‚Äî there?  Sending you peace and light, praying for a better tomorrow for you and the rest of us ü´Ç
l46wzf,gkmwjrn,,Well it‚Äôs not all your fault. If we lived in a moral and transparent society from birth it might legit be your fault, but only then and if u had been given every opportunity to avoid this situation. But we know that‚Äôs not true for the average person. You may have come from a very shit beginning that leaves u more vulnerable to falling through cracks. Or not enough opportunity. Maybe u didn‚Äôt get much of a decent education and many people do not which should adequately prepare u for life.
l46wzf,,gkmx1d5,I am well aware of this but thank you for whatever that was.  Unfortunately, I'm quite well educated which just hurts me more.
l46wzf,,gkmxfp8,What do u think caused the homelessness?
l46wzf,,gkmxmbk,Have you ever had a medical situation ruin your parents life, and then your life?  Then shut the fuck up. Seriously. You wouldn't say this face to face. You'd order takeout and go home. I did too at one point.
l2wllo,gk8kmgg,,That's pretty awesome! It's great that people are still looking out for each other like that. You're in LA right, we're getting the same Pacific dump throughout next week. Should be a wet one! Stay dry Honey, I'm counting my nickles and dimes to get a new poncho.
l2wllo,,gk95kcr,I got i can mail. It's quality; not one of those dollar store ones.
l2wllo,,gk97uy9,I think mine's too cheap to sell in a dollar store ;-)
l2wllo,,gk993k6,Pm me if you have a place to get small packages. It's camo with a red zipper and really tough.
l2wllo,,gk9hrxc,Aww, you're very sweet! I'm a car dweller so no permanent address but I really appreciate it. Your generosity really made my day, I've got the warm fuzziest, thanks Honey!
l2wllo,,gk9kp2h,Not sure if this would help you but if you receive any kind of assistance from social services, some offices will let you have your mail sent to them.  Just something to maybe look into. I know in my state, Delaware, they do it.
l2wllo,,gk9lsx9,Ooo, that's interesting! I used to receive mail at a shelter but, well, nasty business there, I'm sure some people have positive shelter stories, but coronavirus was the last straw in a very bad relationship with shelters. Thanks for the advice Honey!
l2wllo,,gk9nz7t,There'a also general delivery. Only certain post offices offer it; usually the big ones.
l2wllo,,gkebblt,True. Since L.A. was mentioned, I'll mention that I can attest to the North Hollywood post office on Chandler as being general-delivery-friendly. I totally recommend that location. Good people working there, too. As long as the delivery address mentions general delivery, and it's picked up within a reasonable timeframe after it's expected, it'll be there.
l2wllo,gk8u9c8,,So awesome! Happy for you!
l2wllo,gkb0ue7,,Glad to hear you're getting help.   Hope you stay dry.
l30l2s,gk9pd37,,This is fantastic news, I am truly happy for you!  This is just the beginning of good things coming your way.  I hope the best for you, please keep us posted and thank you for sharing your good news with us!
l30l2s,,gk9ubm2,Oh I didn't think you would want to be kept posted lol But yes I'm getting closer to my dream job and I'm still homeless on paper but I'm going to get work and I have a place to stay with my friends til then. :)

l30l2s,gk9mra8,,My heart swells for you Honey! Congratulations my dear! A person with good friends is truly rich, keep and love them as your most prized possessions.
l30l2s,,gk9nxoc,Thank you! My friends are amazing and help me get so far. They were there to help me through my parents and even after with everything now. I used to get so guilty when they spent time with me to get me out the house or spent money on food to rewards on me but I learned that I deserve to be treated by my friends if they choose to and they are here to help and it's ok! :) They are very supportive of my sex work too even though they don't get what I'm talking about all the time lol
l30l2s,,gk9phax,Family is who you want it to be. Unconditional love, without judgement, without strings, that is family. That is love. It's ok if they don't fully get things or understand, all they know is that you deserve love! Honey, you are loved!!
l30l2s,gkakuuo,,Congratulations keep pushing you got this all the way.
l30l2s,,gkamx07,Yes! I'm so excited to be on the lease here and either way I am on a waiting list for permanent housing. I was offered to move in already but I couldn't because I didn't have my ID, paystub, or money to move in. :) I can now though!
l30l2s,,gkaslzk,That's so awesome. I'm really happy for you. You got this love. Keep pushing you will be all the st the top your half way to it. Keep us updated I will be waiting and rooting for you.
l30l2s,,gkat718,Thank you I finished the documents and I'm going to be training this week. I'll have to save up for the housing but I'm so excited! :D I'll update you guys. You are all so kind.
l30l2s,,gkau1k8,Think of like this you have something to look forward to your now not in the dark not knowing. Tell me how did it feel when you signed them papers? I love to see others doing great it brings joy to my heart knowing it's a light on the other side of a shitty tunnel.
l30l2s,,gkauorz,Well I didn't think too much of it to be honest the whole time I've been doing everything at once and over working myself. When we went to the office signed for it I just put my jacket down and was just meh. But my boyfriend when he came in behind me just rushed up and lifted me his face beaming. He was super excited and told me to relax and gave me a ton of kisses all over lol. I guess I'm always too busy thinking ahead I never give myself credit and think I have to do more. I was too busy thinking about what was next I am glad I had my bf there to get excited for me. It came in the mail and I was happy cuz I knew I could start work now. And I'm glad I found it so soon! :)
l30l2s,gkecujk,,Omg. This is awesome, congratulations. This post gave me so much inspiration.
l30l2s,,gkeo7n8,Oh that's great! :D I have zero regret in sharing then I'll I don't know how you would be inspired by this but I'll be honest this subreddit has links to tons of amazing resources that I am stoked to check out lol
l223rc,gk2v9p9,,I'll give you some tips.  Cut the video games. Get a trade skill in check (something "dangerous" but easy if you study, like electrician, plumber, HVAC in places, starts at 20 and can go much higher, especially with your own company). Don't do college. I repeat, don't do college unless you are absolutely sure that is the career you want for the next 20+ years. Don't listen to the counselor who will tell you to go. Do not.  Save money. If you buy pot/drugs, keep a small bit of your money aside from them and don't deviate.  Avoid alcohol at all costs. It was, and [never](https://accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kawasaki/bl142.html#jat512) will be, cool or great.
l223rc,,gk2wqbb,[deleted]
l223rc,,gk3dgbn,Lazy kid that can't motivate himself to go to do homework probably shouldn't go to college, even if he has the money.
l223rc,,gk3dx2i,[deleted]
l223rc,,gk3fa1b,> If you have the money to go to college, though, you should probably go.  My advice is at least as feasible as yours is.
l223rc,gk2slse,,Sounds like depression. Are you open to talking to a school counselor?
l223rc,gk3lsfy,,Go to job corps, they'll pay you (not very well but still money) to go to school for a trade and they guarantee a job when you graduate. Certain things like welders, plumbers, electricians, for example are very good paying jobs and have high demand for skilled workers. Maybe look into seeing a therapist as well, depression and mental illness are tough things to deal with, and the sooner you learn to cope with them and do what you can to make them better, the better your life will be
l223rc,gk2ufda,,So this, you have options. Most don't like doing homework anyways, but do you go to school? Do you put in your time? To me, that means you're capable of spending 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week on a job. (Seriously, as a high schooler, school is your "job"). You might find something you truly enjoy and want to go to college for that- grants and scholarships, limit your loans as much as possible... or you might decide college isn't for you. You might think becoming a vandweller is a better option... it's somewhat like homelessness, but you have a car. I'm in my Honda crv. I dont have it built out like others do and tbh, I don't recommend it if you don't build a bed platform. The seats do not lie down flat... but for the next 3 years, you can think of what type of car you want. Next year, you can start working and saving up for the car. Then with the van, you can travel the world, picking up odd jobs here and there... or documenting it and with you being younger (than me) knowing how to do all the YouTube stuff to where that is a job.
l223rc,gk44tzf,,Laziness alone is not the cause of most people's homelessness. People who end up homeless usually have several barriers keeping them from being able to afford housing.
l223rc,gki49pk,,Join a Boy Scout troop and they will teach you all about camping and take you places to camp. There are Venture crews and Explorer posts that you can join as well. 4H clubs, Camp fire Boys & Girls also.   Download the state driver‚Äôs license manual and study hard. Take the written test and get your learner‚Äôs permit. Some states like mine will issue a motorcycle license at age 14. Try for that as well. Having a vehicle of any kind gives you huge advantages over people who do not.   Take YMCA babysitting class and put your name up at grocery store bulletin boards and you will start making money. Take the life guard class and you can work at swimming pools all year long. Summer camps are going to be very busy and need swimming instructors.   Yard work can keep you busy making money 9 months of the year and snow removal can earn you quite a bit during the winter. Some people make good money picking up dog poop from peoples yards. Take a free Master Gardener class from the county extension office of the department of agriculture. These are often run by agricultural colleges. There is one in every county of the US.   Get a passport and passport card. Apply to study abroad. If school bores you try it in a different country. You can learn another language and culture.   Focus on reading good books. You can learn anything you put your mind to.  Get regular consistent vigorous exercise. It elevates your mood.
l223rc,gk4rsxi,,Stay focused in school. Stay out of trouble. Join the military if you need stability. You‚Äôll be fine.

l0qkx7,gki71i6,,Large used dark backpacks like UNI students carry are commonly asked for. Mountaineering backpacks stand out. Bright colors stand out. New gear makes you a target for theft.   3x3 meter camouflage tarps (Basha) are great for shelter. Cordage. Fleece blankets.   Socks are a high demand item. Gloves and warm hats like balaclava. Book of paper matches or butane lighters. Disposable hand warmers in a zip lock bag.   Water bottles.   Metal cup

kzzije,,gjr68zk,Not for me, but Mercury poisoning definitely makes me restrict my daily consumption, although I'm told the smaller Tuna don't have that problem because they don't accumulate it the same way the bigger/fatty tuna does.
kzzije,,gjrjyb4,Tuna are carnivores. The bigger they are, the more other fish they've eaten. Other fish that had mercury in *their* bodies. So it makes sense that the smaller ones would be safer.

kzzije,gjr5ki5,,Or sardines or salmon. And great to throw into whatever, rice, pasta, tortillas. They go great with saltines.
kzzije,gjrpcu3,,I want to be able to eat those. I go with the various forms of potted meats instead.
kzzije,gjrqrqc,,Keep an eye out for sales at your local supermarkets. The Acme near me currently has "10 for 10" pouches of tuna in assorted flavors, as well as salmon pouches, and tinned sardines in oil, water, mustard sauce or tomato sauce.   If you have the means to at least boil water, I suggest (carefully!) adding some minute rice and hot water to a pouch, stir, fold closed, and let it sit 5 minutes for the rice to rehydrate.
kzzije,gjr23bh,,Does it taste like tuna?
kzzije,,gjrsbcn,more akin to smoked salmon honestly but lots of  flavor cause it‚Äôs less lean
kzzije,,gjruf7r,Nice
kzzije,gjr2c9a,,Thanks for the tip
kzzije,gjs4vp3,,Just make sure if you don't have a can opener that you don't need one to open it. Ask me how I know.
kzzije,,gjs6v76,P-38 GI can opener. Walmart sells them in the camping section. Very small. I keep mine on the key ring along with a piece of hack saw blade and a ferocerium rod hot sparky from the Boy Scout shop. Hack saw blade opens cardboard boxes and saves my knife edge. I can hit it with a sharp piece of flint and throw sparks. The hot sparky is better but it is a back up. I always have a cigarette lighter in my pocket and a fresnel lens magnifier in my wallet. The other tools on my ring are an aluminum whistle and a triangular shaped church key puncture can opener. I make hobo stoves with that one.
kzzije,,gjs4yqe,did you cut yourself lol
kzzije,,gjs51op,No, but it was more like sardine paste that got eaten...also not bad!
kzzije,,gjs54a1,never tried the sardines!!!

l0alo1,gjsl4rs,,You will come up with something. Id throw out the usual advice, but its all probably just a broken record by now. So i wont bother. There is strength in you I can just tell by how you articulate your words and what you've been and are going through. I wish you the best soldier ;)
l0alo1,,gjsq19p,I appreciate it, I'm sure I'll be okay..I know a lot of folks have it a lot worse!
l0alo1,gjso36r,,Airbnb might have a cheaper weekly option. Pulling for you!
l0alo1,,gjsq6lr,thanks for the recommendation. I've searched, but honestly most of the rates in my area are the same, or only $20-50 less weekly than a hotel. The super bowl is being held here next month, so the rates are dramatically high
l0alo1,,gjsve72,Ugh that's rough. Sorry if I came off lectur-y
l0alo1,gjsy4ag,,you need to read the megathread on r/roomandboard bro...
l0alo1,gjstefd,,Contact division services or your local catholic charities to see if there is some help with deposits.

l0alo1,gjtwl1s,,I lived in Florida about 9 years ago, so i definitely understand about the housing situation. Hotel weeklies are ridiculously expensive and they do not(at least when i was there) have reasonably priced studio apartments. I ended up having roommates by calling a few ads on Craigslist. I absolutely despised having to do it, but not having much money, i was forced to do it.
l0alo1,gjvh6tu,,It's really hard to let go of that feeling of impending doom/fear of homelessness, no matter how long you've been inside.  You probably have PTSD from being homeless.   I'm sorry. You're going through this ... Everything you say is so true!  I hope things get better for you soon!   Edit: Run on sentence
l0alo1,gjskk4p,,Move into a vehicle, and live out of Walmart parking lots, and park and ride lots.  The cat?  That's a tough one.  Start getting it used to living with a harness on all the time.
l0alo1,,gjspyln,Wish I had a vehicle! Haha
l0alo1,,gju142c,Could you save up for a car or van?  The homeless report it's much easier to get by in a car than out on the street.   r/urbancarliving  Has lots of tips and instructions getting by in your car.  Life is still easier in a van  Although most of the posts in r/VanLife are by yuppies in $50k builds, there are also those with $1,500 Chevy's and a mattress in the back.  Some of those guys are thriving.  People living in vans chase the good weather to find seasonal work around the country.  Also: You should be eligible for financial aid (small scholarships, not loans) if you enroll in a Florida community college, and considerably more aid when you transfer to a Florida public university (plus loans if you want to live in a house).  Give that route some thought.
l0alo1,,goo9enp,If you lived scattered weeks of living in a tent (like 2 weeks tent, 2 weeks hotel) then you could save up some money for one months rent plus a deposit. I‚Äôd assume it would be about 1500 (1000 rent, 500 deposit). With your income you could probably achieve that in 60 days. Imagine in 60 days moving into an apartment!
l0alo1,,gjt5bjc,How's that wishing working out for you? If wishes were fishes, no one would go hungry.  Last truck I bought cost me $400 and I lived in it for a year before moving to where I live now.  You mentioned how you could live in a $1600 apartment? Imagine the freedom of living in your own mobile apartment, for only a one time payment of $800, instead of twice that every month.  No license or insurance? Don't drive like a moron, fix all the lights and exhaust, and stick to parking in places that cops won't bother you.. like those I already mentioned.  Stop wishing and take control.
l0alo1,,gjtj6yn,Nice comment.  Let's say somehow an extra $800-$1200 falls out of the sky and I manage to find some lemon that'll fall apart, or get me pulled over a dozen times a week..Cool  Now, ill just cook up the additional $450 to register and ensure it (and I'm sure my insurance rate will be excellent, because I'm driving such a "safe" vehicle)  Oh but wait, my lisence is suspended because of unpaid ticket 8 years ago, so it looks like I'll need another $600 to pay off the fine and get legal..not a big deal.   And while I do all this, I can sleep outside and freeze, just knowing that soon ill be in the comfortable back seat of a 97' Toyota..  Let's get realistic, and use a little tact when giving (unsolicited and unrealistic) advice. Living in a vehicle is a step in the opposite direction.
l0alo1,,gjtrm8d,Lol, he's real smug, isn't he? Why don't you just have more money, you would be better of that way, so it must be your fault -.-  Sad to hear that your life is falling apart again. Do you have work in your town, if not, could you try to skip to the next (hopefully cheaper) city until superbowl is over and prices are going down?
l0alo1,,gjw3c9l,And yet, we have a sub culture spread all around this country of people living in their vehicles.  Where I am now, we have "snowbirds" who live in their vehicles full time.  The come out here for the winter, and go somewhere else for the summers.  Facebook groups dedicated to Living in a Van, Rubber Tramp living, Mobile Homeless, etc.  So... actually, quite tactful to suggest you doing something that thousands of others are doing.  And YOU were the first to suggest a fanciful amount of money dropping from the sky... with the whole reference to a living in a $1600 a month apartment.  I was only using the information you provided to work with.  You built the frame of reference.  I just worked inside it.  I mean... you can say what you want.  I look around the COMMUNITY where I live, and there are people living in vehicles full time... and what you say can't work, I see work on a daily basis.  You say it is a step in the opposite direction.  I say it is a way to be able to take the money you are CURRENTLY spending on your $400 a week place, and SAVE IT to be able to afford that First and Last month's payment to get you into a better place.  You get the crap vehicle, you live in it for a few months while working (and taking showers and getting laundry done for free at one of the homeless shelters somewhere around you), and then you take the nest egg you just built to get into an $800 a month apartment in a neighborhood you are more comfortable with.  You are the one who posted to the internet of strangers about your problems... not me.  You can't say my advice is unsolicited.  And again, you can't say it is unrealistic, when I just showed you how to use my advice to get you what YOU expressed a desire for.    Sorry, Diva.
l0alo1,gjsml89,,Sounds like you've got an income though?
l0alo1,,gjspwu3,Yes, fortunately I've got some change in my pocket. 600-800 weekly may sound good butb unfortunately it doesn't get me very far in my part of the country. Especially when rent is now $400/week and food/necessities are $20/day minimum. I'm not eligible for any finial aid.
l0alo1,,gjssxwl,Hmm. Have you sat down and made a spreadsheet of your monthly spending? One suspects that there is room in that budget for some savings. I know it is hard to cook from a hotel, so beans and rice may be out, but there just has to be a way to squeeze that income to save for a deposit. Try r/frugal for ideas.
l0alo1,gju6kee,,Other options:  Can you do Air B&B?  Have you checked Facebook groups in your area for rentals that might be one room in a house for 4-500/month?
l0alo1,,gjvqfnz,Airbnb monthly is great!!! Ive been using my stimulus checks to stay in them
l0alo1,,gkzejz5,Is airbnb monthly different than airbnb? Even tiny rooms in peoples houses seem to be $900-$1700 a month when I put in 30 days but maybe that's just in my city
l0alo1,,gkzeyax,Yes it‚Äôs different. Youll get a significant discount by choosing the monthly option. Slide the search filter to only look at places within your budget. I rented a place in Houston for 600/month and a place in DC for around 800.
l0alo1,,gkzfjgz,wow that would be amazing,  I'm in Tampa and unfortunately the Super bowl is HERE next week lol..so even the room im staying in is going to be $400/night. Luckily,  I think I'm paid up for 2 weeks so now that I know that I'm going to save up every penny and in 2 weeks I'll book one of those.  That's a life changer, thanks
l0alo1,,gkzfz12,Yer welcome
l0alo1,gjv97jj,,Congrats on staying clean out there.  Good for you.  Maybe a change of scene is in order.  Try somewhere new for the summer months?     Florida is the pits.  I know every city has it's disadvantages though.  You know best.
l0alo1,gjtyvga,,Buy a cheap car and keep flipping it until you can buy a van.
l0alo1,gjvbn9h,,I got a book from the library... How to live in a car, van, rv and live the good life. Something like that. I was actually planning to live this way for about a year to save up all my meager income, but a better solution presented itself. My it's my backup plan if my current one doesn't work out.   Bottom line, you have to have a plan.
l0alo1,gjxnxno,,Work either a full time job or two part times if you are only working one part time right now. I know because of covid it may be harder but keep searching nonetheless. Find a roommate as well. Pay your rent, buy groceries you need necessities and save the rest if you can. Try seeking out resources. Many resources are hidden and you have to search to find them but they are there.

kze5cz,gjou6e3,,Cheers. Enjoy
kze5cz,gjpmfvb,,Yay how awesome!! I‚Äôm glad you got a blessing like that! Enjoy and stay safe as well!‚úåÔ∏è
kze5cz,gjpzs1b,,AWESOME ENJOY YOU DESERVED IT!
kze5cz,gjozqnj,,I'm going to sound like a complete jerk, but sometimes I miss the years I was homeless, if only because I appreciated moments like this more than I ever thought possible.   Happy for you bud. I hope things continue to look up for you, stay cozy.
kze5cz,gjp36m3,,Enjoy... :)
kze5cz,gjp9dhq,,Me too!! It's nice huh?
kze5cz,gjp9yba,,Congrats man!
kze5cz,gjpbhbj,,Sweet!!! Enjoy
kze5cz,gkvhxnx,,I love football! What do you think of Wayne Rooney?(soccer)
kze5cz,gmww22x,,Just read this post and wanted to check up to see how you were doing OP. If you could respond I sure would love it. I genuinely care
kyuszr,gjivjse,,I would like them
kyuszr,gjix1tx,,Sooo kind of you!
kyuszr,gjje2fu,,At the amazon warehouse they give these to drivers and workers for free they have huge tubs of them
kyuszr,,gjjfgbx,It would be nice if Amazon workers do what I‚Äôm doing!
kyuszr,gjjgcgc,,What do these do?
kyuszr,,gjji9fd,These are hand warmers. They‚Äôre basically heating pads that you can use for your hands or really anywhere that will stay warm for a good amount of time before they lose their heat and go cold. Once they go cold there‚Äôs no way to rejuvenate their heat unless you microwave them. They usually last a while
kyuszr,,gjjknfq,Interesting... how does it even activate?
kyuszr,,gjk19rm,It‚Äôs iron and activated carbon and you shake it to mix them and then they combine and draw water from the air in an exothermic rusting reaction.  Basically super fast rusting that creates heat as a byproduct.
kyuszr,,gjjt8bw,Squeezing them  would allow them to begin to heat up. However, some of them have buttons that you press that allow them to manually warm up that way
kxo19d,gjdugt4,,I would stop telling people where you hide your money! Seriously though, call 211, find your way to a shelter, or if you have a car you can sleep there with a sleeping bag or a bunch of blankets. Sign up for SNAP/EBT and in the mean time seek out your nearest/open soup kitchen and food pantries. Good luck Honey, keep us updated as to how you're doing!
kxo19d,,gjf2s88,Ohhh Im fine SeaTac for now.. I was homeless for ALL of 2020. Corona Class of 2020. No car, nobody to help me out, lying on my backpack on the concrete with various blankets from time to time up here on Newport Blvd in Costa Mesa...I was saved last month by a nice family that has given me a room in their house with no real obligations or rent to pay. Yeah no joke. Theres a long back story how it came to be, but miracles do happen...   I was just trying to start a game or get a rise from people if they find themselves on the dawn of doom as to what they would do. Thanks for your concern though üòò
kxo19d,,gjfcdb6,Shoot. I even started with the cute answer, should have held on and told you to bet it all on black. Oh well, happy to hear you're warm and safe. Lots of love and luck in the new year Honey!
kxo19d,,gm6e67h,Thaks so much ;)
kxo19d,gje986e,,No relation.
kwrihi,gj80z3d,,I'm living proof of this. I recovered from a heroin addiction more than a year ago. Once I finally got sober, I literally had nothing. I basically forced myself to work fast food minimum wage jobs, but could never get ahead. I remember time would go by, month by month and no progress was being made. these little $250 paychecks were not even coming close to helping me reestablish myself. My addiction took me to such bad places that I literally didn't have clothes. To get by, I had to wear stuff that was three sizes bigger than what I needed. I had no money to eat. Unfortunately, and I'm not proud of this, I had to steal food from my roommates just to get by. I hate that I did that but I felt like I had no other options.  There was a few things I needed to do to get my life back on track. One of them was handle a court case that I had so I could legally get a better job. The way things were, I could only work at places that didn't do a background check because I had an active warrant. In order to take care of that active warrant, I had to complete my obligations to the court, pay for my lawyer, and pay for travel up north. Each of those which required having money.  Long story short, there were a lot more things I need to do to truly recover and hit the reset button on my life. I lost a lot during my addiction and even a year later, I still didn't put a dent in reestablishing my life. I had dug myself in so deep of a hole that it would have taken 30 of those little $250 paychecks to get my life back on track.  Well, finally a family member gave me $6,000 and I've been able to get some clothes that actually fit, which has helped me look more presentable for job interviews. (Imagine someone shows up to a decent paying job interview wearing a quadruple XL shirt when they are really a medium and tell me if you would hire that person) I was able to get transportation so I could complete my community service for the court. I was able to get copies of my high school diploma so I could apply for college. I was able to establish a bank account (because things got so bad that I literally had nothing. No Bank account, no clothes, I didn't even have an ID. When I say nothing I mean nothing. I had pretty much everything I had when I was first born. the only difference is that when I was first born I was given a birth certificate and I didn't even have that at this point)  That $6,000 saved my life.  I'm so tired of hearing people say to these homeless people "just get a job" because in a lot of cases just getting a job isn't going to cut it. In a lot of cases these people need about 10 paychecks worth of money just to get back on track.  I'm living proof that this works. When that family member gave me $6,000, that was roughly 30 paychecks worth what I would get at a fast food job. And notice most people who are homeless are working those kind of jobs or at least a blue collar job. I've been homeless before and I've met people in the homeless community and not one of them had a white collar job. And the reason no White collar people go homeless is because one paycheck is enough for them to reestablish themselves.  For blue collar people, they're getting by paycheck to paycheck, just barely able to pay everything. And then one small thing happens, and they lose their place and their job and now they can't pay their car and all of these consequences lead to more consequences and before you know it the cost to bail one out of that situation has equaled to many times what one normal paycheck is to them.  And that is the fundamental problem we have in this country. News flash: it's not about accountability and getting a job. It's about wealth class and how much you make. I don't care how good someone is with money and how great of a financial planner they are. There is no way to save yourself into wealth and there is no way to financially plan so you don't become homeless. Not when you have a blue-collar job   and that's so far has allowed me to fix my legal troubles {comma} reestablish myself {comma} and now I'm applying to get into college.
kwrihi,gj6h0rv,,Dude, it took half a year to get some people $600. Do you have to prove you're a Canadian citizen because I'll swim across from Seattle for $5,800.
kwrihi,gj6ktxw,,Meanwhile in the US the media is reporting that there will be an increase in opiod overdose because folks will spend their money on drugs.   Man to live where people actuallly trust people.
kwrihi,gj6ho01,,Wish i had that money
kwrihi,gj7001p,,Impossible here because people worry too much about money once it leaves their own hands.
kwrihi,gj6hrua,,This article has been posted and reposted so much it's starting to feel like propaganda. Yes, it would be great if the completely unsurprising results became a catalyst for UBI, but nobody is going to implement that sort of thing here in the US. The objective here is for those who fall off the grid to die as quickly as possible.
kwrihi,,gj6ie9n,It's been tried in Stockton, CA with mixed results
kwrihi,,gj816hz,You know, it's that kind of thinking that reinforces that it'll never happen. Never say never. If things continue to regress in the way that they have been in terms of how horrible things are for blue collar workers, homeless people, and drug addicts, eventually there is going to be a point where US policy shifts to a very liberal direction and we quickly reach the level of Scandinavian governments. I give it 30 to 100 years and that will happen. At the point where anyone who has a blue-collar job is on the street and homeless, there's just going to be a point where the government will have no choice but to make things better.
kwrihi,gj85e2z,,When the money runs out then what? Who keeps paying their rent if they decide which ALOT do to not get a job. I'm all for a hand up not a hand out. Growing up in the projects people are proudly unemployed and the first of the month is celebrated like a holiday because of all the free government benefits here in the states come in. The more babies you have the more welfare, I even seen moms encourage their teenage daughters to have kids for extra cash, ebt, wic, utilities paid, free vehicles, They got it made. Job hunting is never on anyones agenda either. When i suggest getting a job the excuses roll out and even get pissed at me. People who honestly try should get help first and foremost not people who just refuse and are comfortable living that way.
kwrihi,gj81pas,,from the article:  For someone who just became homeless, who does not have a severe level of substance use or mental health issues, then the government should distribute a one-time cash transfer to help them move out of homelessness quickly.‚Äù says Zhao  well, state and local governments do something similar. it's not 6gs deposited in a bank account with no strings attached, but in the form of section8 vochers, TANF, EBT, etc.  But this is Vancouver. I can't imagine this working in say, LA county or NYC.
kwkjeq,gj6lpuw,,Same here...never received either of them. And since i live overseas, calling them and waiting so long to talk to an actual agent is not an option. I recently did my tax returns for 2020...claimed both stimulus checks on the recovery rebate credit. May not get it, but figured it was my only option.
kwkjeq,,gj76k4y,Seems to be so. Isnt right.
kwkjeq,gjgg0l7,,Just an idea. Contact you local State representative and see if they can get the ball rolling for you. Ive dealt with people and businesses who use the covid as an excuse. Keep us updated if this helps.
kvvfso,gj0tj2w,,Germany. Citys: munich m√ºnchen and berlin lots of shelters and people give good money
kvvfso,gj1wdah,,To clarify: You are asking which country in Europe you can move to in order to take resources from the homeless in that area, be allowed to be homeless without anyone harassing you and also in the event you die, be able to stick it to the taxpayers too or be able to die at a discount?  Does that about sum up what you are asking?
kvvfso,,gj30vm4,>to die at a discount?  That's a funny way of saying- " to escape death tax/rules".
kvvfso,,gjcjb5y,> stick it to the taxpayers   Well, I was a tax payer too, but anyway, the rich and pro-lifers must pay for those who can't handle life anymore
kvvfso,,gjck5pn,Yes, blaming the rich.  It's a classic.
kvvfso,,gjcp4bx,Government should tax the rich as much as possible, to cover the costs of keeping all homeless people alive for free, or help die for free. This world mess was created by rich people. So they must pay for their irresponsibility, for generating too many poor people and homeless
kvvfso,,gjcpug3,I guess it comes down to how you define rich.  Most taxes are paid by regular people, rich people have options, including changing nations to protect their wealth.  I am not sure how paying more taxes will help the homeless as governments have decided that the poor and indigent are a blight and treat the programs for homeless as such.  The only way to really help the homeless is for people to decide that they have had enough and start helping the homeless that want to be helped.
kvvfso,,gjcs9l4,I don't think so,   the rich, whitch is 1% that has the most wealth, they must pay for all this mess, I mean crazy irresponsible people like Bill Gates, Bezos, Zuckenbrg, Google, and others
kvvfso,,gjcsqxj,Good luck with that.  If you take their money and put it in the hands of the government, the government will form a new department to help the homeless, hire a bunch of people to run it, say it's a success because they all worked hard and spent a lot of tax money, but in the end, the homeless people that need the help received none.  The resources will be eaten up by the homeless industrial complex while they pat themselves on that back at their annual gala dinner.
kvvfso,,gjcuml3,Nooo,   Just tax the rich and then government takes responsibility to give free money to homeless.   For example, if in Germany, then:  \- 10$ /day for food per homeless capita,   \- free small room (9-12square meters), including service bills, with specific rules.  If a homeless person becomes aggressive  or abuses the service than they can be put in special cages  as punishment for their actions.  This way there will be no homeless walking around.
kvvfso,,gjcuucs,Maybe you should have just gone to Germany and live off their government.  Sounds like an ideal situation for you.
kv8ehp,gixbuxo,,Haha, even that barrel is smiling for you, indeed a good day!
kv8ehp,gix7ija,,Score! You find that in the trash?
kv8ehp,,gix7m92,on the ground
kv8ehp,,giy254z,People are idiots, take advantage of their dumbasses every chance you can
kv8ehp,giyc1u3,,I said *good day*, sir!
kv8ehp,,gizf8kx,Lol Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?
kv8ehp,,gizg8iz,You know.
kv8ehp,giy64fg,,Lookin good
kv8ehp,giy5a6m,,Those coin things still exist, huh?
kv8ehp,,giy5epn,yeah and some of us really need them
kv8ehp,,giy5t1k,No doubt, every cents counts. For those in Seattle, I have an open offer for a beer and pizza/burger/sandwich and a decent contact/friend who has been around the block!
kv8ehp,giytvdu,,I detest the penny and make it an active mission to either tell people to keep the change or dispose of them myself.
kv8ehp,,giyvk9c,You're really going to post this comment on the comment of a homeless person who has been searching the ground for any change they can find? SMFH
kv8ehp,,giyyjcs,Seriously
kv8ehp,,giz16sl,I'm homeless myself jackass, get off your high horse, some of us don't care to literally pinch every penny, if you do, good for you, you guys really love jerking yourselves off over literal pennies, it's because of people like me that you find those pennies on the floor jfc being homeless doesn't mean not being able to have a different opinion.  https://www.thebalance.com/get-rid-of-the-penny-4178219 Feel free to educate yourselves or keep downvoting bandwagon, Im not here to get bullied out of my own belief to make you feel good, by your logic everyone should account every single penny like the IRS and not leave a single spare cent for someone like OP to have even 32 cents to be happy about, because people who think pennies aren't worth their weight or even commonly accepted  don't exist right? minus a coin change machine or a take/leave a penny but congrats Reddit fedoras keep tipping each other.
kv8ehp,,gizebqs,You are so sweet!
kv8ehp,,gj09czz,it cost more to make a penny than the penny itself is actually worth but to get rid of it would be to raise the prices on everything instead of a burger costing $1.42 now it costs 2$ cuz its not like they are going to lower the prices thanks for killing the dollor menu but do please keep throwing your change on the ground like a wastefull idoit ill take it
kv8ehp,,giyymkd,Put your money where your fat gob is then.
kv4gr3,giwkkvs,,Accurately described my good pr0noun.
kv4gr3,giwrwe7,,Back in the day when I was homeless, A 5th of R&R or BV and whatever change I could get from pan handling at the local gas station+mini mart would get me through the day and I could bear to interact with the public at my own discretion (I hated social interaction) and I'd sleep down by the river. Wash rinse repeat. I never disclosed where I would sleep and wouldn't talk about my situation to anyone so I understand that, you are like minded. I would spend my day at the River mostly getting drunk and posing for photos with the tourist paddle boarder girls and to them I was just the tan hippy dude that got drunk and lives on the beach and that's how I liked it. Much better position in life now after getting sober and going through many trials and tribulations, Thank the good Lord. Hope everything works out for you.
kv4gr3,,gixqzqv,Ever read a book, "The Basketball Diaries"?
kv4gr3,,gixu83o,Never. I'll check it out, you recommend it, I take it?
kv4gr3,,gizaxnh,Highly recommend.
kv4gr3,gix40du,,FFS, sorry OP, and I agree, I never volunteered that I was homeless to anyone, and I'm sorry that you've been dealing with this, ugh!  I had crashed in my car in a neighborhood once, I heard the maintenance people starting to work so crawled from the back to get in front and drive off and there was a cup of coffee sitting on the hood of my car which I'm sure one of the workers left for me, just being gracious, but it freaked me the fuck out (female), and I couldn't have driven out of there fast enough and I also never went back because NOW someone knew I was sleeping in my car.  I *feel* your frustration.  Self-serving, yeah, that sounds about right, not for you, but for them  *rolls eyes*.    Good luck OP.  *Hugs*...  <----- but from a distance.  ;)
kv4gr3,,gj1i92r,I've found a few people sleeping in there cars at work as long as noones near the door making a mess or causing attention I don't care (I'm susposed to lol) but I have left breakfast for some of my outdoor guests normally with a note explaining my feelings and the shifts i work. But let's face it when in my geo I would of loved some no cook sealed shelf stable goodies
kv4gr3,giwonk4,,Doesn‚Äôt matter how somone shouts from the rooftops how much they don‚Äôt blame the poor or homeless if they find out you are both or either or have been you are not their friend but a charity case so childlike you are like a baby yet so criminal you can‚Äôt be trusted.  &#x200B;  ‚ÄòNext time, don‚Äôt tell anyone
kv4gr3,,gix1m9a,Exactly.  They act like you can‚Äôt be trusted to do the right thing, either. Ironic on so many levels.  Should‚Äôve kept it to myself, yes.
kv4gr3,,gix5hig,I understand why you didn‚Äôt! They belIve their own bullshit so you do, too.  Ive just heard the bullshit too many times, I know to keep my mouth shut. Most people are incapable of changing their minds when presented with new evidence.   Try to find new unlikely friends. One thing that shocked me as I got older was the amount of people who seem grumpy or ‚Äúshort‚Äù but if you get to know them are quite nice!  I‚Äôm not saying there aren‚Äôt asshats like that too, but we tend to think a grumpy type is not kind when often it just means they got burnt and don‚Äôt try anymore.
kv4gr3,,gixa3ip,>They act like you can‚Äôt be trusted to do the right thing  Yes exactly, the irony of them acting in a morally bankrupt manner while simultaneously treating you like the criminal.   A big comeuppance is needed.
kv4gr3,,gixqvm7,Your 'condition' is 'not their problem'. II've seen that enough times. Everyone is so sorry for your plight (whatever got you there) but ultimately they aren't responsible for you, have enough 'problems' of their own.  Its justification they make to not have to get involved beyond  a shallow, keeping up appearances, sake.
kv4gr3,,gixru1p,Huh? Was that a response to me?   If so, not sure how it relates. OP was talking about people who force their way into your business. And when I was homeless I also rarely told anyone, just like other commenters.
kv4gr3,,gixs7dk, I agree with you, was adding to the 'bankrupt morality' part.
kv4gr3,gix49wj,,I agree with alot of what you're saying but help me understand something you don't want help? Like I'm not being an arse here, I care deeply about this issue and really want to understand it. Yes they have been rude but could this not be them 'changing' their mind or trying to do what they think is best to help you, again not saying that I support this idea but I juts want to understand it better.
kv4gr3,,gix8uzz,I have been in OPs shoes. The things their friends are "offering" are not what they need. But when they ask for what they need they get shit from their friends. The friends only want to give items useless to OPs needs and expect OP to be fucking grateful.  They are leaving him or her items they already have or don't want. When I was homless I needed a place to take a shower. I needed a safe place to sleep.    Giving me your old clothes isnt what I need. I had plenty of clothes.I had friends offer me food that needed refridgeration. What the fuck am I to do with this milk? Or deli meat?    Both my sisters would invite me for sleep overs for fun when I had housing as soon as I was homeless oh no I cant sleep on their couch what will the nieghbors think?    Friends would lecture me like I was a retarded child about being responsible when I was homeless. I was not homeless because of irresponsible behaviour. I was homeless because I did not have enough income to live in our city, after I became disabled.    I have worked since I was 13. I am now medically retired and my social security isnt enough to live on. The only reason I am housed now is because I finally got on the Section 8 program. I get foodstamps. I go to the food bank every single month. I have no money for extras.   When I was HOMELESS my sister gave me a $300 Coach handbag. Lovely hand bag but seriously?  And I wasnt allowed to shower or do laundry at her house. Five bedrooms two bathrooms the house we all grew up in.
kv4gr3,,gixl35s,Thank you so much for helping me understand and taking the time to write all of this and further more being so candid and vulnerable about your experience I really appreciate that. It sounds as though people's friends and families are prepared to do the material donation but forget about the other needs of the person in a sense acting on them rather than listening to them and acting in concert with them to help lift them up. I hope I have understood this right, thank you so much once again.
kv4gr3,,gixln2u,You are welcome.
kv4gr3,,gixj4d8,This sounds so close to my own experience like no I don‚Äôt need food I need to sleep for 5 hours safely. The ironic part is as a homeless person you can get free stuff so easy everything but a safe place to sleep or a place to put stuff. And people Are like o don‚Äôt give homeless people money I donate it!  Great, a free McMuffin which I would have to buy anyway so I could use the bathroom
kv4gr3,,gixlrfm,Hugs.
kv4gr3,gix83of,,Sorry about your situation friend. People can be indescribably cruel or incredibly kind. I don't wish this life on anyone, but I feel that everyone would benefit from walking a mile in our shoes.
kv4gr3,gixlglx,,There is a big, self righteous response to the raid at the homeless encampment near Capitol Hill. And I was thinking..if only you self righteous pricks would pay a living wage and 5 cents more in taxes, you wouldn't have to be reminded how shit the society you live in is.   I get sick of the excuses people make. We no longer provide basic needs for the disabled, but refuse to say how eugenic it is to have them out on the street when there's no way in hell anyone would ever hire a person in a wheelchair. Lefty trustifairians are even kicking disabled and low income elderly out on their asses in RV communities to build hipster "tiny home communities".   Our society is collapsing and I have no sympathy for the people who currently benefit from it. I don't like those destructive Trump cultists, but FFS I know where they're coming from, even if they've chosen the wrong targets. It's far more malicious to understand fully what's wrong with society and do nothing or justify why you should do nothing and benefit from others' pain.
kv4gr3,,gj2c18q,Why are you blaming the left, when you should be blaming the true destroyers?  The rich capitalists. And please don't start with that left supports the rich crap. The problem is that we are ignoring the deregulation of american law, so we can favor keeping the rich rich. Don't support Trump or his rioters. Trump didn't do anything for anyone in his four years as president, except make corporations almost tax exempt.
kv4gr3,,gj3me1t,That's a predicable view from tight spoonfed filters and echo chambers. As for "left", most self identified leftists I've ever met in person were the snobbiest, classist assholes I've ever met. They're part of the very elite you've been programmed to think they oppose. I've met plenty of racist right wingers, and becauase their out in the open, they're easy to avoid. But most of the gentrifiers I've met made people homeless, then identified themselves as those working class people they just put out on the streets because "they moved into edgy, rustic neighborhoods".
kv4gr3,,gj4qt53,To say they are all left is a generalization. You've met a few lefty gentrifiers. You meet a few right wing gentrifiers. My point is the rich are the problem. Gentrifiers are not rich. They are poor and in debt, just not as poor as the homeless and renters. The rich are the folks that don't have to gentrify. They can live where they want, and don't have to worry about poverty. Our very existence is to feed the rich, and We gotta fight back.
kv4gr3,,gj5gu7r,\---Gentrifiers are not rich  What they are doing is neocolonialism. They operate in tandem with real estate developers, who write/revise/dictate zoning laws and ordinances, creating barriers to entry via the real local government, the Chambers of Commerce, who operate in tandem with [hedge funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-14/blackstone-said-to-boost-mobile-home-bet-with-550-million-deal) . Yes, gentrifiers are rich. The end goal of putting a hipster snob in a poor neighborhood is to raise property value to extract more money from real property. Seeing as you defend them, your call to fight is destined to fail, and is only lodged to conveniently blame those who are poorer than you for not serving the agenda. You value forcing persona over solving real world problems.
kv4gr3,,gj5lr3q,I don't think gentrifiers are that well organized. And they are far from rich. No one moves into a shitty neighborhood or a shitty house unless you have a shitty amount of money.
kv4gr3,gix1bvn,,Well, at least you have "friends" ... The question you must ask yourself is... If I had always been privileged like them, and never had to face homelessness... Would I recon that toxic part of them?
kv4gr3,giyceqb,,That's so awful. But then, people generally suck. Especially when it really comes down to it. That's when people show their true colors...   I'm not homeless but finding a job is hard, more so than ever in covid. I just want to be independent, finally independent of other people's handouts and feeling beholden to others. I wish the best for you... I hope you manage to find a job.
kv4gr3,giwu7m3,,>Again, I knew being honest would lead to bad outcomes, so I gently avoided their questions.  Being honest with people doesn‚Äôt automatically lead to bad outcomes. Maybe it would, sure. But by avoiding the problem you‚Äôve just exacerbated it and led to your being cut off from your friends who just wanted to help.   > They probably feel good about themselves, dropping random stuff they think I need on my car. Of course, they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to actually ask what I need: a good job.   Or maybe they couldn‚Äôt provide you with a job so they did what they could because they care about you and instead of being grateful you thought you‚Äôd be a dick about it.  It‚Äôs your own shame about your situation that‚Äôs the problem and it‚Äôs turning you against the only people who actively want to be in your corner.
kv4gr3,,gj2dpqp,Sorry, but I agree with op. When they found out op was homeless, they started treating op like a homeless person. No more sleep overs or house parties, and I bet when op did hang around his friends, they started only asking him charity questions like "are you alright?" or "how you feeling". Op can remember days where these questions never occurred. Days when it was just friends having fun. Now they are probably treating him like a 3rd wheel. Now it's more like "was I invited because they feel sorry for me?" Screw those guys. They don't really care about you. It's gonna be hard, but you gotta start over. If you can, I suggest going somewhere far away from them. Reinvent your life. The old days are gone.
kv4gr3,,gj5b579,> No more sleep overs or house parties  I think you‚Äôre projecting a bit much there. OP said nothing about sleep overs or house parties. And really? Sleep overs and house parties? If you‚Äôre a person young enough that sleep overs are still a thing that makes or breaks friendships, I‚Äôm very sorry you‚Äôre going through this so young. It sucks. I hope you find some help off the street before you‚Äôre too acclimated and can never find your way out. If you‚Äôre an actual adult, please start thinking about things like an adult. You‚Äôre never going to get straight if your primary concern when choosing friends is ‚Äúdo they want to party with me?‚Äù  > asking him charity questions like "are you alright?" or "how you feeling"  Those questions are how people show concern. My friends and I ask each other those things all the time whenever we are going through hard times *because we care about each other*. I don‚Äôt mean to play head shrinker but I‚Äôm starting to think you might have grown up in a family who didn‚Äôt express much love or support.   Rejecting people who show interest or concern over your well being because you‚Äôre concerned about receiving ‚Äúcharity‚Äù is a good way to stay on the street with no real friends. The definition of charity is ‚Äú2. the voluntary giving of help, typically in the form of money, to those in need. 3. kindness and tolerance in judging others.‚Äù   The most fundamental reason to have friends is not to party. It is to have a support system of people who care about you - who want the best for you and are *concerned* when things are going bad for you. Partying and having fun is great but if a friend doesn‚Äôt worry about you when you‚Äôre homeless then they‚Äôre not really a friend. They‚Äôre just a person you party with.  I know it sucks to have people worry about you. It‚Äôs embarrassing. It can make you feel ashamed. But that‚Äôs a thing you have to take care of in yourself - not in the people who worry about you. Of course they worry. Of course they want to know if you‚Äôre okay. You‚Äôre homeless. That‚Äôs hard and fucking dangerous. I was homeless for two years and came out fine yet when another friend of mine lost his apartment and started living in his car I was worried about him all the time.  > Now they are probably treating him like a 3rd wheel. Now it's more like "was I invited because they feel sorry for me?" Screw those guys. They don't really care about you.  If they didn‚Äôt care about you they wouldn‚Äôt invite you along. You‚Äôd just get ghosted. People who don‚Äôt care *don‚Äôt care*. Yeah, it might not be the same and you might feel like a 3rd wheel. But that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre homeless and that‚Äôs a pretty big elephant in any room.  So they feel sorry for you. So what? You‚Äôre homeless. Does it not suck? It sucked complete ass for me. Why would they not feel sorry for you?  Now, whether or not these are the friends you (or OP) need caring about you is another thing entirely - maybe they‚Äôre shitty in other ways. I have no idea. But to write people off for wanting to know how you are and inviting you along, despite the fact that it‚Äôs uncomfortable? You‚Äôre only hurting yourself.
kv4gr3,,gj5ldnu,You strike me as one of those formerly homeless guys that forgot what it was like being homeless, and just brags about being ex homeless. But that a side, I'd say the only real mistake op made was telling them he was homeless. This bought out their "nurturing" side, which is really the fear of being homeless.
kv4gr3,,gj7jzbu,> You strike me as one of those formerly homeless guys that forgot what it was like being homeless, and just brags about being ex homeless.  Who brags about being ex homeless? Like, what‚Äôs to brag about? ‚ÄúMan, one time I fucked up my life so bad I lost all my friends and slept next to a guy who smelled like pee! Rad, right?‚Äù  You don‚Äôt forget what it was like being homeless, no matter how long ago it was. It‚Äôs like high school or a bad relationship - those things don‚Äôt leave you.  It‚Äôs been over a decade and when I‚Äôm walking around I still spy out alleyway nooks and places in the brush where I could sleep, just out of habit. I have a family now and take my son - in normal times - to music lessons at the guitar center I used to sleep behind. They‚Äôve put fence around the cubby hole by the loading dock where I used to crash sometimes. I think about it every time we‚Äôre there.  But one of the things I remember most is discovering that I didn‚Äôt have any real friends at the time. All the people I thought were real friends for years and years? They completely fucking disappeared. There were no check-ins or misguided gifts left on my car. Me being homeless was too much for them and they just fucking shut me out. I don‚Äôt blame them. I was a mess. Once I got my shit back together and made a new life, we‚Äôve been back in touch. Not like the old days but they‚Äôve apologized for abandoning me and that‚Äôs enough for me. I‚Äôm pretty forgiving.  But I absolutely remember what that felt like. Being completely alone. Not having a single close friend.  And I remember that I would not have made it if I had not had help from people who were practically strangers. People who gave me blankets and shoes when I had none. One who barely knew me from a coffee shop, who would let me sleep on the floor of his one room apartment and use his shower sometimes. The other guy from a different coffee shop who loaned me his old car to sleep in for two months during the winter. The people who would buy my drawings so I could eat..  I had to rely on the *charity* of people who were nearly strangers to me because the people I had thought were friends couldn‚Äôt be bothered to look at me anymore. And I get it - those people only knew me as this homeless guy so for some reason it was less shameful. It wasn‚Äôt like we had history together that I was reminded of whenever I used their shower or ate their food or whatever. Maybe that would have felt worse from the people who had known me when I wasn‚Äôt homeless. But I‚Äôll never know because those people were not there.  So if you or OP have friends who actually want to help - who feel compelled to give you a hand - it is my considered opinion that you‚Äôre being prideful fuckups to chase them off. If your friends ask you ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù instead of avoiding your calls and pretending they aren‚Äôt home when you stop by? You genuinely don‚Äôt know how lucky you are. Or what an asshole you are for hating them for it.  We all need help. No one can do it alone. It‚Äôs *your* shame and embarrassment that makes you feel like people are being self serving by trying to help you out.  I‚Äôm not saying this to berate you or make you feel bad or make myself feel good or to try and feel ‚Äúcool‚Äù about the good old days when I didn‚Äôt know what I was going to eat or where I was going to sleep.   It is because I honestly care about you and OP as fellow human beings. And it makes me sad to see people who have been so unloved that they can‚Äôt even trust anyone or accept help and concern from their friends. And I know you won‚Äôt listen to me now but I just hope you do someday. There are just as many people out there who want to help you because they just want to help you as there are people who just want to use and exploit you because they only care about themselves. I hope that you someday get to know the difference. Because that is going to be a huge step toward happiness and being well.
kv4gr3,,gixru7w,I think the point was not that they should have given him a job but that they should have asked what he needed instead of dropping off random unusable things that he would have to throw out. I am currently living out of my car and if someone gave me something I didn't need that I would have to throw away I would feel ungrateful but I would have no choice. The generosity I would have to decline would make me feel like shit. So probably better to not give anything then to push a depressed person into further depression.
kv4gr3,,gixx5dz,My point is not that OP should be happy with what they are given but that they should be happy that they have people around who want to give in the first place because those friends are at least TRYING. All this would just be a lot clearer and easier if OP would just talk to their friends honestly about their needs - both personal autonomy AND help - and stop getting mad or embarrassed when they try to help.   I fucking get it, being homeless is embarrassing. Accepting help is embarrassing. I was homeless for almost two years and I rejected as much help as I possibly could because I was embarrassed that someone might pity me.  But the fact is OP has a group of friends who have shown active interest in A. Continuing their friendship. B. Helping.   Not a lot of people have that. And it is to OPs own detriment to reject it because they are having self esteem issues. So the friends aren‚Äôt going about it the right way? The only person who can fix that is OP. Their friends aren‚Äôt psychic.
kv4gr3,giznhap,,What area are you in? Id love to help you find a job if I can.
kv4gr3,,gj00abj,I‚Äôm in nyc and not homeless any jobs for me?  Edit: by this I only meant how the fuck is a homeless person supposed to deal with work when sleep is hard to get?  Yet that‚Äôs all people want so they can feel like that person is ‚Äúworthy‚Äùof having human needs met.   Like being homeless makes u deserve to not sleep, which is a form of torture by the way.  I see how someone could read it to mean I think I‚Äôm Better for being housed but that‚Äôs not what I mean at all- rather, being hosed is a luxury I currently have, and would love to keep so if anyone has work that would be great.

kuab9i,gj115hq,,The saying "Money doesn't buy happiness" is 100% true, but what is left out is "stress steals from your happiness, and money alleviates stress".  I have experienced both poverty and windfalls. Now I am fortunate enough to say that me and my family do not have financial stress now, but I have not forgotten how sleepless past nights have been, or the strain (at one point homelessness)  of what have too little funds bring.

kthjus,,giqdlji,Why don't u somehow try to complete your high school education or get a GED...I have read your posts and know your history...You are one brave girl... specially how u took care of your sister despite all odds...I believe u r a smart girl...If u can survive the streets then u can survive and do anything...You are young...try to complete your education... Slowly opportunities and your confidence and interest to aspire for and do other things both as career and interest will come along if u have at least a high school diploma or GED...I hope u give completing your education a serious thought...I am not trying diminish or shame your current work...I just believe you are meant for much better things in life... Bcoz I believe if u really decide to focus on completing education and go on further if possible through community colleges..you will honestly excel.
kthjus,,giqkzzj,When the schools closed and everything went to virtual, I did try.  Lasted a couple of months.  I did good with history and English.  Math and science...was basically told I'm a retard.  Teacher said I needed to go back and do 6th grade math.  Embarrassing when your little sister could figure some of the stuff out.
kthjus,,giqnfn9,That's no reason to give up...and no body is a retard just bcoz u can't do maths and science...I was total shit in maths and science and good in history and literature subjects...my parents told me I m not meant for application based subjects like maths,physics and chemistry...And in 11th grade decided to improve my basics of maths...I literally went back to 7th and 8th grade maths...worked out every thing from basic level...my friends laughed at me doing 8th grade maths once again...but I was determined that I will get my basics right so I could understand the advanced maths of 11th and 12th grade.... Ultimately I passed with average score when everybody expected me to fail in maths including my parents...   Don't let anyone tell u that u can't do something in life especially related to education...If you are weak in maths and science..then go back and start doing 6th grade Maths and Science...learn the basics...if u good in basics you ultimately able to solve advanced maths like calculus.... Don't give up on education bcoz bloody pigshit arrogant moron denigrated and discouraged you.  I know it's hard and unpredictable for u...but whenever we get some WiFi anywhere...try online basic maths and science tutorials...many are available in YouTube...If it is not possible for u to attend high school...then start improving your maths and science from basic level through online resources....And ultimately get your GED even if take couple of years...Make it a goal of yours and work towards it.  Education is basic and the most important thing for independence and success in life... Don't give up on yourself so easily bcoz some arrogant moron said something...You can really do it if put your mind on it and challenge yourself to do it....and I believe u can...As I said before if u can survive the streets then maths or anything is nothing in comparison...U just have to believe in yourself and work hard once again from basic level.
ktjuaj,git14kr,,First off, Happy birthday! I know it's not one of the best, but I promise life will be better..I'm the same age and I've been in the same scenario. #1 you're still considered a homeless youth so you'll be eligible for a lot of help.   Your best bet is to check into the shelter if they have availability. Because you're young, they'll be a lot more willing to help you! A lot of shelters will let you stay for up to a year, so you can save money and get back on your feet..  Try not to spend any money, if it's not necessary. Get a $2 cup of coffee and post up in McDonald's or someplace warm. Sit down, get on the phone and make a plan.   In a lot of cities, they're required to provide shelter when it drops below freezing, so even if that one shelter is full, don't hesitate to call or visit other shelters. If you flag down a cop or visit the most churches, they'll also be willing to point you in the right direction. Riding the bus is a cheap and easy way to get warm and stay safe.   If absolutely all else fails, invest $40-$50 in a sleeping bag and tent. Find a remote spot, but not far enough from help or civilization. Line the bottom with a few layers of cardboard. Its dangerous,  but lighting a few candles will keep you surprisingly warm. Just be careful. Ideally,  the spot should be well hidden enough that you could get away with lighting a fire outdoors before bed.  Hopefully,  you won't need to go "camping" and you can get inside somewhere. Even if all the shelters are full, visit or call them daily and ask for help! Persistents is important when it comes to getting help from the places.   I know it's intimidating, I know its scary and you might feel awful and worthless. But please remember this is a temporary situation and you will be okay! Make a plan every morning and pick at least one thing you can do to improve your life..then try to do it! What doesn't kill you makes you stronger and you'll come out of this situation new and improved!
ksj5ij,gigjtuo,,This is objectively false.  A woman was shot and killed by law enforcement and here is a video of them using teargas:   [Police fire tear gas at Trump supporters protesting outside US Capitol | AFP - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WycSqA7tPcE)
ksj5ij,,gjt40dj,You should reread that quote by brown. What you're saying has nothing to do with what he said smh.
ksj5ij,gihsh89,,A white veteran was shot at the Capitol. And there have been countless protests on both sides that were peaceful, and violent. Stop the divisive rhetoric, and put that race card away for a while, the card is so worn you can't even make out what it says on there anyway. As long as everyone blames the other guy for all these problems - NOTHING will get fixed. I don't know why people can't see that. It isn't partisan, or racial, or sexual, or religious, or any other group identity - these are HUMAN problems, and until we started acting like we are all on the same team, and start taking responsibility for ourselves, and start lifting other people up instead of putting them down, NOTHING WILL CHANGE. So if you want things to stay the same - keep playing these games. The people who have obscene amounts of wealth and the most influence on what happens love what is happening now, and want everyone to keep pointing the finger at each other so nothing changes. All the top wealthiest people in the world have increased their wealth by at least 30% in 2020...you think they want change?

krvmtt,gicrrcb,,So he just straight up lied?

krvmtt,gic8p9l,,Yeah, it was fun when I was 18 and wanted to be different.But then I grew up and it became real.  Tho I hope this guy truly means something, and listens to people's stories. I did this too even homeless. I'd listen to people's stories, ask why some choose to still sleep on the streets when they get $720 a month.  People in power position need to understand one method won't cure it all. Not everyone needs the same exact thing.
krvmtt,,gieyvvx,Sorry, but how can they get 720$ a month? Part-time job? Welfare via being in a shelter? (if its the latter, it could be a fear of getting stabbed)
krvmtt,,gifs2yw,Its social security income, or social security disability income. I know many homeless who get it, tho don't know how. This one guy told me his story, he was forced into electric shock therapy in the 70s, messed him up.

Easy to do with fast food, and why hydration may seem to help or b) too little fiber in diet which is the case for many Americans or c) you have a blood sugar problem that needs medical diagnosis.  The nasty truth is that the obesity crisis in America is  not driven by personal gluttony, it is largely systemic based upon the composition of the food we are marketed.
kov1l0,,ghtx70i,>The nasty truth is that the obesity crisis in America is not driven by personal gluttony, it is largely systemic based upon the composition of the food we are marketed.  Also by what is reasonably priced.  It is fairly easy to get enough cheap calories to survive off of solely using SNAP benefits.  (Based off prepared/semi prepared stuff that won't require much refrigeration and little preparation). Once you start lowering sodium or adding in many fruits and vegetables, or (gasp!) anything organic, the price/calorie starts heading up and out of reach of some.
kov1l0,,ghtz4a8,It's possible. In my experience the biggest problem is bordem. It's tough going into Walmart and realizing 90% of the items are either posion in some form or unaffordable.   Still, I'd argue that almost anything in walmart is better than fast food.
kov1l0,,ghviyc4,A cheap, healthy fill-up option with SNAP in the produce section is bananas and baby carrots. Seasoned canned beans, like refried, or chili beans (just beans in chili sauce, not bean chili), or seasoned black beans, are all cheap and filling.

You have cameras, and no one's breaking in whatever this place is while someone is sleeping by the door.

This town is down over one thousand officers currently and you want to have one arrest a sleeper when peoples shits getting burglarized? Fuck you.

koif7n,ghrolqx,,wouldn't most people just straight up call the popo? its their place, and for better or worse they don't want you there. seems to be a form of consideration to me.  personally id appreciate a heads up. as much as I'd prefer somebody to come up and speak to me. you see reactions even in this thread of hate and suggestions of vandalism and such tho, so maybe thats why they didn't take that route (or maybe theyre sleeping themselves when you're there) either way obviously not everyone is always reasonable to talk to, nothing wrong with a note..  also whos to say you being there wont attract another tent city type situation which you yourself dont even want to be involved with.
koif7n,,ghtud4f,Yes, let's burden the ~~Stazi~~ Police with this because they are our heros and protectors...   they're clearly the right people for the job...   our boys in blue know what to do, so just call 911 to report any of the evildoers you see folks...   you have no responsibility to your fellow man, we'll take it from here...  You're safe now...  You're safe now...  You're safe now...   sshhhhh, sleeep, sshhhhh, go to sleeeeeeep  ....   Whom among you will set the world on fire...!  ...with your love and compassion   ...with a simple sacrifice  .  The mendacity of self to espouse *"move on or I call the law"* is disgusting   I have taught my son and daughter to NEVER call the police, if you want to save a life, call the fire department, if you want to doom someone call the fucking Stazi...
koif7n,,ghroykd,I'm not sleeping there, I was just next door heating water from an outside plug. The building is unmarked and I rarely ever see any cars there. I think they just saw them on the security camera and left that. I don't even know how long it's been there.
koif7n,,ghsmudx,As someone close to being on the street again how are you heating water from an outside plug? Im trying to learn as much as I can. I spent some time last year homeless. I didn't know anything and it was hell.
koif7n,,ghsnj1f,I was given an electric kettle from the 80s. And where I am there are lots of power outlets by the side of building's. But that's when it's the weekend or holidays. Otherwise I go to the park for power.
koif7n,,ghsnq10,There are small mug warmers and hot plates that can operate off of a plug-in USB adapter.  Some businesses and public parks have outlets outside for plugging in electric leaf blowers and lawnmowers.  Though a lot of those outlets are covered and locked, some aren't.  https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjD2-b7sPztAhXKGK0GHfE1CBEYABAGGgJwdg&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESQOD2L7FSS0f1hyRVXv1ibOb4vsTOtmwbc69XKmlb0NaZprh7gAZD2E4KmsN5wyQNEutJ4GbOb8-nzFmZGy-4-po&sig=AOD64_1FbTrOnbDA7T0zmbdNxCJSTh6X8g&ctype=5&q=&ved=2ahUKEwjuseH7sPztAhUDip4KHQhiAHQQ9aACegQIEhBG&adurl=
koif7n,,ghrpc1s,Because it just won't, my tunnel near there is for drainage mostly. Its too wet for too many people. Too many are afraid of snakes and other animals. Its too hard to climb down with stuff, but there was a guy who did set up a real bed, a couch, coffee table, a gate. It was nice, till the next flash flood made him leave and litter the creek with all that junk.
koif7n,,ghsmdq1,So what keepa you from ending up in the creek from a flash flood?
koif7n,,ghv9yn4,I have a phone to check weather, I do so often. If there's a flash flood I sleep elsewhere. Plus since I've been down there for so long, one thunder clap will wake me up. Plus there are drains from the parking lot over me that will wake me up.   But it's best to stay on top of the weather.
koif7n,ghrl3hi,,I wouldnt sleep there ever again. I would, however, shit in that exact spot every night for a month.
koif7n,,ghrlens,Lol. But theyre on camera. I can't do it. I hope whoever sleeps there just goes across the street. There are better places to sleep. I feel for whoever it is.
koif7n,,ghrljzp,Its 2021. We all wearing masks. Shit there and wave at the camera. Maybe even stake out the place the next day and give yourself a good chuckle watching them discover and have to clean your mess.
koif7n,,ghrmmf9,My mask is identifiable its the Maryland flag and im in austin texas, ill sit this one out forgive the sad pun.
koif7n,,ghu4gxw,let's go Ravens haha wish the best for you bud. I'm glad you're in TX. we got a bunch more snow up here in NH last night and it's wet now and miserable.
koif7n,,ghrnr12,Bro he is just being funny. We get it you dont want to do anything
koif7n,,ghrqshm,i would totaly take a dump on that thing and laugh with the cops when they pick me up
koif7n,,ghs61xy, I was gonna say. That's how you get poop in your doorway.  A peaceful clean sleeper actually displaces less desirable activity. Let's face it, often that group has no fucks to give about Karen's camera.  Enjoy your daily garbage, feces and needle cleanup Karen!
koif7n,ghs9upw,,Mask up and talk to the store owner and see if you can come to an agreement. I worked out sleeping spots on the past by offering to sweep up around the property before I left in the morning.  It's always worth a shot. Or just move on r/vagabond to the next spot.
koif7n,,ghvaasb,That building is unmarked, possibly offices. I'm sure the owner posted that. I have my spot, im sure they will just move on.
koif7n,,ghvf1to,This was my least favorite thing about being on the street. Trying to find a spot to just sleep in peace.  Happy Trails, Asa
koif7n,ghr9b81,,People are soulless monsters. Trust no one.
koif7n,ghrsrmq,,And your username...  That says it all.  I'm no longer homeless, but I stay here because I like you all, been there and anyone that has been homeless knows how shitty it is, we don't really want to be there, it's now what we want for ourselves, and some of you have it way worse than I ever did, at least I had a car to sleep in.  Fuck them and may they never learn what it's like.  OP, hope you find a better place to cozy up, people are shitty.  *Hugs*
koif7n,,ghs3a2q,Yeah, at least I had a pickup to live in, the few years in AVL. Snooty people are the worst, sadly.
koif7n,ghryi41,,Heartless
koif7n,,ghrzjks,Yes, sad that some people must think like that until it happens to them or some one close.
koif7n,ghsn7y3,,They printed out a note. It started "we see you don't have a place to sleep." This could've been the start of a r/humansbeingbros post.  I don't know why I expected something nice to follow.  Its like you can't count on anything but being asked to move along.
koif7n,,ghsoh7c,To be sort of fair, this street is mostly quiet and there are houses converted to commercial stuff. This particular building is unmarked and it hit me that they would leave that sign when there is zero indication that someone was there.  However, this whole block is full of businesses owned by silver age married couples still holding on to president Reagan and hate anything new. I still love it here though. Not for them, but how quiet and mostly safe it is here.
koif7n,,ghsq2o0,When I see a sign next to someone's paddle cacti in spanish, "Don't steal the nopales, please."  I know that person is a dark-souled, cynical asshole.  When I have to question whether this sign is preventative or prescriptive and it could easily be either, it makes me feel like a cynical asshole along with them.  Like when you're pretty sure someone just put up their Black Lives Matter sign with the hopes it might protect their shop windows.
koif7n,ghsts8g,,I think people of means should read/re-read The Grapes of Wrath.
koif7n,,ghsugzl,Most definitely. I'll bet most of those who do this don't know of that movie.  Im gonna rewatch that now. (After I binge this new cobra kai)
koif7n,ghr9m7q,,This is the shittiest attitude ever.
koif7n,ghrhn9b,,Is this bs note on a sidewalk
koif7n,,ghri1rs,I forgot to say its an unmarked building in my area, grew up here.   In fact, its 2 doors down from the air raid scene in dazed and confused. That part is highly Google able. It is a very quiet area and I sleep near there in a tunnel.  I was next door warming up soup when I walked around stretching my legs.
koif7n,,ghrx2ne,>air raid scene in dazed and confused  This is "why can't we be friends?"  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plby-6AuKmg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plby-6AuKmg)

koif7n,ghscxkt,,People are so ignorant, seeing this saddens me üòîüò°
koif7n,,ghsdn6e,Me too.
koif7n,,ghtg30x,It's not ignorance nearly so much as a dichotomy in perspectives on the value of monetary currency. I see hate and separatism as a direct result of lifestyle standards that primarily focus all of life from a basis of financial provisions and submission to the means necessary to build and maintain financial "wealth"/"freedom," whereas the non-religious spiritualist, dreaming philosopher/artist who instead upholds the invaluable freedoms of existence's uniqueness and sacred freedom is so far removed from a boxed up embodiment of the inevitable cynicism produced by dependency upon finances.
koif7n,ght9x4j,,Yeah I got a similar note last month but worse saying of I didn't move then they'll take all my stuff.
koif7n,,ghuv1jp,That's even worse. I hate those types of people the same as any other thieves.

Stalin killed 60M   Mao killed 40M  Pol Pot in Cambodia, Mengistu in Ethiopia, The Kim Family of North Korea, Ceausescu, Tito  Do you want to live in East Germany under Walter Ulbricht, and Willi Stoph, who used the very same Nazi Concentration Camps to now house citizens of the DDR...?  Would you like to be sent to Koylima to mine uranium because you forgot your papers...?  ...point the blame where it belongs...  The World Wide Corporate Hegemony, that we foolishly call democracy, has developed a useless class of people...  NOT an Ideology...  and Ideology only has power if we give it power, so don't blame *"capitalism or consumerism"* or any other -isms...   our enemy, the enemy of all mankind has a face, and a name... and they too will use ideologies that suit their needs when it is convenient for them...  If you want to find out what or whom these people are just start telling the truth, and they will come after you...  Leave the ideologies out of it; he who has the best story wins the day anyway... Ideologies are what got us into this mess in the first place...  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps are used to murder and *re-educate* millions of Uyghur  people, right now as we speak, in China...

kol5j2,ghs4w72,,If there really isn't any employment options which are closer then 30-45 minutes by bike is feasible. I walk 45 minutes to work and 45 minutes back every day after working 10 hours. Im tired, but sometimes I actually enjoy it because I listen to ted talks etc. It's just for the time being so you can get some more savings together and get a car. It's a means to an end. It's also free exercise.
kol5j2,ghug94p,,A $500 car is going to cause you a lot of headaches and cost a lot more money probably very soon down the road. I'd try to save up at least $1000, tbh
kol5j2,ghrvsn3,,Wow, you are in a tough spot.  Is it possible to find a job closer to where you live?  You will have to insure the car and put gas in it, and get it registered in your name, so your $500 isn't going to be enough.  It's really tough to start out in life without your parent's support.  I hope things work out for you.
kol5j2,,ghrwbwn,No ive already checked, this is one of the closest places and its still 7 miles away, I thought about getting a  bike but even then it's still 30-45 minutes. There aren't any mopeds or anything within my price range in my area
kol5j2,,ghrwxs5,What is the weather like in your area?
kol5j2,,ghrx1lc,Its texas so its bipolar as hell. One day its 90 degrees in the blazing sun and the next its no where to be seen and its dropped to 50 and started raining
kol5j2,,ghryjxa,Do you think you could do a 1/2 hour bike ride commute until you could save more money?  One thing you have in your favor is your youth which means more energy than older people.  I've read through some of your posts and you sound quite smart.  I really hope you will apply for scholarships for college so you can work your way out of this situation.  Keep posting here.  Also, can you find a mentor somewhere to help with advice?  You really sound like a good person.
kol5j2,,ghrz1mw,Thank you, it means alot especially coming from a broken or more so shattered home. At the end of the day its possible but this is just how I feel since I just got the job a month or two in and I might not feel the same. But by then I should have figured something out. Every college I've been accepted into, ive applied for on school campus i just have to get through the rest of my highschool career and the summer that ensues and I should be alright. One of the social workers at my highschool recommended one of the services there but I havnt been able to go. I'll check it out Tuesday thank you.
kol5j2,,gi259p2,A bike would be great for you man. Physical exercise will keep you in shape and also generate enough endorphins to put you in a good mood, aleviate depression etc. Take it from someone who did bike delivery for 3 years. Took me 7 miles every day just to get to the city center and start taking orders.  Plus it's much cheaper for maintenance, you can still have money saved in case of an emergency. The alternative being if your car breaks down and no savings then what?
kol5j2,ghsbhwb,,so you can go online and get these motors to attach to a normal bike pain in the ass to put together but you can go forever on a gallon of gas and it gets pretty fast all in all it shouldnt cost more than 300 depending on the bike you get
kol5j2,ghrrffy,,If you're staying with a friend, I would see about getting a job where he works (or nearby) so you could carpool. Otherwise there's really not much you could do. I don't know if this is soft begging, but I can promise you this isn't the sub to get a donation, head over to r/assistance or gofundme for better luck.
kol5j2,,ghrrpf8,He doesn't work and no this isn't begging im just asking for advice and suggestions. Thank you though
kol5j2,ghvfxc4,,What about some Electric Scooter? They are around 300$ new (150$ used), fast enough and dont need any big service, insurance and gas. I own Xiaomi Scooter and 7miles is like 45% of battery, so its should be perfect for you.
kol5j2,ghvgalt,,I thought about it but the way to my job isn't exactly what you would call a "paved road" its a road but barely even for bikes and there is alot of construction going on with a very small one lane with no shoulder road, the detour would add about a mile and a half to the trip so I thought against it
kol5j2,ghvqaxc,,Hi Zephyrus,  I saw a thread on here about job corps and thought it might be of interest to you.  They will help with education.   [https://www.jobcorps.gov/center/edison-job-corps-center](https://www.jobcorps.gov/center/edison-job-corps-center)   We are all rooting for you.
kny5qa,ghn9lza,,I would very much rethink this choice. Do you have experience in the woods? Can you hunt and trap? Are you familiar with poisonous plants? Do have a way to sterilize water (this is a biggie, the diarrhea caused by giardia will kill you)? Shelter? Fire? Not to mention that the search for a 13 year old will probably include dogs and helicopter searches. Buddy, think this through. Whatever is happening at home can be addressed by the police or a therapist. Once you enter those woods, things are going to get serious. Ok, that's my pitch, please don't do it. Good luck either way.
kny5qa,,ghnam4u,Yep been in the woods all my life, can hunt with guns (idk if I‚Äôll bring them though), trapping will be something I need to learn, familiar with poisonous plants, yep I can bring pots and the topography makes tons of creeks with flowing nice water, yep I‚Äôll bring my nice tent, yep I‚Äôd bring multiple ferro rods and matches  I‚Äôve seen on video the helicopters have thermal visions, I‚Äôd need to be underground or bury myself in the many caves I know.  The dogs I‚Äôll plan on a way to throw off, I‚Äôd need to make sure skin cells didn‚Äôt drop.  Meh I don‚Äôt like talking to people, I deal with things alone or anonymously.
kny5qa,,ghnc3sp,Skin cells? Welp. Ok, you've told reddit that you are a half Punjabi 13 year old driving a 1995 Ford pickup into Monroe Morgan forest with expired plates. I'm assuming you're out of Bloomington or perhaps Martinsville. You may be carrying a 20 gauge and or a 22mag (you can hunt under the age of 18 in IN with adult supervision or on your families property) which you plan on taking game with, and I'm assuming without a licence or permit. I'm not a cop or a DNR agent and I've got a pretty good bead on you already. How long do you think you'll last now? It's winter kid, no berries, no morels and other edibles are gone, there's squirrel and rabbit, you know about tularemia, do you know its a bacteria, that the spots aren't always white, and that once you've opened the rabbit, it's on you knife and hands? Go home. Study up, become a park ranger, and live happy in the woods instead of hiding in those limestone caves.
kny5qa,,ghnctux,I‚Äôm not planning on leaving yet, it‚Äôs not that I wanna live in the woods either, just spend maybe a week-month.  And I‚Äôd be taking hand sanitizer, I‚Äôd skin all my game near a creek and thoroughly wash my hands.   I‚Äôm not leaving in the middle of winter, spending months of planning first.  I mean Morgan Monroe is kinda huge, it would take weeks to cover it on foot.  Also nope not in either, Bloomington or martinsville
kny5qa,,ghnfo87,Oh! You're planning like an extended camping trip! So you want to just head out to the woods to get away from things, but you're coming back in a week or so? That's much, much more reasonable than what I though was happening. I though you were going to just disappear into the woods forever. Yeah, morgan monroe is big, and you can hide, but your truck can't, so keep that in mind. Also, since this is now way less dangerous than I thought, don't bring guns, bring a cooler of food in your truck. That way you won't really be breaking any major laws besides operating a vehicle without a license, which I think is a class c misdemeanor. It's not that hunting is a major crime, but a 13 year old with a couple guns by himself, in the middle of no where, its going to draw attention, and not the good kind. You should still bring a signaling device and a loud whistle. You roll your ankle or break a leg and you might find yourself in a tight spot. And ferro rods suck, especially when things are damp, bring multiple ways of starting a fire, never use wet rocks when building a fire, you shouldn't even be in this sub, head over to r/survival. God speed and whatever it is that you're getting away from, remember that it will be there when you come back. Problems need to be addressed, they don't just disappear.
kny5qa,,ghnqqso,Yeah it would be unrealistic to disappear forever, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that   A way I‚Äôm thinking about concealing my truck is leaving it behind me near the trail I can take straight to camp. But that would be around a 10-14 mile trip, I‚Äôve walked this trail that‚Äôs 7 mi about 3 times while backpacking  Bringing guns would just be a bit meh. So many cons that outweigh the pros   Definitely gonna need multiple ways if fire starting  I know problems don‚Äôt disappear but i am 100% sure this will help me get my head straight
kny5qa,,ghstf51,So why are you on a homeless subreddit then?-
kny5qa,,ghsuaz7,Because I‚Äôll be homeless for a week to a month?
kny5qa,,ghsuet8,But you are actively choosing to runaway am I right? You have your parents and a roof over your head?

kny5qa,ghpsvsh,,You mean your post on r/runaway that was removed? Or the one there now warning that you‚Äôre definitely not 13 and likely preying on young kids?
kny5qa,,ghpx7jo,No, they removed it because my plan was bad  Oh that frosty dude thought I was a predator I‚Äôm gonna copy paste his comment and my reply  Here‚Äôs what the mod said: Hello,  I‚Äôve removed this post as it has a lot of red flags. Gathering a bunch of runaway youth to take across state borders, and leave them in the forest with guns and ammunition? This reeks of enticement, and at best, is highly idealistic and misguided. I wish you the best and I hope you‚Äôve gotten some effective advice here, but bringing firearms like this and everything else is a pretty bad idea. Please refer to our sidebar and stickied post for resources that you may find helpful.  And here‚Äôs what the guy who thinks I‚Äôm a pedo says:   I think your a little more than what your playing it off as,"a 13 year old boy." Maybe i'm wrong, and you are 13, and have someone coaxing you and telling you what to type, do. Your post gives me a really weird vibe, scary even. Your writing isn't like most 13 years old. Too descriptive,  you have things to well planned out for a 13 year old. I personally think, you, or maybe someone your with using you, is a creeper looking to find youngin's who had their hearts broken by their families, ran away, and sadly into worst hands. I have younger siblings, and i'd be damned if i let her run off with some person claiming to help lead kids, or others into woods, or anything of the sort.  So, are you a predator? Using the nice guy act, to warn em of predators, building a trust, when in reality its you they should be looking out for?   Oh never mind guess mod removed for me seeming like a pedo, guess it‚Äôs woods time alone.
kny5qa,,ghstlzr,Honestly, you do not sound 13.
kny5qa,,ghsu9mq,Yeah I know people say that a lot. I‚Äôm not trying to act older or younger.  I guess most 13 yr olds only talk in finnas, cops, steals, ayos and bruhs. And abbreviate everything. I enjoy writing my thoughts down collectively instead of in a messy and sloppy way.
kny5qa,,ghsvjx8,I honestly think at this point you should give some evidence that you are 13. At the end of the day, you were removed from another subreddit due to suspicious behaviour. And no, a lot of kids do have very good grammar BUT you were asking kids to come runaway with you. Here is my question, if you are able to write such detailed posts why don't you understand that asking kids to runaway with you was a bad idea? Bringing fire arms etc? If I was in your shoes, I would know that it could pose immediate danger to those kids, so I wouldn't do it.
kny5qa,,ghsvzk5,I have no evidence to give that I‚Äôm 13 that I‚Äôm sharing on the internet, I do understand it‚Äôs a bad idea I guess, I mean if a kid goes and stays with a pimp or meth dealer it‚Äôll be a lot worse than the forests. I mentioned guns partially because I wanted to see what people would say about it, and yeah running away does pose an immediate threat. Just about all kinds of it.
kny5qa,gi0j8a5,,Dispersed camping is legal in national forests as long as you move your camp a certain distance every ten days, I believe. You might want to reconsider your plans though, because living in the national forest by yourself with no transportation or resources is a lot harder than you think it is. Try finding a local youth shelter
kny5qa,ghnhifc,,This sounds like fantasy to me, but ill humor you as best as i can.  1. Plan where you are going to be. Will that location supply food, water, shelter, concealment?  My ideal location would have a pond or lake for clean water and fish for food.  The area would need to have some open and some dense woods, open being beneficial for small game hunting and dense for sleeping and hiding.  2. you can not rely on the location for your needs.  Bring enough food to last the duration, and a way to get clean water.  I suggest you start by learning how to cook the simple foods you would want.  Foods i would suggest are: Rice, Peanut butter, Olive oil, Pasta, instant mashed potatoes, Tortillas, Lots of butter, oatmeal, and chocolate (sugar).  Water can be boiled or filtered, i suggest both.  a quick pour through a bandana or cloth will get most of the dirt out, then filter that with a cheap drip or squeeze filter.  3. You will run into people.  There are energetic fucks who will go explore nature at all times and weather conditions.  Park rangers will roam around and do location checks.  In reality you will NEED to be in a more heavily trafficked location do to your water and resupply needs, most ponds or small bodies of water are have roads leading to them.  As far as being stealthy, try NOT to look sneaky.  If you look like you belong then people who observe you will not think you out place and call the police.  Plan your trips into the populated areas, go in, get your daily water, and get out.    4. Camp location: if you are worried about being tracked by dogs, change your camping location every night.  As a bonus carrying your gear and looking like a backpacker help people ignore you.  If you are worried about a manhunt or thermal imaging you can cover your shelter with snow, or a thick mass of ground matter (leaves, moss, grass).  A thermal reflective barrier is also an option, these can be found as Mylar blankets, or The silvery tarps.  While this can stop some IR cameras from detecting you there will be heat leakage around the sides.  Every thing you add will help a little.    I suggest deep woods for sleeping, evergreens are best.  the thin tips from Conifer branches can be used for insulation, shelter, and concealment.   5. Fire and Warmth:  Fire is needed but will give away your location.  Small and Hot is the key.  Hobo stoves are great, but they dont do much to keep you warm.   For warmth your best option is clothing.  Plan on as few fires as possible, preferably just for cooking and boiling water.  Having an extra 2 or 3 layers of clothing will help in many ways.   6 and final:   GET REAL!!!  if this isn't planned you will fail, it will be pathetic, and you could die.  End of story.  Realistically what you need is a full set of camping gear and warm winter clothes.  You wont be traveling light.  Hunting is not a good option, but fishing can be.  Do Not try to forage in the woods... Plants Can Kill.  If you are going to be armed, plan on harsher punishment when you are caught.  Shelter is the most important, have multiple options. Perhaps carry a Tent, a Tarp, and four 55 gallon trash bags.  Do not let your gear get wet.  use the trash bags to line your backpack, to cover your sleeping bag, to keep your wet rained on clothes in when you change.  Learn Bushcraft.  you do not need a 10" knife...  with a small fixed blade you can carve wedges and use those to split logs.  use a folding saw to cut all your firewood, use some of that firewood as a baton to hit the wedges.  an axe is useless weight, as is a machete in most locations.  You will be found.  When your parents report you missing the police will start looking, your picture will be posted in many locations including the start of hiking trails.  when you go into a store to get food, people will see you, cameras will film you.  if you bring your phone, you will be constantly tracked.     If you think running away is a solution then you are wrong.  Seek real help, not the advice of us idiots on reddit.
kny5qa,,ghnjzof,Thanks for the tips, especially the pine tree things, I feel they catch more rain and are a lot better for insulation   I live several counties away from martinsville. Idk if they‚Äôd post pictures but I‚Äôm ready for it  And being alone in the woods is about the only thing that helps me, I‚Äôm not suicidal but I‚Äôd rather live happy in the woods for a month and die than I‚Äôve the next 77 years like shit  Spending a week to a month in the woods will probably get my life straightened out mentally
kny5qa,ghnapep,,You know, tbh, you're making the situation much harder than it needs to be. Your best bet, is to camp a mile off into to the woods, and travel back to town and fly a sign at walmart to get money and buy food. Or better yet, buy food b4 hand. It's too easy to watch videos on YouTube about survival and sya, I can do that. Then you get out there, miles form help and realize you're in way over your head. Surviving entirely off the land is 100% possible, but we're talking years of training and knowledge. Without that, the honest trust is you're probably going to die. If you leave your home state, odds are very low anyone will be looking for you there. And you can then go fly a sign or panhandle to get money for food, and return to camp. If you're dead set on surviving entirely off the land, make sure to pick a spot you can catch fish. That will be your main food source. If you set traps like the guides I posted on the other post, don't set one. Set 6 or more, all around your camp and surrounding wood. Do you know how to spot animal trails? And can you tell the difference between deer, or rabbit trails? Can you tell how often it's traveled? You'll need to know these things to effectively set the traps. Most of the traps I sent are easy to set, true, but if not set in the right location they will never catch anything. If you see a lot of squirrels, you may have an easier target. Take a rat trap, drill a hole through the corner, (not the end that kills) and run bailing wire through it. Tie that to a tree limb, and bait with peanut butter, balancing it on the limb. Sprinkle sunflower seeds along the limb as extra incentive. If a squirrel tries to eat from it, well, same effect as a mouse. If a squirrel tries to pass over it, you can still catch him a lot of the time, even without bait on it.  I have been surviving off in the woods for years, and while I can survive completely off the grid, I choose to stay near enough to a town to be able to get money and buy food I need. It's just easier. Just make sure you understand what you're getting into if you go out into the middle of nowhere. Survival isn't as easy as youtube makes it seem.  Edit: in case I wasn't clear, if you don't want to be found, leave the state. If you stay in your home state, it increases your odds of being found. A dog can't smell you from 300 miles away, no matter how good his nose is. Likewise a helicopter can't spot you if they're not looking in the right location.
kny5qa,,ghnbymq,Yeah that might be what I need to do, in this area mini towns of just gas stations and what not are all around, yeah deer vs rabbit trails are pretty easy,rabbit trails I feel usually duck under brush and stuff and will have some bunny pellets around, and deer trail have nothing around it and bigger twigs and stuff will be broken.  Yeah survivals really hard, last year I was only able to make it off the land for 3 days. Killed 2 squirrels and drank lots of water but still was extremely exhausted and whooped.  I have a bow and arrow that I can shoot effectively at around 25 yards. I might be able to kill a deer for winter. I have no clue how to preserve that much meat though.
kny5qa,,ghne3jt,If there's lots of rabbits, your earlier concern in the other post about coyotes is null. Rabbits is thier main source. If there's lots of them, they aren't starving, and will 100% of the time run from you. In order to preserve meat, you have to salt and cure it. Mmm, jerky. I love jerky. Never had deer jerky, but I'd bet it's delicious. You should be able to find videos on YouTube no problem on how to do this. Speaking of videos, if you have a means to keep your device charged, there are plenty of websites that will let you download videos off of YouTube. Just copy the videos link, and paste it on one of these sites. Then you can have video tutorials to take with you. And yes you're right survival is absolutely hard. Have you ever noticed when cops are searching for someone lost in the woods after like 2 3 weeks they call off the search? It's not because they think he's such a good hider. It's because after that time they figure he's dead.
ko01yx,ghnihjj,,Cheapest is a shelter or sleeping in your car. If you go for the car option, be sure to park in a big box store parking lot and have a decent sleeping bag and something to cover your windows with. 100 dollars does not go far and it's good to have a little cash on hand for emergencies until you have a paycheck. Good luck, stay warm. Have you ever had a job? Did you file taxes in 2018?  Asking because you might be $600 richer in a few days.
ko01yx,ghpvr3d,,Better pray you get this job or it be hell
ko01yx,ghr4g08,,I'm sorry this has happened to you. It's good that you have your car and interviews coming up! My advice would be to still apply for jobs despite the interviews just incase. Have a plan A and a plan B depending on if you do or don't land a job. Look into homeless services in your area, unemployment benefits, food stamps etc and see what you can get. Eat as cheaply as possible for the time being and make that 100 stretch as far as you can. Research job interview questions and the companies you are interviewing for and nail that interview! I'm routing for you!
ko01yx,ghnjshl,,Save as much as you can for gas, you never know when your friend might want you to leave.. You could donate plasma until you find a job, if that's an option. I'm assuming you won't be getting a stimulus check if your dad claimed you on his taxes.. Or you're not in the U.S   Just take advantage of your situation at your friends house for the time being. Save absolutely as much cash as you can, you don't want to be on your last dollar wondering if you have enough gas to go get a McDonald's sandwich! There's tons of information on this sub, just do some digging.  Good luck! Hope all works out for you with your interviews :)
ko01yx,,ghnjz8u,As for the best option for having a place to live, I'm assuming you don't want to live in a tent or your car.. Which would save a lot of money, BUT I would find some roommates dude. Don't waste what little you have on air bnb or shit motels if you can help it. Just plan it out while you can
ko01yx,,ghqnea9,If he is 23, I wouldn't assume his dad claimed him on his taxes.  Deep\_Fee did you file taxes last year?  Do you have an ID (don't lose it!  Buy a money belt and guard it well)?  Do you have a bank account?  Here is info on a child dependent:  ### Qualifying child  In addition to the qualifications above, to claim an exemption for your child, you must be able to answer "yes" to all of the following questions.  * **Are they related to you?** The child can be your son, daughter, stepchild, eligible foster child, brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, adopted child or an offspring of any of them. * **Do they meet the age requirement?** Your child must be under age 19 or, if a full-time student, under age 24. There is no age limit if your child is permanently and totally disabled. * **Do they live with you?** Your child must live with you for more than half the year, but several exceptions apply. * **Do you financially support them?** Your child may have a job, but that job cannot provide more than half of her support. * **Are you the only person claiming them?** This¬†requirement commonly applies to children of divorced parents. Here you must use the ‚Äútie breaker rules,‚Äù which are found in IRS[ Publication 501](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_publink1000220868). These rules establish income, parentage and residency requirements for claiming a child.
knbopu,ghjkkxc,,Yes and turning them inside out not only helps with the fade but definitely helps kill the smell!
knbopu,ghlmpki,,Yep. I do this all the time in the summer. I take my dirty clothes (or just wear them) in the water at the beach and if there are waves and it is choppy or rough, it is like being in a washing machine - then the sun does its thing. Bigger problem in the winter - at least around here b/c there just isn't much sun and even on sunny days, it is so low in the sky it won't do much. Good advice.
knbopu,ghjks12,,Excellent advice. Another reason why nature has better healing properties than human creations

knb9lf,ghjg984,,That sucks bro. Don't you live in Littleton? Going from car camping to a bike, in Colorado, in the winter. Did you run afoul a gypsy or perhaps make a monkey paw wish? Well my dude, I know you're going to be alright, you've still got that office job, right? Any chance you can crash under the desk?
knb9lf,,ghjievo,i checked on that and it‚Äôs grounds for eviction if caught sleeping in the unit unfortunately
knb9lf,,ghjitd9,Well that sucks. But happy to hear you've still got employment. I mean, in the time of Covid, that counts as a victory!
knb9lf,ghnjni3,,Anything we can do to help?
knb9lf,ghwfb6a,,That might be too nice of a bike for your situation it will attract thieves. I would look int o getting something cheaper and less flashy and/or a more heavy duty lock / quick release front hub if its possible for you.
knb9lf,ghkpgx1,,Dude... volvlo parts are cheap, and you have acsess to the entire wealth of human knowledge and technical volvo information at the touch of a button.   Most modern transmissions are electronically controlled and the hard parts, like clutches and bands, rarely fail... even if they do, its still not that bad of a job, especially when you consider it goves you a warm dry place to sleep.   If your going to live in a car, you need to be willing and able to fix your car.
knb9lf,,ghnjmf7,I mean he already sold it for scrap so I doubt he needs a lecture about what he should have done. I would say if you‚Äôre going to live in your car you have to be willing to roll with things and it‚Äôs clear this dude can do that.

kmo0zx,ghfpgr3,,America is going to have to decide whether human life is worth more than property values.  CORPORATE America has already chosen.
kmo0zx,,ghfpp09,Sheryl brought up some really good points in this podcast. Things I absolutely wasn't aware of. I think we need to come to the understanding that the government might not ride to the rescue. The government was perfectly fine with the homelessness crisis created by the 2008 crash. They were perfectly fine with empty buildings which are still empty by the way. But I wanted to put this podcast here to raise awareness of issues that I didn't even know.
kmo0zx,,ghfvccs,Raising awareness of issues you didn't know, such as?  Unless We the People get out and protest and scream blue bloody murder in the streets, the government (operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of major corporate interests and high net worth individuals so it's certainly not OUR government) will happily repeat 2008-2009.
kmo0zx,,ghfvjw4,Well one of the things I wasn't aware of was the fact that it's actually to the apartment's benefit to basically sit empty. Objectively, it's better for an apartment to be empty than full for example. Just listen to the podcast if you're able. I'm not getting paid to do this. It doesn't affect my bank account one way or the other. Just trying to raise awareness
kmo0zx,,ghfw89z,Yes; it doesn't deteriorate and reducing supply helps prop up the price, which leads to an asset bubble and the inability of those without large sums of money to afford housing.
kmo0zx,,ghfvwnd,Please post a transcript or at least a synopsis.
kmo0zx,,ghg2g6y,I don't know if you wanted to listen to podcast or just want transcript / synopsis . The link didn't work for me so I looked up my internet browser and found it on podbean and listened for free .

klswwu,,ghb819o,Yes, that would be horrible.  It's bad enough to have the chills when inside a warm apartment but to be in a car or tent would be brutal.
klswwu,ghbwljg,,Wow its great to hear you are housed. The power if a locked door can do wonders ! Beat Covid and enjoy your new digs.

klswwu,,ghcj7gc,Thank you!  Ill definatly do that!
klswwu,ghdanzo,,Hey there! Make sure you have a fan or device that can play music or videos. The first few nights are the hardest, being housed is so fucking quiet it‚Äôs enough to induce madness and paranoia.   Keep reaching out and know that you‚Äôre going through a legitimate culture change, getting housed is in so many ways like moving to a whole new country. If you feel crazy remember that it‚Äôs this system that is insane, not you.
klswwu,,ghswp3s,My first few nights went by pretty smooth. I am sick so I did end up sleeping through a few days. Sleeping in a real bed is the biggest change and I keep feeling like its going to get taken from me.

klswwu,ghhb78w,,Sleep well brother, if you ever need people to talk to we got a community started over at r/formerlyhomeless it's just started up but am hoping to turn it into a place for people to talk about stuff as it comes and goes.  I've been off the streets for a while now but I still have a hell of a time with ptsd and all sorts of other stuff, being on the streets for so long has really impacted me. I think our governments really aren't doing a great job in considering the conditioning that happens when you're homeless and all its effects, for me at least it's been very very hard.  Anyways if you ever want a chat or are having some weird struggles coming to terms with living in a new place r/formerlyhomeless is there for you.  I think if we can fill up the place with stories and conversations people that come after us can have a place to go and not feel so alone. We are going to have alot of people suffering and needing a place to go as the effects of economic damage from covid related stuff hits.

klstkv,ghe2wwy,,If any of you live by a pilot gas station/ truck stop they give out free shower vouchers when you buy a full tank of diesel. Most truckers don't use their free showers and leave the vouchers at the pump. Check by the pumps/ garbage and you can get yourself a free shower.

klstkv,,ghbxoy5,Salvation Army won't even piss on you if you're on fire.
klstkv,,ghc2yxw,Wow that's a super strong stance on SA! Had no idea people felt this way. I seriously thought they helped people. Is this the same across the country? Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this, please don't hesitate to expand on why you feel this way.   Oh man, if SA doesn't adequately help people, then who does?? I'm super disappointed! If you know of any organizations that do help, please let me know so I can suggest and donate to them. People want to help. Thanks again for your insight on this.
klstkv,,ghc58lt,I'm in southwest Michigan. When we lost everything in a house fire and my mom and I were living in our vehicles (in freezing temperatures), their only suggestion was "call 211." You're better off going to a Catholic church and participating in whatever religious crap they ask before they'll help you.  Goodwill is slightly more helpful than SA, but they also can't do anything to help you find shelter or a place to shower/do laundry and their CEO's a shitbag. No matter your tenure/performance as an employee, you get minimum wage. Period.  Edit: clarified something
km6yy0,gheh2ib,,I would think a social worker could help discuss the emotional aspect of what the laid off worker was going through.  Maybe help them open their eyes to new possibilities or a different reality.
km6yy0,ghe67pb,,Social workers can help with SNAP/food stamps, domestic abuse trauma, WIC, referrals to shelters, food pantries, free medical clinics, free clothing closets, job training. Assistance with disability and social security forms.  Realistically they cannot help everyone but they can help a lot if they care to do so. Most are overwhelmed by the shear volume of clients.  Engineers are problem solvers by their very nature and have huge advantages in intellect and education. Your weakness is in marketing your product. Fix that.
km6yy0,,ghhn8ve,I'm not engineer or homeless, but I would say that 50 year old laid-off white collar males don't have meth/opoid problems like teenager stoners, are not abused wives who need counseling etc.  I met a few in the Philippines.  One was named Mike, a former Hollywood cameraman unemployed when film production moved to Canada.  He got by as a money lender.  I asked him why he lived in the Philippines & he said "what am I going to do in the USA, clean chicken coups at Wal mart?"  I think this is the general mindset of that cohort.
km6yy0,ghe2z0t,,Social worker might have resources but if I were the engineer I would do a LinkedIn profile, hire a headhunter (paid on the back end by  new employer).apply to every job I want no matter what State and something will give if you put in enough apps and it might be a 100. It doesn't matter. Also apply for part time teaching positions and such for your area of expertise. Looking for a new position  ( think college lecturer) is now your job. Google all hob boards and start today. Good Luck.
km6yy0,ghgiz91,,In my experience social workers get assigned to cases where there are children, DV, homeless outreach (HUD-VASH veterans) or cases in shelters as referrals for services. Also for drug related cases from the court. If you do apply for SNAP and you do intake at the DPSS etc they will refer you to workforce centers and programs. Basically you show up, use the computers to look for jobs, etc.
km6yy0,ghl246a,,Where do I even find a social worker? I'm in San Diego ca
km6yy0,ghmyxwb,,That social worker may be aware of programs or resources you have no clue about. You have experience in whatever profession you came from and living in middle class suburbia... this is a whole new world for you. Treat people with respect, no matter how you arrived you are all in the same place.
km6yy0,ghodxm6,,Jesus, not you again. You posted the same rant in concern 'about a neighbor' just months ago.
km6yy0,,ghoeilx,Months ago? I only began posting here less than a month ago.  Sorry, I feel you are mistaken.  I'm not homeless, but I sometimes wonder how a law-abiding, productive, educated person who brushed their teeth & held a job & has a degree feels when suddenly they're in some tank, or out on the street, with people who did nothing but do drugs from the age of 13 & produce poor children in random hook-ups & bounce in & out of jail.  I mean the entire reason for living in a suburb is to keep the riff-raff out, so to speak.  You want to live next to people who are not dangerously assaultive, who won't stab you for looking at them the wrong way, who are not tweaking on the street etc.  One would think it would be tough for some law-abiding productive citizen to suddenly be in such an environment.
klxymo,ghbynt1,,As far as I understand you need to have filed taxes in 2019 and then receive payment through direct deposit or have a check mailed to an address. https://www.dol.gov/coronavirus/unemployment-insurance
klxymo,ghdzc6g,,Are you telling me that instead of spending the last 10 months doing everything I could to avoid catching the virus and getting sick - I would have been better off doing everything I could to catch it?  I'm out here freezing my ass off dumpster-diving living on a dollar or two a day. It has been 10 months of total hell and I haven't got a cent. I was told I needed to prove income and employment when the whole thing started - and now I am hearing the same thing about this new round. I can't provide proof of anything and I rather not get a bunch of money if it is just going to  cause more grief and stress in the future when they tell me I wasn't supposed to get it and I have to pay it all back. Because there won't be any way to do that and then what?
klxymo,,gheppti,No. Shelters have had outbreaks of Covid-19 and none of those people got one skinny dime. OP heard a rumor and thought it was true. It's not. To get unemployment assistance, you first need to have been employed.

kkf3qy,gh25ca8,,What I'd like to know is how is this an innovation? Why are providing basic service to homeless people not happening now?
kkf3qy,,gh25zun,This IS considered a basic service in many communities. People will do anything and everything for homeless people except make sure that no one ever becomes homeless.
kkf3qy,,gh26bvn,I don't think it is. I think finding even a public toilet is a chore depending on where you are. Demanding 100% housing for all people's a great idea. I'm with you on that. I also think a lot of communities quietly hope homeless people will go away from their community looking for better services if they give none.
kkf3qy,,gh2ml8a,Definitely not reinventing le wheel but   Imagine living in a nation where le wheel   Is a rare commodity, affordable only to some.   As a homeless 0re, seasoned person as i like to define meinself ;)   It's damn near impossible to find proper hygienic places   To keep oneself clean.      Laundry services - impossible   Bath services - impossible   Lavatory services - improbable (For paying customers only)     In terms of hyenine its 95% improbable that you are going to find these services so we definitely need an abundance of things such as this.       Who AM i? No ONE special. Just a man of le Front Lines :D
kkf3qy,,gh26q0l,I agree completely.
kkf3qy,,gh36a8e,Uhhhhh... What communities you at?
kkf3qy,,gh2rjv8,Where do you live, Utopia? This winter in my community seeing how people will do anything and everything to make sure that homeless people fuck off and die.
kkf3qy,,gh2mawb,In my community it's because the city wants to pass the buck to the churches, this town has thousands, and to the street level Outreach volunteers. Small churches and volunteer groups are taking care of all the homeless people and are pushing the city to pitch in, in response. The Big Rich churches are staying eerily quiet. The third part in the triangle is private property or business owners who are trying to pass the buck to the city when they find homeless people on their property and it's just a big inefficient cycle. It means people like my pastor volunteer groups of retired old ladies are having to contend with contractors running bulldozers and chainsaws directly in before cops or city officials ever get on scene. It's freaky.   It boils down to there's not enough shelters and the poorest of churches are running them with volunteers who do it for free and we cannot sustain this there are still people camping in the city even though the city is kind of without saying so maintaining a policy of active sweeps and forcing into the shelters which we don't even have enough yet because they're all reduced capacity
kkf3qy,,gh2qn6d,I was calling homeless agencies in Chicago some time ago as I was getting near to facing homelessness myself, and found these agencies exist to get donations not help homeless people.
kkf3qy,gh2uilu,,I didnt know it was legal to hookup to fire hydrants.

kkf3qy,gh27ykd,,Kudos to the guy but this is not a new concept. Equipment rental companies provide job site and event trailers just like with port-a-potties. Homeless services will periodically rent shower trucks.
kkf3qy,,gh2vijm,The thermal overnight shelter here rented (I assume, the additional expenses this year has been mentioned in a fundraising video) a shower trailer for the location they are using most this winter.  Covid is keeping them out of the churches they normally rotate through a week or two at a time.  The trailer seems like it's geared towards events/festivals/etc with 4 male and 4 female shower stalls.

kkxfdx,gh55x77,,My great uncle gave me advice years ago for preventing trenchfoot - slather vasoline all over your feet, put them in fresh socks, walk all over vietnam for a week, repeat.  I've never been in a jungle where I had to wear my boots on for a week at a time, so... I dunno. He's the expert.
kkxfdx,,gh56st9,You'd be surprised how fucked up your feet can get here in the US of A. I don't know about the vaseline but the fresh socks and dry feet are crucial.
kkxfdx,,gh57kf7,Valvoline is motor oil. That's bad.  Vasoline is petroleum jelly. Totally different.   From the internet:  >An old trick used back in the World War 1 era to prevent trench foot was to apply lots of whale oil to the feet in order to repel the moisture and help insulate the feet from the cold. In modern times, it's more practical to rub some Vaseline over your feet instead, although the effect and helpful benefits remain the same.
kkxfdx,,gh585j3,Ah sorry autocorrect. Cool. I'd never heard of the vaseline trick before.
kkxfdx,,gh6cry6,Vasoline really helps to prevent blisters too.  Trader Joe's sells 'Head to Toe balm', it doesn't leave a residue on socks like vasoline does.
kkxfdx,gh7fum4,,Cotton socks suck, it holds the moisture in and draws heat away from the body.  Merino wool will wick water away and will keep your feet warm.
kkxfdx,gh7ht6g,,I used to go thru hand-washed socks super fast by wringing them out before drying, they stretch out & get holes if you don't baby them. Lay them flat on a thick stack of paper towels or napkins & give them (along with the paper towels) a super gentle roll, otherwise don't do anything before air drying. Also, add a 1/2 cup or so of food stamp vinegar to your sink laundry when you're rinsing suds out, it removes soap faster & helps fight off rotted stench diseases. Spraying the inside of your boots with a spritzer style hand sanitizer before & after wearing them helps, keep refilling it with the strongest isopropyl alcohol you can find. Soak your cheddar blocks in a plastic bag with a cup or 2 of listerine a couple times a day if you experience any alarming changes to the usual grossness
kkxfdx,,gh7m3b3,"Cheddar blocks"?  I've never heard feet referred to in that way before.  Where is the slang term from? - or did you invent it?
kkxfdx,,gh7nuai,A friend from California brought it all the way to Maine, I'm not sure where he picked it up-- he rarely used the word 'feet' & it cracked me up every time
kkxfdx,,gh7qo5r,You have got to add it to:   www.urbandictoinary.com
kkxfdx,,gh7rtpc,Haha, will do :)
kkxfdx,ghdn1a3,,My fiance told me awhile back when we were living in a tent for a good 8-9 months (we've since been able to upgrade to an only semi sketch hotel, woo hoo!) that when his feet get wet or hurt or just aren't comfortable that it really effects his entire mood and attitude.  Like he'd be super irritable and short with me and that would be the explanation.  I totally thought BS at first but then realized he was hardly EVER taking his shoes off, sleeping with them on and everything.  I started to get on him about taking them off, changing his socks (I hand washed socks and undies in the BK sink) and I helped make sure his feet kept dry or got dry asap if wet... It was true!!  Y'all he was so much happier all around.  I thought it was kinda funny because I never would have made that connection if he hadn't told me.
kkxfdx,,ghhpz5c,Even when not homeless, if my socks got wet during a hike it would make the hike a lot less fun. Wet socks are just the worst in a psychological way.
kkxfdx,gh97pbe,,A train rider fries of mine said newspaper help prevent trench foot. Provides a bit of insolation for warmth, and soaks up any moisture, at least sweat wise. If you step in a puddle just gotta dry your shoes.

kk8rxf,gh14imz,,Honestly, I feel that some of the pushback against RV dwellers is deserved. I have a theory that the bigger the vehicle the bigger the ego. I have met too many self-entitled and absorbed RVers. RVers are more likely to drive vehicles in a state of disrepair. More likely to make noise and dump trash. More likely to blow shit up.  Too many of them take the realization that they can't be discreet and conclude they should therefore let it all hang out.
kk8rxf,,gh159t9,I think I agree with the vehicle-size/ego-size correlation theory, and not trying to hide when you know you can‚Äôt hide. But just to clarify: I don‚Äôt think this explosion was necessarily caused by an RV dweller, but I‚Äôm concerned about it‚Äôs impact on that community.
kk8rxf,,gh15tfc,The long term impact will be negible from this one incident. There probably will be some short term wariness but in a month everyone will have forgotten all about it.
kk8rxf,,ghhqdxb,I agree and they are the reason why the one walmart that used to tolerate me started running everybody out. They would leave all their trash around and then one blew up in the parking lot. Somehow this means a sedan dweller is also a problem to the room temp IQ employees. And RVers can't figure out why I hate them or move my car so far away from their dumb asses.

kk7uh0,gh0z3s4,,Southern California / Arizona / parts of New Mexico and Colorado are pretty good in the winter  I was camping in CA state parks up until they prohibited overnight stays a couple weeks ago (covid).   I stayed at the Carrizo Plain BLM for a bit but there's not much daylight time, super windy and cold at night.  There's also no water  if pipes freeze so u have to hike/drive like 20 miles to re-up.   It sucks if u don't have a car.  There's tons of BLM land in AZ as well but a lot of the same problems.   Free state park campgrounds are my top choice  Youre definitely gonna want at least a 0 degree sleeping bag for winter.  mines -7 and it starts to feel a bit chilly around 15 degrees.     It's a pretty fun lifestyle but I think you have to be a little bit crazy to enjoy it.   The hardest part is finding ways to make money without residency so having some decent social skills  and be good at networking and harboring friendships / trust I consider essential.    Good luck in  whatever u decide to do bro.   God bless and Merry Christmas!

kk7uh0,,gh1bbj9,You can camp on some of it (up to 14 days out of 28, before moving 25 miles).  "Camping on public lands away from developed recreation facilities is referred to as dispersed camping. Most of the remainder of public lands are open to dispersed camping, as long as it does not conflict with other authorized uses or in areas posted "closed to camping," or in some way adversely affects wildlife species or natural resources."

khd053,ggl2yor,,And if folks seem reluctant, ask for a giftcard to that store, or a big box chain where you can buy most items, from food to home goods. They'll likely have a slew of gift cards at the registers.  Scratchers is a cool idea, but this can also bode poorly depending on who you ask. If someone is of the persuasion that all folks who beg are living well off welfare (these thinkers are EVERYwhere) and think you're "gaming the system," they might call the cops on you for loitering or report you to the store.
khd053,,ggwzc8n,I've never had issues with it! Always worked out well for me. The worst I ever got was a simple "no", but I am in England which I think, from reading online, seems a lot more homeless-friendly than America. I think the mentality here towards street beggars is a lot different than what you described, at least in my city.   Gift cards also am amazing idea though! A lady once bought me one while begging and i found it so useful.
khd053,ggluzzl,,I dunno. I can see a lot of people looking down their nose at you if you asked for a scratch ticket after they offered to buy you food.
khd053,,ggo2l10,I'd feel bad asking for anything lotto/gambling related.  There has to be something else cheap to ask for - shelf stable food, toiletries, even a candy bar.    Not sure if this includes scratchers, but:  "Players lose an average of 47 cents on the dollar each time they buy a ticket."  [The Lottery Is A Regressive Tax On The Poor](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/powerballs-1-5-billion-swindle-of-americans-260a3d58e19e/)
khd053,,ggwyypr,That's why I specified in my post I would ask for them after getting all other essentials. Sometimes you just need money, and people were not willing to give change during covid times, but most were more than happy to get me a scratch card.   The gambling industry preys on people. I don't like it and I don't gamble. However, sometimes as an individual you gotta get some cash together and asking for scratch cards is a good option in these times, when people don't carry as much change as they used to.
khd053,,ggwyodb,Most people don't, surprisingly. I'm speaking from experience here. I would do this after I got food & other essentials. Besides, even if they do, it's worth a try. Who cares what they think?
khd053,gh0caxm,,I've been on the street before and am very close again. I usually fly a sign and never ask.  If I have a couple bucks on me I will almost always give a dollar or two. If someone asked me for a lotto ticket or scratcher that would end it all right there. They would not then nor ever get anything from me again. If you are going to just gamble well I can use that dollar a lot more. You must not need anything else.
khd053,,gjqlxwq,I mean fair enough, but did you read the post properly? It's not about gambling. It's a method to acquire change in situations where folk only have card (such as now, covid n that) and therefore cannot give you change. If someone is willing to give me change, I will not ask for a scratch card or buy one with that money.

I was so messed up and in pain I never got her number. She had the front desk keep my bike for me at the domestic violence women shelter she stayed at . I never actually saw her again until years later I was driving my own car coming out of the store and I saw her car and recognize her she had her kids with her and she was crying because she ran out of gas and didn't have any more money. I had just withdrawn $20 for my own gas but I recognized her and ran out to her and reintroduced ourselves and I gave her the 20 so she could get her kids home with their groceries because her tank was empty in mine still have some in it

kechir,gg1vrs2,,I'm one of these people. I'm in NYC in a hotel room in Brooklyn. As far as I know we are going to be here until everyone has a Covid shot, likely March or April at the earliest. But regardless I am not going back. I have disability now and back pay check coming in June that is large enough to get me out of here if necessary. I would rather have supportive housing because the rent is way cheap and I'd be okay with that, but if it comes down to it I will leave and get my own room somewhere rather than return to a room with a dozen women.   4 of my roommates had Covid that I know of. It was a miracle that I did not get it. I have major health issues and getting it could kill me. This hotel room is a godsend. I'm trying to get housing through the shelter now but my caseworker is well aware that I will not go back to a shelter proper. If they want to place me before June, so be it. But if they don't I'll figure it out and leave anyway.   Putting people into rooms less than 3 feet apart is criminal while Covid rages. Here there would be lawsuits filed the minute they tried it. We have advocates watching out for us and they don't want to go there so until we are all vaccinated I don't think they will try moving us back, but once the  vaccine is generally available I am sure they will. Hopefully by then though I will already be out and in my own place and it won't be such a worry for me...
kechir,,gg20s5t,I'm happy for you. I'm homeless in rural florida and a bit jealous. It is nice to hear that people are using this to get off of the streets. Your example will positively affect the statistics of potential future programs like these. Do it for all of us now.   Plus all the sleep you must be getting. Do that for us too, lol.
kechir,,gg48o1k,I don't sleep that well. It may be a hotel but it's still a shelter. I can't lock my door at night or when I shower. I will sleep like a baby when I finally get my own place and I can do that and cook and have friends over..
kechir,,gg2lcpu,I'm glad you shared your story, I'm also from NYC and I knew our number were going to be ridiculously high early on because we already live on top of each other normally. Like, it's physically harder to socially distance in such a densely populated city. I'm glad you're safe, healthy and have resources. Good luck!
kechir,gg1oa6p,,Can't read the article, but if I had a dollar for every time since March that I heard this fictional story......  Getting a hotel room?  Maybe if you find the chocolate bar with the golden ticket.
kechir,,gg1w1a2,It's not a myth. Something like 11K people are in hotel rooms across NYC. Like I said above I am one of them. But I went through hell in the Spring and was exposed multiple times before they moved us out.
kechir,,gg1ywda,Ya I believe you - b/c is it NYC. Shit like that doesn't happen in red states like here in NC. This is Trump country. I wish I could get back some of those hours and days I spent looking into the hotel thing back in the spring. It was all a joke and a waste of time. Happy for you though - that is def how it ought to be.
kechir,,gg5q2g7,I'm in Montana. The local cop chaplain  runs a warming station. I mentioned  that we needed a local shelter. His response was " if we open a shelter here all the homeless people from the city will come down here. And we don't want that". He diddnt like my it's like Jesus said offer the meek aid in Jerusalem so they don't cone to Nazareth
kechir,,gg5qge4,That is awesome. I would be dead in 15 minutes in Montana. Holy crap I don't know how you do it. Makes me feel like a wimp here in NC.

kechir,,gg57c81,Yeah but the legislature is a bunch of wing-nut republicans who try as hard as they can to keep our governor from doing anything. I thank God we have an island of sanity in the otherwise ocean of backwards governors here in the South. Virginia is the state that really has things together. If I could just get up there.......
kechir,,gg3wbnz,I live in San Francisco. They placed many homeless people in empty hotel rooms here. (Our tourist industry was shut down due to the pandemic, so there were many empty rooms. The city paid the hotels to house people).
kechir,,gg56p3x,That is why it was (and has continued to be) so outrageous and frustrating. All of these huge empty hotels with nobody staying there and going unused while people have been out - with no way to stay safe, no way to keep from getting the virus, having to use public restrooms, not able to stay away from others who might have it. I walk past 5 enormous hotels every day and there has been nobody there for 9 months. It is so wrong.
kechir,gg274ic,,It‚Äôll get worse before it gets better.
kechir,gg8e0wr,,I was a Case Manager for a project like this back in April.  I went home crying everyday and ended having a mental breakdown and quitting.   The things I saw with on both ends is why I'll never be a case manager again.
kerauq,gg45v0u,,Genuinely depends on the person imo and experience. There's some fucked up crazy bums out there that'll pawn just about anything for a hit, way too unstable to hold a serious job and be a "contributing" member of society, sometimes they can't help it, sometimes they don't care. On the other hand there's people out their who are busting their balls, ovaries, etc to make it out here.They got dealt a shitty hand and are just doing the best they can with what they got. It's hard and unfortunately alot of people fall into a self destructive cycle. I personally appreciate any hand outs, hospitals that will actually help you and not throw you out based on your appearance, people willing to go out of their way to help out a stranger. I'm sure many others do too.
kerauq,,gg45zhq,Which type of person would you say is more common?
kerauq,,gg56to9,On a national scale I would say no one group is dominant. I think, however, that in some cities and states one group is more prevelant than the other. There tends to be more mentally ill and drug users in cities than in the country side because there are more resources for them there.
kerauq,gg49a8h,,The type that is just down on their luck and fighting to get up is far more prevelent. You do have a fair share of addicts and criminals and whatnot but you'd be surprised at the rest of us. A lot of abused women, old people, handicapped and chronically ill people end up in shelters. People lose everything to job loss, fires etc. Rising rents and not being able to keep a place is a very real thing in NYC, particularly for seniors.   I'm chronically ill and I lost my home to a disaster. Tree fell on my roof and I could not afford to fix it. I got very ill, almost died twice. I don't do chemicals. Worst addiction is chocolate but people always assume the worst. If I had a dollar for every time someone assumed that I was a "sinner" and that drugs or alcohol put me here I'd be loaded...
kerauq,gg4x99e,,Last two comments nail it. You cannot generalize about "the homeless". It is as lazy and useless as generalizing about people on any number of other criteria - race, age, gender, location, nationality, religion, etc....   I am not addicted to anything except caffeine. I don't use any sort of drug and don't drink or smoke either. Accidents, medical bills, disasters,  getting screwed-over, cheated, robbed, sued, fired, lied-about, etc.....there are a million paths to becoming homeless other than the first things people jump to.
kerauq,gg6bvua,,Your dad is not only completely wrong, he is also an absolute asshole. Addiction does not make someone not worth helping. Does cancer make someone unworthy of help? Sickness is not a choice.  Also, the reason why so many mentally ill people are on the streets is because of the lack of proper care. Some of us do not have access to the medication we need. Some of us want to get clean, but we can't without proper medical supervision and care (withdrawal). So what if the person spends the money you gave them on more drugs? If they don't they could die. Your dad, and everyone who has never been homeless/addicted honestly, needs to educate themselves. No one wants to be homeless. We all want a place to call home. Life is unfair, and we could make it fair but privileged people prefer to think that its our fault for being sick/homeless so that they don't have to live with the fact that it could be them in our place one day. I know because I have talked with people who used to think this way until they ran out of luck and privilege and ended up on the street. No one wants to believe it could be them until it is.
kerauq,gg4xxo1,,Unless you're someone that has been homeless for decades and honestly don't know any other way to live, no one, and I mean NO ONE, chooses to be homeless, wants to be homeless or ever wanted to be homeless.   Yes, it would appear that MOST or all of the homeless either suffer from drug addiction, alcohol dependency, &/or mental illness or some form of it. But, there are people that are not actively using drugs, or abusing alcohol, or have a formal diagnosis for mental illness.   Some people do end up enduring homelessness as a direct result from addiction, alcoholism, or mental incapacities and others end up homeless due to other unforeseen circumstances ie. Losing their career/job that they were barely surviving on as it was, a natural disaster to their home, being unlawfully evicted by their landlord, getting arrested regarding a criminal matter and being confined in jail, death of a loved one, dealing with crippling anxiety, suffering with debilitating depression, or landing in the hospital due to life-threatening injuries &/or illnesses. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, around 60% of the American population were living pay check to pay check and were 1 paycheck away from facing homelessness. I bet that percentage is much higher now.   In tandem with that, due to being newly homeless, some people do end up turning to drugs &/alcohol just to help, "deal," and cope with their unfortunate situation they're going through. On the other hand, the people that originally lost their home due to drug/alcohol abuse, those people end up just deciding to stay active in their addictions, because well, why not? What else is there to lose at this point?   A lot of the people that were addicts/alcoholics before becoming homeless, or ended up developing drug/alcohol dependency, they'll probably end up staying addicts. In addition, think about the individuals that became homeless due to mental illness, they're out there in the streets and more than likely, they're not receiving help or medication. People that weren't suffering from mental illness before homelessness, can or will, end up developing and ultimately suffering from some type of mental illness. I mean stop and think about it for a second....   Why wouldn't someone continue to be actively addicted to some substance(s) or end up developing an addiction or end up becoming mentally ill from homelessness? Why wouldn't they? When you've lost the place that YOU called, "home," your personal sanctuary, your safe place, your security (which also goes hand in hand with financial security), and then become exposed to the streets, exposed to the natural elements (it's terrible being homeless in Washington State; it rains a lot, the winters here are grueling and the summers are stifling), having your basic human needs taken away and not being able to properly function as a result, such as: restricted use and accessibility to a toilet, being able to shower/bathe, clean clothes and a washer/dryer, hot food and being able to prepare food, a warm place to sleep, and safety from others, just being able to be a, "functioning member of society," day in and day out, will take it's fucking toll. I mean not only are you fucking stripped away from your human essential + some, you always are stripped and eventually &/or unfortunately, of any shred of self-worth, dignity, decency, privacy etc.   It's all incredibly dehumanizing and demeaning, especially when others in the general community talk shit about ALL homeless people and automatically label them, degrade them, and judge their personal life and choices, instead of sympathizing/empathizing and helping to reduce the stigma that seems to be attached to homeless people as a whole and is seldomly ever based on that persons intentions and their character.   Everything I have said, it all comes from a place of unintentional, first-hand knowledge. I USED to be the person that would ridicule and judge people that were down on their luck and wouldn't be sympathetic to them whatsoever. But, since I personally lived like that (and am borderline, "I can be homeless any day." My fiance and I unfortunately are only able to have our home be a hotel room, we didn't meet the, "criteria/requirements," even though we had plenty of money, to move into a normal place. Living this way for 2.5 years now has been a very humbling and eye opening life experience and lesson. It's taught me a lot about myself, a lot about others, how to properly treat others etc. It's definitely made me a better person all around.   Please trust me when I say this:"NO ONE EVER, voluntarily chooses, or wants to be homeless and have to live an unorthodox/improved/impromptu life. No one! Believe me I would want nothing more than to just be able to, "go home." I haven't been able to, "go home," for a little over 2.5 years now. It never gets easier either.   I hope my opinion and personal anecdote helped changed your dads stance and viewpoints on homeless folks üôÉ
kdrg62,gfzfttl,,Lived for 8 months in a "Christian" mission in WA state that took money from the residents, donations of cash and goods from donators, and told them we were all lazy, on drugs, and didn't know Jesus and that's why we were poor.  They kept donations from us, and made us fill out requisition forms like it was the army. Embarrassing people into having to get cleared for soap, tampons, etc. They had a storeroom chock full of shelves of those items, plus nice blankets and baby items we never got at all because they decided we weren't worthy. Things well meaning donators thought they were helping us with out of sheer kindness.
kdrg62,,gfzp6n1,Sorry to hear this happened to you. I work in nonprofit homeless services in WA state and this kind of shit makes me so mad!!
kdrg62,,gg02652,Thank you. Not all the organizations I got services from in WA were awful, and that one was definitely the worst. Some were really good, and had truly kind staff, and sane systems. Some were good, and inspired, but flawed.  The particular mission I speak of was so mentally abusive and oppressive in nature that I wish I could tear it down brick by brick, because I feel like they hurt people.
kdrg62,,gg03ff1,I'm glad you had some positive experiences too. I can say that "good, inspired and flawed" is the best way to describe most nonprofit homeless services. The vast majority of the folks that do that kind of work truly want to help everyone as much as possible and will bend over backwards to help people keep or get into housing but often our hands are tied by the deeply flawed system we work in. Sending you good vibes friend, I hope you're safe and reasonably sheltered. üíì
kdrg62,,gg04nij,I am in a much better situation, now. Ty. :)  Believe me, I can still remember the faces of some of the awesome people that helped because they really, clearly just wanted to. In fact, we should probably be thanking more of you guys like we do with nurses, because in a similar way, you put caretaking first, and are barely compensated.  One night, my son, my partner at the time, and I were stuck with nowhere to go but the park. Talk about scary. After sleeping on the grass a couple hours, we were all gently woken by some sound. This guy is just standing there in a polo, around midnight or 1am, with plain, but nice plump hot dogs on buns, and bottled water. He was with a church or something that had a good program. Probably sounds either weird, or not special to hear about, but to us, he was like this miracle dude.
kdrg62,,gg0edl2,Our agency has an outreach team that does things just like that and the relationships they build with our unhoused folks are priceless. I am legitimately glad you and yours are in a better position now, especially with the cold weather coming.
kdrg62,,gg0msa4,I try when I can, to let wonderful people like yourself, & your colleagues know that you have an amazing impact, because when you're in the midst of the work, it can be hard to tell.   The people you help are struggling with fatigue, sometimes mental illness, and all the things that keep us from having much of a conversation about it while you're actually handing out socks, and ready to eat foods.   I'm sure you know, that some people's mental state will even cause them to seem caustic, rather than grateful. Even those people are positively impacted by what you do, even if they're fundamentally incapable of showing it.  Yeah, we aren't living a glamorous life, but we're warm and fed , and all I have to do to remember gratitude is to think back to those times, and the special people that helped us through it. :)
kdrg62,,gg1dnw6,Thank you for your kind words and this wonderful conversation. I wish you and yours all the best, stranger. üíö
kdrg62,,gg1ifqc,<3 :) Ty. All the best to you and yours, too.
kdrg62,,gfzz26n,This is really upsetting to hear not only how you and others were mistreated when at an esp low point but that there were donations that could have eased things a little for you all . I have given food / toiletries / baby items / pet food to my local food bank bc I figured they are more likely to get stuff to people .I use coupons and get free items that I can donate . This makes my hunch about donations to many private orgs not getting to the people who need them seem like maybe it was true . So sorry this happened to you and the others .
kdrg62,,gg03gu1,Some places were really good about passing along what was donated, and the donators were very kind, and giving, and we knew this, because we got the benefits of them. Don't be too discouraged. Just try your best to find out which places are really serving their people or not.  I lived at a tent city in WA state that was flawed, but extremely good in some ways. The people that donated were amazing, and the donations were passed along to the people. We got bus tickets, a camp phone & our porta potty was paid for by them, and we were given batteries. They also supplied some kitchen food, a hot meal each night, pocket warmers, aspirin, soap, blankets, and camping equipment. When we had a camper with special needs, like this guy that needed a coat that fit, he was "adopted" by a donating couple that took him out, and bought him what he needed.  It's a difficult thing to sort through, but it can be worth it.
kdrg62,,gg3mscz,Most "Christians" are like that. Not enough Christs around.
kdrg62,gfyj7pg,,Sorry to hear! What are the reasons they are using to deny you any help?
kdrg62,,gfyjd3f,Apparently the room im in isn't "licensed"
kdrg62,,gfyv4gd,What does that mean?  A licensed rooming house they're talking about?
kdrg62,,gfz99cq,Means hes renting a room and housing assistance doesnt help because it would be very easy for everyone to pull this scam off if they did. If a place isn't listed as a rental property for one reason or another (not zoned for it, duplex, etc) you dont qualify for this stuff. Something similar happened to me the first time I got out of homelessness. Its fucked up. You really dont have a way of knowing it, you'll sign a lease, be required rental insurance, live in an apartment complex... oh but for legal purposes it's a residence because it's cheaper for the property owner, so theyll insure you and then deny coverage, and you'll be shit out of luck when the shoe drops and your rental property is basically someone's house as far as the law sees it. And they want you to think that someone's kids claiming they're tenants is the issue when the issue is the path of least resistance fucks over the vulnerable again.
kdrg62,,gfyvz3e,I'm guessing.  I have no idea what they mean. And of course when they need donations they don't say anything about it
kdrg62,gfytt9b,,I‚Äôm a homeless veteran and none of the charities will help me because I have my dog.
kdrg62,,gfyygz9,The fuck? How any why does that even work? Is your dog considered a  asset? OMG.
kdrg62,,gfyyn7n,They say that I have to give him up. I‚Äôve had him since he was about 4 months old. In the six years since then, he has been by my side high and low
kdrg62,,gfz4fph,Call him your service dog.
kdrg62,,gfz7r73,I run an animal rescue and we have a relationship with a few homeless and DV orgs here where we will try our damndest to find a short or long time foster for someone‚Äôs pet so they can more quickly and easily access certain services or housing until a more permanent solution can be found.   We‚Äôll typically spay/neuter and vaccinate if needed, provide basic vetting or address any other medical issues they may have, etc. too. Owner and foster then work out visitation together.  If a situation like that might be workable for you in such a way that would allow you access to more services or housing, you might consider asking local rescues if they might be able to help (it‚Äôs not *super* uncommon for rescues to do this sort of thing in situations like this).  Finding a foster (and resources, depending on what you can contribute toward care) can be very difficult and doesn‚Äôt usually happen immediately, so if they can‚Äôt help, be understanding.  Then ask if they might have any other resources or suggestions for you, and if they might be able to help promote your situation on their social medias and within their rescue network.  We‚Äôve done this before too by holding a fundraiser to raise money for any vet expenses and to support the animal‚Äôs care while they‚Äôre being fostered, and/or to try and locate someone not within our immediate foster network who might be willing to step up to foster with our sponsorship (the rescue will help vet them first - they won‚Äôt just hand off your pup to anyone, and we let the owner have a final say on if they feel comfortable with the person or not).  Our *only* requirements are that the animal is spayed/neutered and vaccinated (doesn‚Äôt matter whether that‚Äôs already been done by the time you come to us, or whether we sponsor it after), they receive parasite treatment while in foster care, and any life-threatening medical issues, or issues that significantly impact quality of life if left untreated, are addressed. And these will be typical requirements for any rescue that *can* help, too. All other vetting is up to the owner, and we‚Äôll gladly do it or raise the funds if needed.  We typically find short/ish term fosters for people in similar situations as you about 6x a month, and long term fosters 1-2x a month. We currently have 5 animals at our own home right now that we‚Äôre caring for long term who belong to people who are homeless, as well as a DV victim. Wish we could do more, but we‚Äôre a foster-only rescue (no shelter), and people willing to foster in general are hard to come by.  Not sure if any of this is helpful to you, but I figured it might be worth mentioning.  Edit: If you do consider going this route, I would start reaching out ASAP. It‚Äôll be baby season soon, and fosters will be even more scarce come April.
kdrg62,gfz8pql,,As some one who spent most of their  career with non profits I concur. Ive seen millions pocketed, my favorite is the low income neighborhood they rejuvenated so now people can not afford to live there. Oh and the city started cleaning out the camps this week happy holidays y‚Äôall!
kdrg62,,gfza64l,Message me the deets. I've started up a blog and would like to write about this.
kdrg62,gfzayo3,,The assisted housing commission in my town is in a building named with my first/middle/last names. Irony.    I was on a waiting list for 30ish years. Just became old enough to get kicked off that list and moved to the bottom of the senior's list. I'll be dead when they call, if ever.    Not really what you asked, just wanted to vent a little.
kdrg62,gfzjnfr,,Every homeless service that suppose to help people get off the streets have refused to help because I don't have a local connection. They claim to help homeless people yet they're refusing to help the homeless, so pissed off with them not giving a damn.
kdrg62,gfzl71n,,This is why so many people are living in cars, tents and cardboard boxes.
kdrg62,gfz46on,,The problem with charities and nonprofit foundations in America these days is that the rules regulating them have been loosened so much that they're no longer pipelines to the needy but are instead just another way for the rich to stuff their own pockets at taxpayer expense. They can pump all the money through "suppliers" and their own payroll, not give the real mission of the charity a fucking dime and still not be in violation of any laws.  It's fucking disgusting and the graft reaches into the billions.  For a representative example of the breed, look no further than the Clinton Foundation.
kdrg62,,gfz5hsp,Capitalism has figured out to totally depoliticize it's subjects and then buttresses that with the Nonprofit Industrial Complex.  Depoliticize, meaning that things once in the realm of public debate, are removed and replaced with 'services' (provided by the slush fund for rich people ie = nonprofit).    The nonprofit provides legitimate cover and guilt's people, until donating and serve as an illegitimate authority.  So Capitalism profits twice, they disempower the citizenry to vote for the things they actually deserve, you know like an actual safety net, while not paying taxes AND steering that industry in whatever direction they choose -since whoever has the largest organization/funding sets the agenda.  All the while 'normal' people think 'everything is taken care of'.
kdrg62,,gfza9dp,Excellent analysis, I couldn't say it better!
kdrg62,,gfzbhyj,Yes, very eloquently put.
kdrg62,gfzwgxh,,So many charities are frauds.
kdrg62,gg17gd4,,This is why I wear a hidden camera and publish whatever information I can get. Ignorant humans have these conditions to make a buck, and are almost always of the same race. Shit like this is why I keep saying big cities are best for getting out of homelessness. Never saw this shit in a big city.
kdrg62,,gg3aoth,Sure you do, buddy. In between all your other unbelievable ventures, right?
kdrg62,gg13axi,,The first sentence of this post = Raleigh, NC. So I am not the only one and I am not crazy. Thank you.
kdrg62,gg006eg,,Do you think the ratings on a site like CharityNavigator are accurate?  (they let you search charities' tax documents, salaries, etc more easily)
kdrg62,,gg00fvr,They get the money and taxes correct I belive but if a charity has "god" or some form of Christian word in it its almost always a very good rating even though they probably do some bad things
kdrg62,gg01v4s,,How do I help?.   Serious ?.  I am blessed with what I have.  I don't deserve a damn bit of it either.  So how does a random guy help ?

kdrg62,gg0ij17,,Avoid having an eviction on your record by all means. Leave ASAP. I know it‚Äôs probably easier said than done though.
kd44a7,gfvkro0,,Welcome to the grind. Best advice I can offer:  1. Humble yourself. Alot of others have been roughing it far longer, to them you're fresh meat.  They don't know you and most who are out there are alot tougher than you'd think. Not trying to intimidate, just trying to tell you nicely before the streets force you to learn it. 2. Look into learning as much about local resource centers as you can. Learning where and what time  your local Soup Kitchens are is a priority. 3. Donation Giveaway Centers; places that help with clothing, hygiene products. Stuff like that. Those places will prove invaluable. 4. Build a friendly repor with your local homeless. I'm not saying be best buds with the methhead up the road, I'm saying don't be an absolute stranger.   Regardless of what you may think of the homeless, they're people just like you. Only difference is the paths in life that you walk. One of the biggest problems many people have is not accepting the situation. Don't fight it.  Acknowledge that this is your life right now. It doesn't have to be permanent. But you can use this experience to grow and learn as a person. Adaptation is powerful. Learn to adapt to what life throws at you. Homelessness gets harder the more you refuse to accept it. Your not in a comfy cushy bed anymore. Get used to it or it'll break you down in self pity and woe.  Some things to think of immediately: 1: Shower/bathing. If you have a gym membership, you'll want to keep that. If you don't, look into getting one. Keeping up on hygiene can make or break you. It's very important. 1.2: If you have a friend or family member that will let you use their shower, do not hesitate to ask. If a shower is offered. Take it greatfuly. 2: Make sure you can get sleep. Sleep is essential. If you can't think straight your as useless to yourself as a screen door in a hurricane. Sleeping bags and tents are decent shelter depending on terrain. Abandoned buildings are also doable but be careful. In and out, and being seen. 3: Shelter life is prison life. Regardless, even in warming shelters you are treated like a criminal or a pos. It's sad. But the system was never designed to help anyone. You'll learn that the more you talk to other homeless. If you insist on shelters, good luck. 4: Stashing stuff is much better than hauling everything on your back. You're not superman. Get a tarp, use that to sheild your back pack or suitcase (clothes) from the weather. Carry only essentials. 5: Wrap your important paperwork in plastic bags or laminate them. Clear packing tape layered on documents is a cheap way to laminate things like a social security card, birth certificate, citizenship paperwork. All that is invaluable. If you lose that, it'll set you back years. And costs far too much time and money to replace. Any other documents, take photographs of or scan into an online back up, like the cloud or Google photos. You don't need useless paper weighing you down. 6: Your cellphone is exponentially useful. However, it is not weatherproof. The elements, like cold will destroy your battery life. Invest into getting a decent phone case like an OtterBox. Cracked screens will happen. Invest in getting a portable battery or power bank. Outlets and electricity are scarce and few and far in between. In life or death, it can literally mean life or death. 7: Cleaning your clothes is imperative. Programs vary place to place but if there aren't any, you can always hand wash them. A sink at McDonald's bathroom, or a truck stop always helps. You don't have to wash your laundry every week, and you don't need to be styling. But you will get dirty. 8: Income. You're going to need money. If you have a job, do everything to keep it. And save up your money like a squirrel storing nuts for winter. The more money you save, the quicker you can get out of homelessness. Check panhandling ordinances and laws in your areas. Fly a sign if you can. Be grateful, what you get is what you get. 9: Mail. It's a b*tch, but see about getting a po box. If you can't get mail, your not considered a citizen to most company's or businesses. Sad but true. 8: The police are not your friend. You are no longer a taxpayer. They will in most cases only want to get an easy arrest on you. DO NOT let them know you are homeless. Once your on law enforcements radar, they'll constantly be on yours. 9: STAY SOBER! I cannot stress this enough. Stress of homelessness is hard, but getting inebriated just to feel better will only make things worse. It's worse than lack of sleep. If you were/are on drugs. Check into a rehab. They'll help way more than any shelter. 10: When it comes to opposition, you'll get alot of it from all angles. People hate the homeless because they're terrified of winding up in the same position. Don't stress it, focus on you. They want to see you freak out or fail. Don't give them what they want.  Good luck, hope this helps. And the most important thing is this; Everything is a learning opportunity. When the world pushes don't say "why me?" lift your head up and say "try me!" Look at everything as a challenge not a problem. And don't focus on the negative, there's a sense of realism in saying "it could be worse" because regardless of outlook, yeah it sucks. But if your smart and strong. It's temporary.  It's only after we've lost everything, that we realize we can do anything. God speed, welcome to the grind.
kd44a7,,gfvnh7a,This is such good advise practical yet specific. Bless you for sharing
kd44a7,,gfwn84a,That's, uh, the best time I've had reading a long text on reddit.
kd44a7,,gfxxhj2,Great advice.....   Some of my ‚Äúten commandments of homelessness‚Äù include  -no hard drugs  -no one uses your phone, for anything  -stay clean and hydrated  -no stealing (if you get caught your life takes a BIG hit)
kd44a7,gfuy0lm,,211. Find a shelter. If you have a vehicle lmk I can give you lots of pointers on roughing it or vehicle sleeping.
kd44a7,,gfv3oqr,I don't have a car. Right now I just have target for shelter until it closes
kd44a7,,gfwdqvd,Call 211. They will connect you with shelter services. That should be step 1. Roughing it is kind of advanced homelessness, you'll need to be prepared.  I feel for you. I've been there. 211 and going to a shelter is your safest option assuming you dont have any family or friends to take you in. From there things get a lot worse before they get better.
kd44a7,,gfvup2w,There are resources. If there aren‚Äôt any near you, set the goal to get to a city that has them. Do you have things to sell? Try to put together a backpack of essentials‚Äîsleeping bag, toiletries, etc. I‚Äôm in Los Angeles and there are many good resources here for food, temp shelter, medical care, vet care, and a path to permanent housing. There are hoops to jump through but ultimately you can start life again without having all your energy going to surviving. Good luck. Don‚Äôt give up.
kd44a7,gfubskx,,Call your local Salvation Army. My mother volunteers for one and at the one she is at put people up for emergency homelessness, like at a motel for a night or so. Look up the closest homeless shelter to you, read everything about it because some are very strict about what time you have to be there. I don‚Äôt know where you are so I can‚Äôt make any other recommendations.
kd44a7,,gfubyhq,I wonder if they have something for people who work at night and need sleep during the day.
kd44a7,,gfurjsr,I am afraid that may severely limit your options. I had to camp in the woods and fortunately could shower at work.
kd44a7,gfuqv0v,,I'm sorry that was done to you.   If you have a car that runs you have mobile shelter and if you also have a smartphone you can make money driving for Grub Hub.   If you don't have anything at all seek out your nearest Food Not Bombs chapter and they will definitely feed you and probably give you a tent and sleeping bag as well.   Be wary of trusting strangers, particularly other unhoused.   Personally I'd avoid the Starvation Army or the Look-down-on-you Rescue Missions unless you want a headful of lice and all your best stuff stolen.  Good luck, coyote
kd44a7,gfuz33o,,Evicted right before Christmas. Interesting times we live in

kd44a7,,gfvyzm4,Yeah I'll probably end up in the woods

kd44a7,,gfw0cbp,That's pretty cool
kd44a7,,gfw200g,yeah!! i lived up there a few years ago
kd44a7,,gfw29ij,I would be scared lol
kd44a7,,gfw2euk,scared?
kd44a7,,gfw2hg8,It's literally a cabin in the woods lol
kd44a7,,gfw69t3,its cozy af ü§£
kd44a7,,gfw825u,Until some country bumpkin decides to wake you up with a chainsaw
kd44a7,gfv9228,,The most important part is staying clean
kd44a7,,gfv9uhq,Yeah I'll have to check gyms out for showers I think.
kd44a7,,gfveemz,Ahhh I meant drugs lol
kd44a7,gfv6bzd,,I truly, honestly feel like I am well on my way to your position.  I hope you the best and will be following your account.
kd44a7,,gfv6q5t,Thanks.
kd44a7,gfvfkaj,,What you do depends on where you are. The most urgent need is shelter to sleep.  Are you comfortable getting a tent and urban camping? Depending on where you are (weather as well as local cops‚Äô attitudes) that could range from suicidal to downright cozy.
kd44a7,,gfvz42z,Yeah I'm in a city but I think I'll get the bus to the less populated areas and camp
kd44a7,,gfvzgym,Walmart will sell you a tent & 2 tarps for about $50.
kd44a7,,gfvzr5i,Nice
kd44a7,,gfvzwl8,Do you know what all supplies you‚Äôll need? What about the things you already owned before eviction, are they in storage or just lost or what?
kd44a7,,gfw087j,I was renting a room so I didn't have much. I have a few bags of clothes and some personal things but not much else. I have to start over from nothing.
kd44a7,,gfw0smi,Alright so you have to find a place to keep that shit. I rent a storage unit with my unemployment money, and all my paperwork, my bank card, birth certificate etc, plus the few kitchen tools I have (I‚Äôm a cook in normal times so those are the only nice things I have) are in there. My clothes are in there, except what I‚Äôm wearing and I just visit it to get supplies every day or every other day. you can NOT keep anything in your tent you‚Äôre not prepared to lose, because tbh it‚Äôs inevitable that it‚Äôll get robbed, or thrown away, or otherwise lost.  Do you have any cash income or just ebt?
kd44a7,,gfw189k,Right now just ebt. I lost my job a while back and tried to get unemployment myself but it's been like 2 months now and I don't think it's going to happen.
kd44a7,,gfw1np2,Hmm you gotta panhandle then friend. Get a sign and a coffee cup and some hand sanitizer and go stand by the freeway entrance. You‚Äôll have a cozy camp in no time.
kd44a7,,gfw288u,Good idea I never tried it
kd44a7,gfvk4r6,,If you don‚Äôt mind me asking ? How old are you ?
kd44a7,,gfvz66t,I'm 22
kd44a7,gfwr5rn,,Please let us know how you are, keep us updated. Try and find services in your local area, food banks as an example. A gym membership may be useful as you can shower there etc. You will get through this tough time ‚ù§
kd44a7,gfxmb2g,,I'm in the exact same position starting the 28th. There's a local place that usually helps with rental assistance (first months rent and security deposit) but apparently that stopped December 1st, even though when I called last week they said to call back once I found a place (I have a couple possible rooms but wanted to see if they helped with private rentals).   Just started a new job too :( Being homeless in the middle of winter in VA is going to fucking suck ya'll.
kd44a7,,gfxtdj1,Yes, it is very cold here...but God always provides. üôèüíõ
kd44a7,,gfxwhjn,Yeah, at least there is a day shelter here with showers and stuff that will be super helpful, if I can manage to get into a shelter at night and keep my job it should take maybe a month to save for rent/deposit and I'll be OK.
kd44a7,gg0w001,,Is anyone here? In ny ? I have a home for free?
kd44a7,,gg0w39p,I don't understand.
kd44a7,,gg0wnr5,I have a home, I‚Äôm moving 1/15, it‚Äôs on ling island , 3 bedroom, I‚Äôm clean, leave twin bed possibly dresser behind. It‚Äôs yours for free if in ny.
kd44a7,,gg0wzk1,I'm sorry but I'm pretty far away. But thank you for the offer.
kd44a7,,gg4cvgm,I understand, to good to be true. Rent free 3 bedroom. Paying it foward. I spent 7yrs homeless with 2 children , it was the hardest thing I have ever gone thou, trying to save the pain , pay it foward, this home , allowed me to wait out my voucher save down payment for voucher and moving costs, help my disabled child get her weighted prosthetic, who is also visually impaired, from a tramadic brain injury.I may be hesitant to in another state. It‚Äôs free no rent , 3 bedrooms. Leaving sc and one bed behi d. Please stay safe. If u change your mind , please reach out, their are so many programs here in ny , Long Island. I know them all , i will guide you, if you need, someone special saved my life, trying to pay it foward
kd44a7,,gg4cynn,So either e special saved me snd my disabled child a d her sister, 7 yrs I spent out ther. I‚Äôm just trying to pay it foward as I promised a dying man in 2010.

kd44a7,,gg95d0k,Ya I will be 67 in my car !
kd44a7,gfuu0bl,,I was homeless 2 times. I was able to use several things from this blog by an homeless activist. It's old but gets to the point. The only improvement I did was made a stove out of tin cans. Then, improve that to rocket stoves. Youtube has vids on those. Good luck.  http://guide2homelessness.blogspot.com/2004/10/introduction-to-project.html
kd44a7,gfzwijy,,What state are you in?
kcxr1v,gftui1y,,So t that take it away from people who need it and possibly cause the program to end when so e people point out that the system is being abused
kcxr1v,,gftxlgf,Then we would have better position to support more people when it used widespread
kcnshl,gfrzcdg,,Bring out some coffee and see if you can strike up a conversation. Introduce yourself. They might need help getting rid of the trash? lol Always treat others with respect.   Edit; yeah I meant morning coffee.
kcnshl,,gfs2nyt,I would only do that during the day. You don‚Äôt want to freak people out by standing by their tent in the middle of the night.
kcnshl,gfrn92g,,> I couldn't tell if they legitimately didn't want to talk much, or were worried that if they were discovered they'd be kicked out, or were just surprised.   I can almost certainly guarantee they're worried about being kicked out.  As for what you should do, there are a few factors to consider.  &#x200B;  Are they on your property? are they harassing other neighbors? are they presenting some kind of danger that would cause has significant harm?     If the answer is no, then you'd be well within your rights to let them be.     If you choose too, you may want to offer them work, shoveling snow or doing yard work, something like that. Maybe even offer them work somewhere with a day labor agency.     If you choose to, you might consider giving them leftovers,  or inviting them to a bbq.
kcnshl,,gfsiocu,Perhaps even offer them a shower? I know that could be weird letting them into your house but maybe you could set up one of those camping showers with hot water. When I was homeless it was horrible not being able to shower. I‚Äôll never forget my first shower after getting off the streets. It was heavenly.
kcnshl,,gft99wf,this is the way. The most helpful thing you could do is allow them to use your shower once a week. Do you have a washer/dryer? Because that would also be huge.
kcnshl,,gfthelf,Good one! Washer/dryer + shower access really would change a LOT for your average homeless person. Socks are the #1 requested item at homeless shelters. Why socks? Because homeless people don‚Äôt have access to washer/dryers so they wear the same socks to the point that they belong in the trash maybe even a biohazard bin because they get so gross after wearing the same pair for 1 or 2 weeks+.   Having clean clothes and a clean body would dramatically increase their chance to apply for jobs and get off the streets (if that‚Äôs their prerogative, FYI some people genuinely like that life).
kcnshl,gfs93ow,,They sound like they're on the up and up and are probably terrified of being known. Being known quickly leads to being harassed by police.  The best thing you could do is bring them some hot food and let them know you dont give two shits about them being on the property.
kcnshl,gfspz6h,,I've been homeless for two years, and im telling you, they are just freaking out on the inside but trying to feign nonchalance of being discovered, because to be seen by those who stay in the neighborhood, at any capacity or age group, could mean a number of serious consequences which could result in code enforcement coming to bulldoze (cleaning a camp site, they claim) trespass you, & send you away with only a few moments of frenzied unplanned packing, refusal to be able to take your tent down, and them taking a picture of you, the unspoken threat of harsher handling & even possible jailtime if we are ever seen by their lot again....it would suck in the winter, to put it mildly. Not to mention, those who live in the houses are usually shocked, suspicious, loose lipped with the knowledge of the camp, etc etc.  another likely result of the loose lips,  someone's told the neighborhood busybody, Alice, th we location of the site, which she casually mentions at dinner to her adolescent daughter, with contrived catastrophic incredulity...thats better than a red light for the kid to go explore, find camp, take what he wants, and tells all his friends about the cool place he found in the woods... Tbh, its a mess. Just kind of stay in the background for a minute. If they look self containing and interested in only survival/concealment, small talk about light subjects or questions  whatever they're working on (that moment[hobo hackz). Treat em like a human beinf, an equal, it makes all the difference
kcnshl,gfsvbgf,,I would be on edge that someone will be trying to boot me any minute if I stayed in the same place every night. Have a campfire and cook some food->friends.
kcnshl,gftewkn,,So lots of great advice Here.1st off, thanks for not forgetting that this doesn‚Äôt mean these are bad or dangerous people. they might be, or they might be kids, or they might be all manner of things, but you have an open mind which is great.  ‚Äòthe 1st thing to do is introduce yourself and tell them your boundaries ask what theirs are.      I suggest hot coffee early in the morning, maybe sunrise.    be as nice as you can and just go give them to go cups if you have them or mugs and ask they return them To your door or offer to come get them.   maybe say if they have any trouble with mentally unstable people you can come help, tell them you‚Äôve been there and tell them a story where you were roughing it and somone helped, so they get that you are just helping so the world is better, not so you can get sex slaves or anything.   Feel them out, and take your time.if you know the area, maybe give them some advice about any neighbor that might be a threat or a nearby cafe or laundry place ect.   If you decide to help them more, you could now but  need to feel them out 1st, and I recommend you take your time, a few days at least, to decide on these people.  most of all, other then tips about the area, don‚Äôt give advice. You don‚Äôt know what problems they have and the last thing a street person needs to hear is how they can go do x when they already tried several versions of x and it didn‚Äôt work.
kcnshl,,gfvn4mb,Sorry but if someone walked up on me and  Started taking sex slave shit and weird.  Stuff like you mentioned.  I would get the, He‚Äôll away from them lol
kcnshl,gfs31rs,,Let them move in with you

kb1hiv,gfdwp2c,,Very glad to hear that you won't be freezing your ass off for the forseeable future. I've never been in the position of living in a tent. I have however had to live in a vehicle for an extended period of time. I know how much that sucked. Being 6' tall and trying to sleep in a standard cab, 5 speed Ford Ranger along with everything you own was not a fun experience.   Anyway, I don't have much money or anything, but if there is anything you can think of that I might be able to help you with and make your life a little bit easier, don't hesitate to shoot me a message and let me know. Take care, be safe.
kb1hiv,,gfdy0up,Thanks.
kb1hiv,,gfillvb,I'm 5'10 and spent a year in a geo metro. Funny thing I had a ranger I got with a camper the year before. I sold the camper and the truck ended up a undone project

kb1hiv,gfinck4,,If you could heat up some stones and put them in the tent somewhere safe they will give off heat overnight. If one rodent get too hot you could use it like a bed warmer. Just a idea I haven't actu done it but the science is there
kb1hiv,,gfmcm7g,Wrap hot stones in a towel or shirt and use it to keep your feet warm in your sleeping bag.  If your feet are warm, your body will be warm.  Also, be sure and wear a hat to bed.  Best of luck to you.

kazqz4,,gfhfo2k,I‚Äôm not the person they‚Äôre talking about that was arguing with OP but I was the one that showed the screenshot.  Basically, There was another post that was saying white women don‚Äôt have access to any resources since they aren‚Äôt a minority.  OP commented saying something like, how as a black man, he agreed and that all the resources get taken up by African Americans.  A couple of days later OP posted something about how some black men were being racist towards him and that‚Äôs when another commenter called him out about the previous comment about being black   OP denied it and was really rude to this other commenter, accusing him of making up lies.   I had seen this and I also remembered the comment thread so I posted a screenshot defending the commenter.  OP eventually deleted the whole post.   I mean...I guess it‚Äôs not out of the ordinary that some may lie online about aspects of their lives to keep things private, but the way OP pretended to be a person of color just for the sake of pushing some agenda just seemed not cool.   *kanye shrug*

kakkln,gfb4era,,So they'll spend money to keep homeless people homeless instead of spending money to help them no longer be homeless...
kakkln,,gfb6nra,Yep. It's not about money or the lack of it, being cruel is what they're after.
kakkln,,gfbptu0,Protecting their safety as they approach to investigate. They fear for their lives, a homeless rabid animal may burst out of the tiny shelter and spit on them and give them aids.  Cops are all about, show me your hands!, and do you have any weapons!, and down on the ground!, for *their* safety. Its all about how safe they feel before they put a knee on the back of your neck.
kakkln,,gfdfcgc,Yeah they're always"in fear of their lives" eventhough they've been militarized, wear protective armor, carry guns, tazers and other weapons and are trained.       Years ago when I was homeless, I was charged with assault and battery of an officer, using a weapon-  a shod foot among some other charges. They wanted, and tried to give me 10 years for it. The officer claimed I kicked him hard enough to caused him bodily injuries that he needed treatment for. What really happened was he attacked me and threw me on my head giving me an open head wound. When he tackled me, taking me off my feet, he fell onto my leg shattering my knee and knocking me unconscious and cuffed and shackled me and threw me in the police car. He was so pissed I'd bled all over the back off the cruiser he dragged me out and kicked me breaking 2 of my ribs. He never booked me or put me in a cell, instead he kept me in the garage of the PD and him and several other cops taunted me all night calling me names and beating me. They offered no medical attention at all. When my mom got me in the morning she brought me to the hospital. The hospital was mortified by what they'd done to me and called the FBI because they obviously couldn't call the cops. Internal investigation did nothing. I've got a TBI I suffer from now and I have panic attacks around officers.    This happens everyday to normal people. The homelessness is all the excuse they needed because you aren't looked at like a human being anymore. During that time I was spit on countless times, attacked, beaten, called names, had things thrown at me and utterly degraded and disrespected. Something desperately needs to be done to help people that are homeless.
kakkln,,gfemevb,Absolutely and so sorry you had to go thru all that. It enrages me so much the way they treat the homeless compared to other segments of society. I have witnessed it too, so many times.  I was always on my guard around cops that were jacking me up for 'sleeping outdoors'.  Thats how I survived, by remaining compliant, yes sir and no sir, whatever you say, sir. The good cops will run you around, make you jump thru hoops then leave, the bad ones are looking for somebody to victimize.  Thank you so much for sharing that horrifying experience, I hope it helps others to understand how difficult it can be out there.
kakkln,,gfhqekc,Thank you I appreciate the kind words. Unfortunately most people will never see the world how it really is but sometimes all you need is one single person to hear and understand to start a chain reaction of empathy.
kakkln,,gfiuuh2,George Floyd, for instance? Everyone was so upset, for a while.. They even gassed peaceful demonstrators in front of the White House.
kakkln,,gfpzqjf,George was a drug addict. Kelly Thomas was a homeless son of a cop who another cop beat to death on camera. No charges no protests no cities set on fire.
kakkln,,gfqta0y,Have to go back to Kent State to elicit a response from Americans.
kakkln,,gfcwr7o,Oh, its all about money. Property values and taxes from that. Homeless camps, jungles and encampments like this are bad for property values.
kakkln,,gfew8a2,Anyone who cares more about "property values" than people is antisocial and shouldn't have their opinions catered to.
kakkln,,gfglr92,I agree. Sad thing is those doing often delude themselves into thinking they are good people.
kakkln,gfb7gbo,,The bottom line is the city shelter system wants these people in the shelters so they can make money off them. If they can sustain themselves the shelters don't get money every month for housing them or for placing them into permanent housing. I've had social workers and supervisory personnel scuttle better living situations for me on purpose so I would be forced to stay at one particular shelter.   I'm 2 years in one now and I have disability and a city voucher. They're not exactly rushing to find me housing and they won't change my classification to make it easier for me to. They are telling me to vet any housing I might find on my own through them. If they don't approve it I'm not supposed to take it.   So far I've only gotten my small back pay checks but I have one coming in June that is more than enough to get me out of here and if they have not helped me to get affordable housing by then I don't care. I'm gone. The way I see it they are holding me back with their crap and using me to make money for the system.   When I first hit the shelter system they told me the average stay was 9 months. Uhuh, not if you are disabled. 3, 4 even 5 years is not uncommon. Affordable housing isn't very and they stall things, hold you back for as long as they can from what I can tell. They asked me the other day about Assisted Living, which is basically a nursing home set up where they take nearly all your money and make you live in a room with at least one other person.   I'm too young for that and no way I'm giving them my whole check and living somewhere where I am not allowed to have all my stuff, have my cat, have friends over, etc. My friend who is in it now says she has nothing left, not even enough to pay her phone and locker with what little funds she's allowed to retain. They got her to agree while she was in the hospital half out of it after surgery on some medication and now she's totally regretting it and trying to get back out.   I would like a studio or an SRO type room with a kitchenette and a bathroom. I don't really want roommates I don't know very well. I've been ID thefted twice and had all my stuff stolen while I was hospitalized by a roommate, but I will go there if I have to. Whatever works on my budget. Just get me out of the shelter system for good....
kakkln,,gfb8qaw,Exactly. Our country makes a living housing inmates, homeless,  disabled and ‚Äútroubled‚Äù folks. The last thing they want is to find a solution. Medication and paperwork are their go-to tricks for squeezing more out of us.  I do see some younger and older people finding symbiotic living arrangements where the tenant assists with childcare; does Secretary work for home office; gardens or does yard work. For older and disabled folks, helping older children with homework or supervision, and caring for pets can be a possibility. Most of these situations need a level of trust but it is possible if you are near communities that are accustomed to communal living and shared living spaces.
kakkln,,gfbcxae,This was very close to my expeirence in Canada. It‚Äôs true that borders only exist for the poor -the rich set up the same cash trap systems and all know each other. And, are mostly evil in my sadly extensive experience
kakkln,,gfceeft,Well that post was an education for me. I'm disgusted by what our system does to the vulnerable.
kakkln,gfbl772,,I've told people in America a million times that homelessness is a land access issue not a structure scarcity issue.  Somehow it doesn't make sense to Americans very often.

kakkln,gfe1lm9,,This hurts.
kakkln,gfcb7ra,,That's evil. [L.A. is trying to do something similar. ](https://www.hopeofthevalley.org/tinyhomes/) I hope it actually works out.
kakkln,gfb5kx8,,Every year a group, usually students who think they're the first to come up with it, will do this, have their work dismantled, then whine outrage. But they'll never come together to change the laws, only suffer the personal indignation to their moral ego and move on.   Not discarding the intent, but there is a hierarchical condescension that this keeps happening because somehow they don't think we're clever enough to come up with the idea of tiny homes, not that we don't do it because we know it will be taken from us.
kakkln,,gfb6sdr,That‚Äôs not very easy for some broke 20 year olds to do though, building houses with small cash is a bit easier for college students and people living in shared apartments. Remember that the people helping the poor are those that are either in the same situation as them or were recently/ yea we should change the laws but that is not their fault. It‚Äôs the government‚Äôs. The only thing that this camp needed was a piece of private property to keep gov out
kakkln,,gfblu96,Private property is subject to code enforcement.  These will not meet code to be human inhabited.  Ergo, even having private property would not protect this.   Folks should have or could have known that from the start.
kakkln,,gfcuzqy,[deleted]
kakkln,,gfeerob,What a lot of people don't realize is the current 21st century homelessness problem is very much linked/is an echo to 20th century code regulations and housing enforcement.  Tenements, SROs, and a whole bouquet of "affordable" low-frills housing options *used to* exist aplenty.   Where do we imagine poor-as-shit immigrants were spending the night after getting dropped off on Ellis Island?  So where did those go?  Killed by gentrification, NIMBY-ism, jingoism, anti-immigrant sentiments, and all the rest.  The most recent very profound gentrification of American city centers -- from the 1990s to present -- was the last death blow for many of those old affordable housing options that barely still existed (Salt Lake City's last SRO was destroyed in like 2012 or so) and one would not be given a permit to build a new one, there is no support for that.  As of now, at least, people in USA seem to prefer to let shantytowns emerge -- with their accompanying health and safety issues -- as opposed to building permanent appropriate housing for very low-income and zero income folks like Americans did many generations ago.  So code enforcing on your land-owning friend is merely a "consistent" enforcement of these codes. You aren't even allowed to build a "dormitory"-style housing for homeless folks -- in which say two folks share a room and an entire floor shares a bathroom and kitchenette.  City councils would approve the building for rich college kids, but would deny the same type of building to poor people <shrug>.
kakkln,,gff6o21,So sad and infuriating. If a building was built first for college kids, or as a hostel, and then became ‚Äúfree‚Äù what would the response most likely be?
kakkln,,gff8wji,To be entirely fair the situation, adults with special needs and those who present special hazards to those around them are over represented in the group of people who are very low income and zero income. Which means you can't just move the college kids out, move the homeless folks in, and have harmony.   Bedlam is a real possibility if the people who have special needs and present special hazards aren't given proper support.   But I often make the comparison to college undergraduates.  I  argue homeless folks' emergency shelters should be like undergraduate dormitories in terms of accommodations and support staff. The barracks-style homeless shelters make the problem of homelessness much worse.
kakkln,,gfewwjt,Really? Then how are these being used all over as shelter for the homeless? Building codes aren't the same everywhere and I'm pretty sure the rules are different for emergency shelter.
kakkln,,gfeya89,where is "all over"?    Second, sympathetic executives in this enclave or that may choose to *not* destroy a village like this, but they certainly have the power if they wish to.  Also, NIMBYs sometimes force the hand of local leaders to do so. I would advise do-gooders to know which kind of community they are in before they waste their time building lil structures.   Third, in the USA at least, the same executives I already referred to have boundless power to cite "public health and safety" to curtail basically *all* constitutional rights held by citizens, including the right to assembly or the right to be secure in their persons and property. All rights are limited.  Like, there is no 1st Amendment nor 4th Amendment right that can overpower a mayor's ability to say "this shantytown is unsafe and must be removed."   But 'tis true there may be an enclave here or there that tolerates these things.  But in the USA, the greatest bastions of liberalism are the big cities, and the big cities clear out homeless shantytowns constantly.
kakkln,,gfb8szu,The private property issue has also been done again and again. Sans a dozen or so tiny home communities that various [cities](https://tinyhousetalk.com/portland-greenlights-tiny-homes-for-homeless/) have allowed and   sanctioned (meaning police will not harass and basic utilities are permitted), it's always NIMBY. Private property is never really private when you're surrounded by snobs. The government is the people, so even if people choose to blame the government, it represents the interest of those whom it fears.   And as for those few small tiny home communities, they were established by homeless, built by homeless, for homeless. Many of the houses are transitional for those who are only temporarily transient, while others stay long term and work in the tiny home village.   Apart from that, due to events this year, there is a squatter's rights uprising slowly happening, and all those empty investment properties that well outnumber the homeless population will at some point be addressed in the near future.
kakkln,,gfbft22,Seems like the methods by which those sanctioned ones where created is pretty important to study and replicate
kakkln,gfbjr7g,,This is why you buy private property near a bus stop, and build these capsules there. Everyone and their grandma wants to get upset when government steps in, no ine wants to step on government.
kakkln,,gfbl9za,Government will still shut you down for code violations health and safety etc.
kakkln,,gfbld4e,Not if you go far enough.
kakkln,,gfcp099,The city has resources that the homeless need to access. In Las Vegas, I suppose they could go into the desert...  Private property has to meet code violations (they are sometimes sanctioned but rarely).
kakkln,gfbkqvo,,Homeless should declare a full out war
kakkln,gfdxuar,,Imagine if they instead spent that $60,000 on purchasing a tract of land that people could legally camp on.
kakkln,,gfq2gb5,*$16,000
kakkln,gff1p9q,,Oh gosh food not bombs so good-hearted so clever but so naive
kakkln,gff2khg,,This is infuriating. My hometown was razed to the ground by Hurricane Katrina. The rainbow family Caravan came to town and stayed for months helping people some of whom were squatting in their own destroyed homes or forming tent encampments along the Main Highway there serving meals all day first aid tents Etc and nobody complained a single bit did they? Nomads and displaced people coming together for survival was a heartwarming story but now it's like ... that would not fly these days just by changing the name of the kind of Crisis displaced unsheltered person might be experiencing at that time. This is the real natural disaster. Humanity
kakkln,gfce9cj,,This is infuriating
kakkln,gfcgt9a,,[this happened in LA too.  they think nobody remembers, but I fucking do. ](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-tiny-houses-seized-20160224-story.html).
kakkln,,gfdko64,I remember this. It was such a great idea. Wouldn‚Äôt you rather see this instead of a tent/tarp camp? These little houses gave the people a place to safely store things, charge their phone, and most importantly gave them dignity. They were easily moveable which made them perfect but then the fucking city tore them down.
kakkln,,gfg5v2k,Yeah I got there to record the crime against humanity on video but I was minutes too late.  It was on the ‚Äòghost block‚Äô (*neighborhood obliterated for freeway construction leaving just the road in place*) overpass over the 110 right where the toll lanes end, high 30‚Äôs or low 40‚Äôs.  I‚Äôve never seen LAPD get anything done so quickly before or since.  They said it was in response to ‚Äòneighborhood complaints‚Äô which is basically a euphemism for ‚Äú*the republicans that run USC demanded the smelly poors be removed so we bent over and obliged as usual*‚Äù.   It‚Äôs actually been ruled as unconstitutional so all those folks and especially the dude Elvis who built them is entitled to restitution for it under the homeless owned bulky item removal federal injunction currently in place.   Garcetti was mayor by then too wasn‚Äôt he..
kakkln,gfd3y8q,,Fuck them
kakkln,gfdkhnk,,Someone did the same thing in LA a few years ago except his were on wheels and therefore mobile to move for street cleaning. They tore them all town and sent it to the dump. So fucking sad.

ka412f,gf8yae0,,Hello
kaaanw,gf9c9o3,,Yeah. Also if you stay too long without getting a job and showing progress then you're "out of program" and they drop you entirely. Get a job and start saving as soon as you can because things are about to get way shittier this winter.
kaaanw,,gf9lbt0,"get a job" I'm disabled, stress causes me seizures. Your username says alot, by the way.
kaaanw,,gf9veq9,He's not trying to be your father. He is telling you how it works. You should stop getting so defensive and come up with the something because these guys are about to kick you out.
kaaanw,,gfasv9p,Oh I don't care what you do, I'm just telling you what they will do and what you need to do to survive. The disabled have jobs. Those too disabled to afford maintaining a good quality of life get assistance. Those who get seizures from stress get no sympathy. Welcome to the real world kid, it fucking sucks.
kaaanw,,gfauu78,Another dick comment from the king of apathy. 2020 wouldn't be complete without you.
kaaanw,,gfc9rag,Reality is cruel. Giving false hope is worse. King of Apathy should be capitalized.
kaaanw,,gfcqgtf,You are full of yourself, aren't you?

kaaanw,,gfd3z80,Thanks for playing!
kaaanw,,gfahxnp,Are you on disability? If so, maybe move to a more economical area where you can afford rent on disability income. Is not, apply asap and reach out to local charities like Catholic charities.
k8vw3r,gf20p0d,,When people say "all cops are bastards" they don't mean "every cop has the same personality" certainly some have the capacity for mercy. More like that their whole job is a bad thing that shouldn't exist because the job involves putting people in cages and approaches interpersonal harm in a punitive rather than preventative way. It's like, cops who are just doing their job will inevitably do something cruel because that's what the law tells them to do.
k8vw3r,,gj76ovo,Thank you! I get that slogans like ACAB are good for drawing attention to important problems because it's short and catchy for people with short attention spans, but they perpetuate some serious misconceptions when no-one bothers to explain them.
k8vw3r,gf0nshz,,ACAB
k8vw3r,,gf6e18c,most cops are awesome, select few are terrible and we need a better way to get rid of them(unions are really bad about just moving a cop to a new town instead of firing them)
k8vw3r,,gf6ey90,Strange that the only people really defending the cops on these posts are people that are obviously not homeless. A quick search through comment history and it makes me wonder how many of yalls have ever spent anything more than a weekend, living out of your car in your parents driveway, if that. If yalls wanna be simps to one of the most oppressive forces to the homeless community, go lurk in a cop reddit. Cops are literally the people that choose to  enforce the laws that make homelessness illegal.... But yeah, they're the good guys, just a couple bad apples.
k8vw3r,,gf6fnx6,I mean just because my comment history is what it is doesn't mean anything.  You don't know how I grew up where I lived as a child or not.  I might be at an amazing place in my life now but you don't know me or who helped my family(surprise here but it was the cops).  I am sick of grown adults acting like children and blaming everyone else for their problems.
k8vw3r,,gf6hst5,That last sentence explains it all. Real mask off moment.  Not quite sure the context or how it relates to this post, but if you are suggesting homeless people are like grown children blaming cops for their problems.... Again, I think ur in the wrong reddit.
k8vw3r,,gf0rf8h,[deleted]
k8vw3r,,gf0vz2u,I‚Äôd argue the exact opposite, that there‚Äôs more r/copaganda than documentation of abuse (only put the r/ so u can see what I‚Äôm talking about)
k8vw3r,,gf0xdia,OK, argue it then. Your link doesn't support your claim.
k8vw3r,,gf0s0p9,Ever heard of the blue wall of silence? The fact that "good" cops keep their mouths shut about "bad" cops makes them complicit and therefor also "bad" cops. Thinking you can tell a "good" one from a "bad" one is a bad outlook to have in my opinion. Best just assume they're all bastards
k8vw3r,,gf0tx40,Maybe it's just better to assume that all homeless people are violent drug addicts looking to rob you.  Police officers don't work for one big collective agency where they're all aware of wrongdoing of other officers.  There are thousands of agencies, most tiny.   Most individual officers work alone or with a partner and are responsible for their own shit and aren't in a position to stop some officer in another state from doing something illegal.
k8vw3r,,gf0wilu,Most homeless people don't walk around with a gun, authority, and immunity to the law. Homeless people also don't have a legal system supporting them from every angle or a fraternal brotherhood with multimillion dollar pockets. Bad analogy on ur part.  Where are all these simps coming from in r/homeless... Yalls ever lived on the streets? Lmao
k8vw3r,,gj7661y,The point is that just because Alice and Bob are both members of group X, you can't hold Alice accountable for what Bob does. Sure, it's less of a big deal for Bob to do shit when group X doesn't have systemic power because someone else will hold him accountable, but the moral judgment passed onto Alice should not be dependent on how much power group X holds.
k8vw3r,,gf33ca0,What an absolutely insane comparison. One is a job you can quit and the other is a situation that's incredibly hard to get out of
k8vw3r,,gj75sp5,Most people can't just quit their job without landing in said situation that's incredibly hard to get out of
k8vw3r,,gf3bbnr,Both are large diverse groups of individual human beings who deserve to be evaluated on what they've done, not what others have done.  When it comes to public service, good deeds and bad deeds both matter so much more, have so much more impact.
k8vw3r,,gf0shrs,hmmm....have you fought for women's rights in india? have you fought against the mistreatment of children in west africa? if not, then you're a bastard. You're human of this earth that's keeping your mouth shut when others are suffering.  Assuming you can tell a good cop from a bad cop based on appearance is obviously stupid, it takes much more to know a person. But just saying ACAB doesn't help anyone. It's a stupid ideology.
k8vw3r,,gf0tczc,Can I stand up for women in America? Or the mistreatment of children within the states? Or do those women and children not count? You have no idea what I do or how I spend my time... But feel free to go through my reddit history. If you're going to call my "ideology" stupid, at least provide some evidence for your argument. Saying not all cops are bad also doesn't help anyone, especially those of us in here who are constantly victimized by those same forces. BTW ACAB
k8vw3r,,gf0tvgg,What is an ACAB?
k8vw3r,,gf0uqj3,All Cops Are Bastards.
k8vw3r,,gf0tsqi,yes I am making the assumption that there exist human rights issues which you haven't fought for. It's infeasible for anyone to fight all. Say a man rapes you. Does that make all men bastards? no, it makes a all rapists bastards. if a cop harms you, it makes all bad cops bastards, not all cops.   Saying not all cops are bad absolutely helps people. If they're all bad, then why don't we abolish them? get rid of them all! By recognizing that all cops are not bastards, you can recognize that there are bad cops who need to be dealt with and good cops who need to be supported in doing their job, which is a very important one in theory at least.
k8vw3r,,gf0vm9z,Have you ever been homeless (actually) ? The perspective gives context.   "theory" I bet that's a popular word in your venacular
k8vw3r,,gf0v37w,The man who stands by and allows the rape is guilty as well. It doesn't mean all men are bastards, it means all men that allow rape are bastards.   & Yes, we should abolish the police. Replace them with well trained emergency therapists, community led and run citizens defense groups that could protect and patrol neighborhoods, divert funding towards housing the homeless, drug rehab that works, lowering poverty rates and overall reducing crime and the "need" for a police force.  If you understand the purpose of the police department, Acab makes alot more sense. Another Commenter goes into this in more detail.  Another important distinction is that I'm attacking a profession, not individuals. Many of those individuals happen to identify on a very personal level with that profession. They have too much power and too little accountability.  Edit:spelling
k8vw3r,,gf0ve8c,Yes but I am not allowing rape for simply being a man. You're assuming all cops are enabling or allowing bad cops, which isn't the case.   "citizens defense groups", how is this different than cops? also how would you get millionaires in malibu to patrol their streets?  a profession is a huge part of someones identity. The moment u attack a profession, u attack everyone who is that. It's a huge over generalization.
k8vw3r,,gf0vsaw,Get rid of those millionares and the system that enables produces them
k8vw3r,,gf0vx59,are you a socialist? not that I'm against that, just wondering if u are.
k8vw3r,,gf16j77,You're confused about what ACAB means. It doesn't mean every cop is a horrible human being, it means being a cop is a bad thing to be.
k8vw3r,ggzqm7r,,This tip from Daniel Suelo:  If a hitch-hiking or walking along the road and a police officer asks you what you are doing, answer  "I'm walking in America."  It makes them friendlier and breaks down barriers by associating you with the American ideal of liberty.
k8vw3r,gf2j3o1,,Ya man cops help me out more than the public honestly.
k8vw3r,gf1j9qs,,Yeah that were dumb enough to become cops
k8vw3r,gf35bl6,,This is very good and reassuring to read. I think it's easy to lose sight on the humanity of others when you are as vulnerable as a person sleeping on the streets... I know when I was going through it I was often very hateful and angry in general at police and security just because I was largely within the demographic of people they are forced to deal with. Most don't want or have the energy to apply a more individualistic approach to an encounter outside the uniform "Move along pal" so hearing that there are actually some people who can reflect and see that just because they are in that position of being tasked to asking people do to something because other people are afraid to do it themselves, it largely comforting.      I often find myself dreaming of becoming a police officer just so I can rewrite all those past encounters I had. Maybe I can make that path a little bit lighter and easier for others new to it or unable to adapt in a more low key way. Thanks for sharing and I am glad you were able to share the encounter with the rest of us! God bless you and that cop!
k8023c,gevzyrm,,Before I read the coment below, I thought that's an awesome idea for homeless in Toronto, and ther see through so if your doing crazy shit in there, it's easy to see what's up.   Toronto homeless die every winter because of the cold conditions. That's exactly where I spent my time homeless. People need to wake up.
k8023c,gexavds,,This is so bizarre.

k8023c,gevulgh,,Greenhouse effect in that must be brutal and don't fart cause your stuck with it lol

k8023c,gey5t4e,,This after Tory signed an ordinance to [start encampment eviction processes](https://www.blogto.com/city/2020/12/hundreds-sign-open-letters-urging-toronto-stop-encampment-evictions/) citing an impending winter and shelter capacity increases (nothing meaningful) while simultaneously handing out eviction notices and [cease and desists to a local carpenter](https://www.blogto.com/city/2020/11/man-building-homeless-shelters-threatened-legal-action-toronto/) making tiny shelters to keep people alive because he didn't want them on public land.  It's easy to be ashamed of Toronto and it's lackluster leadership.  ^(\*BlogTO sources were just easiest to find, they're not ideal nor the pinnacle of local journalism and the comments are toxic as hell, please don't bother with them.)  But hey, there's yoga at least /s
k8023c,geyls8d,,There needs to be a way that the homeless can create value for others.  Society doesn't seem to care about giving them work they can do, for 2-4 hours a day.  Right now, it's set up that you basically have to work 4-8 hours a day, look a certain way, have a certain type of address, etc.
k8023c,gezbm0d,,$
k89ge2,gewu7nn,,Many people don't want to deal with the potential downsides of trespassing.  Depending on how hard the police want to be, they can stack up charges once you've broken into an area you technically shouldn't be in.  Then there is the fact that you are within an enclose space, should a more unsavory type of person decide to confront you.  There's a post in this sub from a guy who woke up to someone trying to take the backpack off his back, while he was in his own tent... so someone deciding to kick the shit out of you while you are squatting and no one can witness the event because you are hidden from the public by being in an abandoned building in a relatively empty part of town... that isn't outside the realm of possibility.  What makes people want to live in tents in city parks, is generally both trying to be as close to available services as possible, and the whole "safety in numbers" thing.  That sense of community people seek out.
k89ge2,,gewuw25,I dont "break in". It's not a B&E unless there are signs of forced entry. Trespassing is only a misdemeanor. I'll take a misdemeanor over freezing all night and smelling like B.O. anytime.  As far as numbers go, I don't do this alone. I can't stand being alone lol. I have a few people that follow me from spot to spot.
k89ge2,,gewx6f9,I think you're coming from a good place but just aren't aware of some of the complicated issues homeless people face.
k89ge2,,gfj4k7r,> It's not a B&E unless there are signs of forced entry.   I'm not sure where you are at, but I did want to clarify: this is not true everywhere. I worked for 911 for a long time and I know of multiple people that were charged with B&E despite no forced entry.
k89ge2,,gfjjc2h,Youre probably right. Honestly, i might just be totally delusional and have convinced myself of something that i only wish were true. Im not the only one thats living out this fever dream though, and so far so good. Its been working out for quite a while now.
k89ge2,,gezdpke,What it sounds like you need to do, is write a book instructing people in how you squat, what you believe is important to do when you squat, and essential materials and tools to be able to squat safely.  You definitely want to talk about your view on squatting, that's for sure.
k89ge2,,gewv2hj,Also, i carry a deadbolt and keys with me from spot to spot. I keep it secured.
k89ge2,,geyeete,This additional information kind of turns your question from "Why don't people squat?" into "Why don't people do what I do?"
k89ge2,,gf558gb,Yes. Ive been exposed. Im a shill for the deadbolt industries and the whole squatting angle is just a way to sell more of them.
k89ge2,,gf93vrd,Exaggeration doesn't help your case.  You know.... taking what I'm talking about, blowing it out of proportion, and then only addressing your exaggeration instead of what I actually talked about.  This is called a Straw Man argument.  See, I said nothing about you attempting to get people to purchase deadbolts... you just mentioned them twice without any prompting at all.  They were on your mind, and you wanted to make sure people knew you used them and what for.  But when I pointed this out, you decided to argue against how I'm saying you are some kind of lobbyist for the Deadbolt industry... and I said nothing like that at all.  And what I'm talking about is how you asked a question, to appear as if you were looking for information, when you had an agenda to "sell" the idea of squatting to anyone who posted answers for you.  I get it.  You believe more people should squat, and you'd like to talk more people into squatting because it has proven to be a useful pastime for you.  I am just convinced that your approach was a rather manipulative one.  Your choice of using the Straw Man argument in your response just proves to me that you were being consciously manipulative.
k89ge2,,gfcgcf0,Omg i get it, i get it. You dont like me or my ideas very much. That's fine. I understand that not everyone is cut out for it, or that some people worry about tarnishing their criminal records. Sometimes i lose sight of the fact that not everyone is a multiple felon. Or that not everyone is quite on board with anarchism yet. Who knows, maybe its all the speed? Idk. In my mind it just makes sense that if im cold, i should do something about it. Not everyone wants a squat but I'll keep cracking them and setting them up for the people who do but might not know how
k89ge2,,gfcowlf,Obviously you don't get it.  You want to tell people about the joys of squatting.  You want to pass on your knowledge of squatting, and what you've learned to avoid pitfalls.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to pass on information.  As I already suggested, maybe you should write a book or How-To manual.  You can treat that suggestion as a joke or something not serious, but that is your mistake... not mine.  I'll try to explain it one more time.  I have a problem with your METHODS.  I have a problem with the misleading techniques you use to try to draw people into the conversation you REALLY want to have.  I have a problem with how you revert to narcissistic ways of responding to people who are saying things you don't like to hear (that Straw Man argument bullshit that came out of you, for example).  I have a problem with manipulative people who say one thing, but mean another (like, asking a question, but not actually being interested in the answers... since you just want an audience to listen to what you have to say).  I don't know you, other than what I know of how you seem to like to do things.  I don't like what you've done in this thread, and I've pointed out what I don't like and why I don't like it.  And again, you pull out the Straw Man argument to redirect the conversation... being manipulative.  Quote where I said that I don't like you.  Quote where I said that I don't like your ideas.  I said NEITHER.    I never said anything at all about not liking your deadbolt idea.  What I did NOT like, was how you launched into bringing deadbolts into the conversation because that is what YOU wanted to talk about.  Not because I asked you ANYTHING about what you do when you squat.  I didn't ask what you to do secure yourself.  I didn't ask what techniques you use.  I didn't actually ask you anything.  I simply answered the question YOU asked.  YOU brought up what YOU wanted to actually talk about without any prompting from me.  It was like you and I were having two completely different conversations... like if I had responded to your post with just "do do do do do do do la la", you still would have said exactly the same things you said.  You understand that not everyone is cut out for squatting.  I understand that not everyone is cut out for honest communication.  You are trying to convince me that your take on squatting is the way to go, and I'm trying to convince you that you are being a very manipulative and dodgy person in the way you are operating.  You aren't having any luck with me, and I know I'm not having any luck with you.  And for the record, I'm squatting right now.  I live alone in a trailer I don't own or rent.  I am on land I don't own or rent.  Neither I, nor the person who does "Own" the trailer (no bill of sale or title though) owns the land we are on.  I live in a community of people who are squatting on government owned land.
k89ge2,,gfe8z6h,Slab city fucking sucks anyway. Ive been through  there. If fucking off with old people in a desert trailerpark is the only right way to squat then i give up all together. You win. I hope your happy
k89ge2,,gfffvbl,Again... the level of dishonesty that comes out of you is almost staggering.  You'll do anything to avoid an honest conversation that involves reason and logic.  Things have to either be your way... or you just turn to insults and false statements.  That's sad.
k89ge2,,gjpqk8a,I would love to have you come over and call out my cluster B boyfriend. (Not that he would listen)
k89ge2,,gjsa5e0,I have faith that if you learn to spot the tricks... the straw man arguments, the redirections, the misdirection attempts, the projection, the gaslighting, etc... you too can calmly call him out.  Understand though.. you've got to be willing to let the harmful and toxic things he WILL say to maintain control of the conversation, just slide to the side as you refuse to LET him control the conversation.  That's the trick.  And it isn't easy, when you have been intimately involved with someone, because they know just how to push your buttons to make you defensive, turning the conversation away from what they don't want to talk about.  But you are correct. He wouldn't listen.  They don't listen.  That's why in the end, you generally have to establish a policy of No Contact.  Kind of like, accepting the fact that you won't "win" the argument, and choosing NEVER to argue again.  The only way to win is not to play.
k89ge2,,glillih,‚ÄúThe only way to win is to not play.‚Äù TRUTH!
k89ge2,,gewytac,Im aware of the complications. Im homeless
k89ge2,,geye0qg,You asked why people don't squat.  I answered the question.  If you already knew the answers, why ask the question?
k89ge2,,gf1mnik,Pretty much. I mean, i take a shower (sometimes even more than one) everyday, have a locked door, and it costs me nothing. So yea, why do people try so hard to follow a rule of law of a system that inherently holds them under a thumb?   "Why yessir, ill be sure to pitch my tent in the specific area designated. That way the more fortunate class can gawk at me like a zoo animal, while i live a miserable existence".  No thanks
k89ge2,,gf47aij,So, it bothers you when the More Fortunate can observe you.. it bothers you knowing that people who have more than you are looking at you and judging you.  Interesting.  How long have you had this issue with your self-image?  How long have you been preoccupied with what other people think of you?
k89ge2,,gf1livf,Dude, you ever heard of a deadbolt?
k89ge2,,gf2k29m,That is twice now that you've tried to interject deadbolts into the discussion.  I thought you were asking why people don't squat, not looking for a platform to promote what you think should be done and how it should be done.
k89ge2,,gf2rl3x,Im not promoting anything other than people getting out of the cold. Whats your problem smartass old man?
k89ge2,,gf470gp,You didn't mention deadbolts this time.  Why pass up the opportunity?  > Im not promoting anything other than people getting out of the cold.  That's a blatant lie.  You are... promoting deadbolts.  That's for sure.  You are promoting squatting in groups.  You are promoting make sure you leave no external evidence of breaking and entering because you believe that eliminates the possibility of being charged with a B&E.  I mean, I can quote you left and right... but I get the feeling you are the kind of person to ignore your own words.  Time will tell.  But the worst part?  You shouldn't even be promoting people getting out of the cold.  You came here under the guise of seeking information, when in point of fact you were only attempting to promote your own agenda (and yes, trying to get people to squat somewhere to get out of the cold is an agenda whether or not you like the classification).  What's my problem?  Dishonesty... yours specifically.
k89ge2,geyihqd,,No one should give this loser the time of day. His advice will land you in jail, catch you a beating, or potentially get you killed.   If you do end up with a serious criminal record, it can make getting yourself out of homelessness much harder. Laws relating to breaking and entering vary by country and state. Hes also advocating fraud and a bunch of other crimes that come with heavy penalties.  Edit: while there is merit to taking risks to avoid, say, freezing to death.  The solution hes advocating is much riskier than he is suggesting and there are often much better alternatives. Yeah, maybe he hasn't been caught yet so he thinks it is fine, but when hes spending 5 years in jail he might offer different advice.  Edit 2: I just want to add that when the public complains about the homeless and refuses to help, and when your bag gets stolen at a shelter, etc.. this type of guy is the reason. Doesnt care about anyone but himself. Supports himself through crime. To me, his type is the biggest barrier to getting the public inside with better solutions to homelessness. Despicable.
k89ge2,,gf1lqai,Who cares what the public thinks? If its a choice between living like a refugee or some people maybe not liking me, i say screw em. Im not going to live like a victim.
k89ge2,,gf1tgod,Go read through this forum and you see a bunch of complaints:  "Why does the public hate homeless?" "Why don't they fund things more?" "Why do they treat me like a criminal?"  You are the reason.  Assholes like you ruin things for everyone else.  If it wasn't for parasites like you a lot less people would be homeless. Why should you care? Because you're not just causing problems for rich people, but fellow homeless. You can't see the bigger picture don't understand consequences. You have no empathy for others.  Fuck yourself.
k89ge2,,gfjuzww,Maybe so... Imma keep at it though. Think the public hates us now? Just wait and see. I keep raising the bar on a daily basis, and  I'm doing my part to make Seattle shitty again. Watch this property value plummet, you old cocksucker
k89ge2,,gfct1gj,>"Why yessir, ill be sure to pitch my tent in the specific area designated. That way the more fortunate class can gawk at me like a zoo animal, while i live a miserable existence".   >   >No thanks  Who cares what the public thinks?  Obviously, YOU CARE!  Those words I quoted are your words.  Your words, where you say that you care deeply about what other people think about you, to the point where you don't want to even be VISIBLE for people to be able to think anything about you.  You really need to keep track of what comes out of your mouth.  Just like I said two days ago, you seem like the kind of person who refuses to take responsibility for what they say.
k89ge2,,gfdf44g,No i dont care what anyone thinks. I just dont enjoy being gawked at by yuppies which is what i experienced living in a park. I also care about ntaking regular showers so that i dont smell like shit all day and i also care about being warm and having a place with thicker walls than a tent to secure my shit.   Another thing, i dont need or have to do anything at all that i dont feel like doing. Especially explaining myself to an old homebum. The only reason i have entertained your bullshit is because im at my squat, lying in my bed, high as hell, and have already sold enough shit to call it a day
k89ge2,,gffxgtg,> No i dont care what anyone thinks. I just dont enjoy being gawked at by yuppies which is what i experienced living in a park.  You are contradicting yourself here, but you'll never admit it.  If you don't care what anyone thinks, it wouldn't matter to you if you were being gawked at by yuppies.  But being gawked at by yuppies was something you did not enjoy, thus you cared about being gawked at.  If you didn't care about it, it wouldn't affect your enjoyment.  > I also care about ntaking regular showers so that i dont smell like shit all day  So... all that means is you camp in a public space near one of the places that offers free showers and free laundry.  No squatting necessary.  > Another thing, i dont need or have to do anything at all that i dont feel like doing. Especially explaining myself to an old homebum.  Again, more dishonesty, but with added bluster... because you are HERE on the internet of strangers, looking to explain yourself and what you like to do and why other people should do it. So... you do seem to like to contradict yourself.
k89ge2,,gf1lyqf,5 years in jail for trespassing??? This is hilarious. You have so much fear in you.  Again, i lock my doors. I had way more stuff stolen when i lived in a tent than i do now. And ive got way more stuff. I dont trash the property or leave dirty needles everywhere. I cant say the same for the people i know living in the park. That shit is disgusting.
k89ge2,,gf3d4p6,Not trespassing.   Breaking and Entering. Theft.  Fraud. Mischief.  Possession of Break-in Tools. Uttering a forged document.  Do you even understand what laws you're breaking?
k89ge2,gf08xwd,,I‚Äôve had varying luck depending on city. No luck yet in mine but looking for demolition permits is a good idea.  This exists https://www.sproutdistro.com/catalog/zines/direct-action/its-vacant-take-it
k89ge2,,gf1mdfl,Nice! Yea i work closely with local anarchists, antifa, ect. I also teach anybody willing to learn how to crack their own squats. Including how to turn on utilities and secure their spot
k89ge2,gf7hkx8,,My worth was $0.02 is that every time I've ever done anything close to squatting I just didn't get away with it for long. Maybe I'm not cut out for that lifestyle. Maybe some other people are. Shrug. I want the direction of doing things differently and as a result I don't get into any trouble really anymore
k89ge2,,gfcfjnz,That's definitely valid. Squatting is somewhat stressful at times. Especially the transitions from it being time to leave one spot and also needing to find another. There is a lot of uncertainty. I guess maybe im just lucky that i find a way to make it work.
k89ge2,gfde9kb,,Wrong. How would i know as a tenant that its abandoned? People rent slum shithole places all the time. I could never afford an upscale place to rent anyway. If i have the owners name(which can be acquired easily by looking up the parcel's information) and say that so and so rented the place to me on month to month basis, utilities included, then how can anyone prove otherwise? If the owner denies it, then its my word against theirs. In that case, favor always goes to the tenant
k89ge2,gewzp1o,,And before anyone mentions it: yes, i do live a criminal lifestyle, and yes my squats are full of violent drug addicts and prostitutes. That doesnt mean that yours also has to be. Thats just the circumstances that i find myself in and these people are my friends.

k75du5,geov0e8,,"53% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck" ......and that was before the pandemic. It says 35% have nothing saved. I can only speculate but I know a lot of Americans have been living on savings this past year so that 35% is likely to be much higher now. That's a really personal question for someone to ask you!

k75du5,gep5dr4,,This is one of the things that kills me about this society. It seems perfectly OK for someone to have a huge house, a couple of fancy cars, kids in college and a fat bank account, BUT be hundreds of thousands in DEBT. The current president, for example - is supposed to OWE people something like $400 million. But those same people look down on and despise a homeless guy living on the streets with $5 in his pocket and NO DEBT. It should be the other way around. Fucking nuts.
k75du5,,gepd0oo,It's called classism. Teach the lower classes to point the finger of blame at eachother so that the most wealthy or privileged can collect all the wealth for themselves.   Did you know that trump and one of his immediate family recieved over 3million dollars from the stimulus package passed earlier this year? The funds were intended for small businesses. They both benefited from it. While some still havent recieved their stimulus.   Millionaire YouTuber Jake paul also recieved over 30k in funds for small businesses. In fact, many millionaires benefitted from the stimulus package. People who didnt need it.   Multi millionaire Jefree star, a popular YouTuber and makeup mogul (he has a brand that sells his own makeup products/cosmetics). Was able to upsize from his already huge mansion, to an even bigger one, early this summer..at the early start of the pandemic as people were beginning to lose work. He also recieved money from the stimulus package. He has like 3 or 4 cars including a Tesla and if I'm not mistaken a lamby or two. You got breadcrumbs.    It goes on and on..it will continue to go on until people stand up to it. The poor have to stand up to it. And yet..they are among some of the most effected by this crisis and dont have time or energy to fight it. Pretty soon though..it may be the only option we have left
k75du5,,gep6s3j,And yet those people who are in debt with their homes have access to things like a kitchen. So they go grocery shopping and can buy food that homeless people don't usually have access to. Like raw chicken, it's cheaper than just going to McDonald's and buying a chicken sandwich. People don't understand how much money it costs to actually be homeless. And the system is designed to keep it that way.
k75du5,,gept88p,Yep. When living outdoors you buy smaller, more expensive portions. The poorer you are the more expensive food is.  Upside down 'Economy'.
k75du5,,gepysb9,True. I never realized how freaking expensive being homeless was until I was homeless myself. It's so hard to pull up out of that when literally ALL the money was going to survival.
k75du5,,gepsgls,Because wealthy people know how to cheat, lie and steal their way to riches. They aren't sorry about that either. Nor do they care about poor people. Often times Stepping on poor people is how they climbed the ladder to wealth. Trumps dad was a slumlord. Imagine that lesson learned.  Honest people are the ones getting the shaft.
k75du5,,geptk4r,Truth. You can be litterly get away with anything if you have the money and resources to do so. üí∞
k75du5,,gepuao8,> The current president, for example - is supposed to OWE people something like $400 million.  "Individual 1" still has a positive net worth due to high assets. Forbes estimates his net worth at around $2.5 billion, because they don't think his name is worth anything (he claims $9 to $10 billion because he thinks his name is worth a lot more than it really s). I doubt he has a lot of liquid cash though. He would have to remortgage property to pay off $400 million, or more likely just *not* pay (we don't know his credit rating, but it's probably terrible, as he has a history of not paying for work done).

k75du5,,gfsxsrh,What's crazy is that being middle class used to be a breeze. Now, in many areas, even being upper middle class/lower upper class live as the lower middle class did decades ago.   The upper upper class are shooting up while everyone else is being pulled down and the middle and lower class are being pitted against one another.  My family member was offered a much better paid position in another part of the state making 100k. Turned out, the area is much more expensive and he is STRUGGLING on that amount. After much higher taxes, rent, utilities, car, health insurance, etc. he only has a couple hundred left over for food every month. He has a small place and an old car.   No one should be making 6 figures and struggling. Wtf.

k75du5,gepty9h,,> Do people who live a normal non-homeless actually have money put back like that?  Some do. There's a whole movement around this, called FIRE. There are many older people who gift their adult children with money for a down payment on their own home. Where I live, people need three times the average salary to buy a house, but many do anyway. Either they're rich, or they're getting an "early" inheritance. Clearly their parents were able to save up money. Some married couples simply don't have kids, which is a great way to save money.  Many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and couldn't bring up $1,000 if they suffered from an emergency. However, many people *can*. It's not just about income. Some people live cheaply, either because they live with family or roommates, or because they live in a low cost of living place. (Such places tend to have low income, but not always, or even if the average income is lower, the lower cost of living might more than make up for it. I spoke to someone my age, single, slightly lower income, who has a house. I'm not jealous, it's just that he's willing to live in a place I'm not.)
k75du5,gepj9vl,,A lot of people do, and a lot of people don't.     It depends on a lot of factors, probably the two biggest being whether someone's parents/caregivers made a point to instill the importance of saving money and then also the social/economical ability to actually begin saving.     If you look at the pay-day loan/car title loan industry you'll see that there are plenty of us out there that have no savings to fall back on.
k75du5,,geprg4l,I always say the absolute biggest leg up your parents can give you is instilling financial literacy. It‚Äôs why so many people win the lottery & go broke in a few years. When I made $50k a year I saved like a fiend, but my best friend who made $85k lived paycheck to paycheck
k75du5,,gepumht,I agree. Having said that...  My mother taught me nothing of value when it comes to finances. I had to learn from the internet, and made some mistakes before I got serious about it. Today I have to teach *her* financial things.
k75du5,gepyrkg,,This reminds me of a time when I was explaining to a guy that I didn't have the money for something. He was like: just dip in to your savings. I told him I didn't have any. He freaked out and told me that was irresponsible and I needed to start saving. Cool idea. Let me just start not using all that extra money I get all the time.
k75du5,gepo2z3,,I live on $820 a month. I get food stamps and have a housing subsidy. If I didnt have the housing subsidy I would be homeless.
k75du5,,geps2dx,I live on 840 a month plus food stamps, no housing subsidy. They take 150 out of my disability for health insurance. So I have 600 or so to live on per month. It's doable but not pretty
k75du5,,geupi8v,Hugs.
k75du5,,gf93389,Sheet, in the late 90's, I used to live off $514/month. And my rent was $365. No section 8 or anything. I received a small amount of food stamps...less than $25 a month. Yet, I survived. Being a minimalist was key and forget about a social life. Have to find cheap entertainment. Did not have/Internet back then. The library, parks and dollar stores are your friends.
k75du5,gepr557,, Not homeless, I just lurk on this sub for a different perspective. Since age 20 I always kept at least $5k in savings bc I was always prepared for the worst. I always put 60% of my pay into savings bc w/ bipolar disorder I knew I could lose my job at any time.   In January of this year I had $25k in the bank & that got me through my Covid layoff. But despite all that I knew I was incredibly lucky to have that, & not everyone does. Anyone who acts like they don‚Äôt understand not having enough money isn‚Äôt stupid, they‚Äôre just being a dick.
k75du5,gepdg6b,,Rich people born on 3rd base like to think it‚Äôs easy to score the home run is all that is  don't even try with that type it will never get better, they are willfully ignorant because they don‚Äôt want to feel bad
k75du5,gept44s,,How old are you? You look young that's why I'm asking. But when I was on the streets I certainly didn't have savings and now that I am 31 and somewhat stable, I have SOME savings. And my savings is probably pennies to somebody else
k75du5,geq44zv,,‚ÄúNormal non-homeless person‚Äù here.  It‚Äôs not strange, at all. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs quite common.  Some people have savings. Many people don‚Äôt, and there are many reasons why they don‚Äôt. Not necessarily because they‚Äôre financially irresponsible. Most people simply don‚Äôt make enough money to save, and are living check to check.  There have been plenty of times throughout my life that I didn‚Äôt have any savings at all, and times when I managed to save and maintain a small amount of savings, for emergencies. I have chronic health issues, so medical bills typically affect what I can keep in savings, or if I can save anything at all.  Just do what you can do with the resources you have, and avoid getting into debt! It‚Äôs better to be down to your last dollar and not owe anyone, than it is to be in debt and have your next few dollars set to go into someone else‚Äôs pocket, before you even get them!
k75du5,geq693p,,That's dumb on so many levels. The assumption there being homeless people have money but are for whatever reason unwilling to spend it, which could happen in choice cases here and there, but to honestly believe all of America's homeless have cash they just aren't willing to part with shows just how little they actually thought before they spoke.  But here's the other thing - no one cares about your savings. I could go to a rental management company and show them that I have $50,000 is savings. I still wouldn't be able to get an apartment without showing proof of *income.* Most places want to see that you earn 3 or 3.5 times the rent every month. Sometimes they ask for bank statements, but many don't. Every single one of them will want your tax return and/or last three pay stubs. Maybe you could find something on Craigslist or a long-term air b&b, but you're not getting a new rental or a mortgage on savings alone.
k75du5,,geuwjrc,If you‚Äôre able to find a guarantor then that changes things. I got laid off in March, am on unemployment, needed to move in September. I showed that I had $15k in savings but they didn‚Äôt count unemployment as income, so I had to also show my parents bank statements & have them sign my lease as a guarantor/backup if I fail to pay.   If you don‚Äôt have your own co-signer/guarantor there are companies you can pay to act as that for you. There‚Äôs always an option if you have a little cash.
k75du5,geq7fq6,,I have savings, it's where I would deposit my checks from collecting cans but what I have in savings is not enough for a security deposit and first months rent let alone renting for a few months. It's enough so that if I need a hotel room for two to three nights, I have that option but that's a last resort because there's always emergencies coming up so I pick and choose which emergency I can take care of.
k75du5,geq8erc,,It's really common in my opinion for people to have a lot of debt thanks to things like credit cards and home equity lines of credit (also known as second mortgages) on their residence.  If anything goes wrong and they can't make the payments on those debts, it gets extremely scary.  One woman I know is employed at a $50,000 a year job (or she was) and she had a credit card with a $25,000 limit!  In theory, she could go out tomorrow and charge $25,000 on her card - if she does this and then an emergency hits and she loses her job, she's royally screwed.  I've borrowed against the equity in my primary residence to purchase rental properties (an asset) and so far I have tenants that are paying rent.  If worse comes to worse, I could sell the properties and pay off the debt but right now is the absolute worse time to sell, I would have to sell at a loss.  It's the people who borrow against their future earnings or their home equity to pay for their lives (a liability) that are going to get really shafted.  Like having to declare bankruptcy and start over.  I also think our society is so consumer driven.  It's like it will collapse if you don't go out and buy the latest fashion, the hottest car, the biggest mansion on the block.....yah, right.....I notice all those premium things have premium prices.  No thanks!  Savings are important but it has to be reasonable so that people do it.  When all you can afford to save is $1 a week, it's not really worth it because bank fees will eat it up.  Solutions??????  Who knows.  Smarter people than me have tried and for whatever reason, failed to come up with a solution.
k75du5,geqptkh,,I'm an elder millenial who hasn't had a 401k (or an employer match) since 2008 and only about 5% of my friends aren't in severe medical or educational debt.  Anyone who still believes capitalism enables people to save has probably never done an actual day's worth of work in the whole of their bizarre privileged lives.

k75du5,,geqwu50,The way to achieve this is putting that same amount in the bank everyweek, you get compounding interest and just make sure your money has a decent interest rate and put your head down your ass up and grind for a few years you‚Äôll shit yourself how fast you have much more money to use for emergencies, fun, bank loans etc etc etc. it‚Äôs a necessary evil, the real evil are the lazy people convincing themselves money is for snobs and people who want Ferrari‚Äôs when the realism of it is the more money you have the more you can do with your life in today‚Äôs society.
k75du5,,geqx65g,100 was all I could afford to put away for the entire year , that year. It was a challenge I agreed to with a friend.

k5h8m7,geeur6t,,As someone who's been off and on homeless literally on the streets, and now doing van life, and spending time in shelters and missions mens programs what it really comes down to is money. Sure you're gonna have drug addicts who will just abuse the heck out a free housing situation to the point of killing themselves or lazy people, the mentally ill but that represents maybe around 25-30 percent of the total homeless population. The rest are essentially older males who are unskilled--and have found themselves in a trap of not being able to save for deposit and first or has a felony for traditional housing which has been a barrier for them to get better skills. It's really tough to pull yourself out of this trap when you're earning about 50 bucks a day after taxes at a low skilled job. A nice robust jobs program that provide dorm style housing like Job corps but for adults would be one solution which would alleviate a huge chunk of the trapped, able-bodied homeless males. Fort Lyon, Colorado is the only programs i've managed to track down in the entire country with this. You commit to living in old hospital and the state will pay for you to attend a local community college to learn a trade. It's free  [https://www.coloradocoalition.org/fortlyon](https://www.coloradocoalition.org/fortlyon)

k5h8m7,,gefuo4a,Yeah it does!
k5h8m7,,gegp3cs,> Sure you're gonna have drug addicts who will just abuse the heck out a free housing situation to the point of killing themselves  The problem is less that they're freeloading while getting high - it's that they make it unlivable for those around them. As a result, it's almost impossible to put together a decent housing program that isn't also a bit like living in a prison with all sorts of rules.  > The rest are essentially older males who are unskilled  It's not so much that they're unskilled as no one wants to hire them even *if* they have skills because everyone wants to hire younger workers.  Felonies are an issue. Sexual predator lists are another big issue - even when their offense is something as benign as 'took a leak on the side of a building'. Child support arrears make you effectively unemployable as well.
k5h8m7,,i0t6jer,The lists aren't really the issue, it's the non-offensive offenses (like pissing in an alley) being considered sex crimes
k5h8m7,gef0w8m,,True however many people will just say "They should have made better decisions and this wouldn't have happened to them".

k5h8m7,,gefamdt,I agree, but unfortunately many Americans don't have empathy for the less fortunate.  In some ways I can't blame them for thinking this way, since Americans in general undergo a type of psychological conditioning from an early age that teaches us to venerate success and have nothing but contempt and disdain for perceived failure.

k5h8m7,geeuq3b,,None of those things should cause homelessness though. It's entirely possible to house people even if they're addicts, or sick, or poor, or going through a major life change.   We are encouraged to blame these other things for homelessness so we don't talk about why it's bad to commodity necessities like shelter.
k5h8m7,,gef1wdc,I made my living for a few years going through dumpsters for aluminum cans. Apartment complexes where some of the best. The homeless do not drink, or generally do drugs, at even a tiny fraction of these homed people. I regularly fished out over $40 buck worth of beer cans in the dumpster at a single apartment complex.   The only real trick is knowing how not to get trespassed. There was one apartment complex where I could do significantly better than $40 bucks. The manager seen me one day and I got trespassed. I responded by saying saying "sure," just give me a few minutes to make sure I didn't leave any messes behind. I was untrespassed before I got off the property.
k5h8m7,,gef2tsg,I wish my state ( Kentucky ) had a bottle bill . I pick up litter and find tons of cans and bottles but can just recycle them and not get money for deposit . I do find money pretty regularly picking up litter , like 1 , 5 and even 20 dollar bills occasionally . Sometimes even lottery tickets that people threw on the ground that were winners - not big winners but 5 or 10 dollars . You are respectful with collecting cans and bottles and not leaving a mess , so I hope you don't get hassled too much .
k5h8m7,,gef6rp6,As much as I wish bottles were worth it they just weren't, so I never bothered with it. Being barely fit to walk empty handed and having to carry everything meant that even if a local place took bottles at the national average, which they didn't, 1/5th of the price by weight simply wasn't worth it. With a way to haul bottles in bulk I know exactly where to get tons of them.
k5h8m7,,gef3mtq,People like to forget that the homeless population is primarily made up of people in extreme poverty. Hard to support any significant drinking or drug habits with no money.
k5h8m7,,geev9dw,what kind of model do you envision?
k5h8m7,,geevzyz,The Finnish model would be good to see, over there homeless people get permanent housing as soon as they become homeless. They're on their way to eradicating homelessness
k5h8m7,,gef114f,Utah did that as well.
k5h8m7,,geewf0p,Public housing for everyone, not just the homeless and poor. Or at least take profit out of housing.
k5h8m7,,gefnshe,You want to take away the homes of millions of people and force them to live in tenements?  Good luck with that.  Sounds like a totalitarian dystopia to me.  How about just a UBI so everybody can afford their basic needs including housing.
k5h8m7,,gefrdy6,Nobody is getting kicked out of their homes. I don't even know how you got that out of what they said. We are talking about eliminating landlords and rent. Nobody should be allowed to privately own housing and then force people to pay up or be homeless.  People can keep living where they are living and we can just fill up the empty housing with people.
k5h8m7,,gefzusi,You don't know how I got that from "public housing for everyone, not just the homeless and poor"? ...really?
k5h8m7,,geg5xw1,Did I say we should switch to that overnight and that everyone who currently owns a home should lose it? Do you know "public housing" can include any kind of housing people want? Even single family homes.   I really wonder about people that cannot even imagine any other possible way for humans to provide shelter for each other.
k5h8m7,,gegjxak,Public housing is by definition owned by the government.  So yes, you strongly implied that everyone who owns a home should lose that.  I don't think we need to overcomplicate the problem of homelessness by insisting that we tear down society to fix it.  We simply need to provide a UBI so that everyone can afford housing.
k5h8m7,,gegpo1l,You've never heard of co-ops?   I didn't imply anything. I don't even understand why my opinion upsets you so much. Nothing will ever change. Capitalism is going to drive the human race into extinction. I just like to fantasize about humanity figuring out how to share.
k5h8m7,,geh9fgu,I haven't expressed being upset, just that I disagree. I also disagree with your pessimism. Things do change all the time. I was once a homeless drunk. And capitalism has reduced the global poverty rate by 90% since its inception. It's a powerful tool for generating wealth. Now we have the ability to eliminate poverty by doing one simple thing: giving people money.  UBI could end homelessness overnight.  It would also grow the economy by trillions.
k5h8m7,,gwpcyc8,I like this. ( I work 28-40 hours a week as a security guard, and would still work if I got UBI. ) contrary to GOP/Fox News propaganda, not many of us lower income people are actually lazy!
k5h8m7,geg2toa,,Because at the end of the day, the powers that be believe we can pull our self oit of the pit with minimal assistance. But what they don't know is once you're there, how hard it is to leave.
k5h8m7,gef5zhm,,So true .
k5h8m7,gegf5q5,,These are the first leading causes of depression, and suicides.  And when individuals experiences one or more of these situations, a hand up is what is needed, not a hand out.
k5h8m7,,gei7tp7,Exactly!!! A hand up would've made things so much better for me but people judged, ridiculed and turned their backs on me when I really really needed them. It's taken a toll on my mental, physical and emotional health.
k5h8m7,geh3s9p,,How come *drug addiction* get the nice tent...? motherfuckers...   and gawddamn *income inequality* got his legs sticking out... somebody help that guy
k5h8m7,gewqysr,,Thanks
k5h8m7,gef8uhw,,It‚Äôs mostly drug addiction. And mental illness that come from it is made worse by drug addiction.  At least in Los Angeles.  A few of these are wrong like income inequality or student debt. Neither contribute to homelessness
k5h8m7,,geggces,Do you know what income inequality is? How can you say poverty doesn't contribute to homelessness?
k5h8m7,,gefg3p8,Okay then. I didn't know you were the authority on the subject.
k5h8m7,ggfm855,,Sounds like we should build some sort of support for the homeless. One for the mental mind. Second is for finance. Third is just for life. Literally just give them the ability for options and life coaches. I think we can all support.
k5h8m7,hv6km3g,,I'm raising $5,000.00 until 03/03/2022 for Help with a new used car !. Can you help? https://paypal.com/pools/c/8GTPL0UXqf anything helps üö®!

k4nvqe,gekgd5c,,The homeless need advocates. Talk to them, get to know their struggles. Speak for them.
k43t6q,ge6jeal,,I made this petition to bring attention to an issue that may be overlooked about financially helping homeless people. We are growing increasingly dependent on technology and cashless payments which directly impacts our ability to provide monetary support to homeless populations directly (solely cash-based)
k43t6q,ge7ebdq,,Bright idea:  Give everyone a card and an 8 digit pin. Put 1000 dollars a month on it. Everyone is happy, no one steals, nobody is homeless by misfortune. Whether you have a family, are homeless, or whatever, 1000 will help. A floor for poverty in short.
k43t6q,,ge7np9o,Universal Basic Income - yes !
k27fxw,gdsssv4,,I wish more churches would get on board with this. Isn't this were Kerouac's funeral was held? Either way, he'd be as glad to see it now as the rest of us.
k27fxw,,gdt2ip2,That was a different church less than a mile away. That one was converted to condos.
k27fxw,gdsrbs3,,Now that's a church that really cares for its community. Thank you for sharing the wholesomeness
k27fxw,gdt9el5,,More churches should do that!!!
k27fxw,gdttjzu,,ALL churches should do this. Thanks for posting!
k27fxw,gdtqd3i,,That's a very nice token gesture.
k27fxw,,gdttnos,It's a lot more than that.
k27fxw,,gdtvmja,How do you figure?
k27fxw,,gdu1qqc,A token gesture implies its meaningless pandering. This has real world benefits. Not sure if applicable ti that city but in ones where public camping, loitering, sleeping, etc. Is banned this could be a huge boon.
k27fxw,,gdu29p7,Actually, the meaning of "token gesture" is "an action or a decision that is so small or inconsequential as to be only symbolic" which, IMO, is exactly what this is. It's a very nice token gesture for the church to allow homeless people to set up their tents overnight around that huge, insulated, warm, weatherproof, safe building.
k27fxw,,gdu2pdo,How do you consider providing a spot a person can sit around and/or sleep without having to head miles outside of town or risk arrest for sleeping elsewhere in public to be purely symbolic? It has very obvious and definite benefit.
k27fxw,,gdu3ebf,Let me ask you: If Jeff Bezos suddenly decided to give all of his Amazon warehouse workers a 50¬¢/hour raise, would you consider that to be a token gesture? Given a 40-hour work week that's another $20 in each employee's pockets every week ‚Äî a "very obvious and definite benefit" since, after all, it's another $20 that they didn't have.
k27fxw,,gdu3rnz,No, why would i? Especially if he PERSONALLY did that with his own money? You must have an insanely entitled world view to think giving away freely is somehow lessened because you didnt give away "enough" (by somebody elses standard)  Like jesus fuck dude
k27fxw,,gdu49li,I just asked the question so I could understand your position. Why the harsh language and personal attacks? Seems unnecessary to me.
k27fxw,,gdu4g1j,Wasnt a personal attack lol. You said straight up its a token gesture because they could in theory let them in the building. If you dont see thats a ridiculously entitled mentality idk what to tell ya.
k27fxw,,gdu2qup,It is a step in the right direction.   It does a little something as a one off, but it could do a lot if it was the case for many thousands of religious buildings and the movement could be built upon.  It's a guarantee that however little you have, it is allowed to exist in a certain place without the government confiscating it.  It doesn't solve the problem of it not being insulated in the Boston winter (though with blankets it's a hell of a lot better than no tent).  It doesn't solve the problem of people stealing from the tent and thus the anxiety of whether you'll have anything in it when you get back to it.  But by taking the bold (for this area, not so much for the west coast) stance that they will allow their property to be used without fee by those who need a place to store stuff and sleep, it opens the door a little bit towards that being viewed as normal.  Next up would be if they allowed non-profits to make more weather hearty and lockable structures around tent size (which can be made for about a $1,000 and can really help someone sleep and accumulate enough possessions to start to have a future).  Keep following that path and you get to Sheds with solar panels, keep going and you get to tiny homes with running water and electricity (personally I think that's more or less the end goal, though many think that apartment sized housing available at no cost to anyone is the goal).   For evidence, see Dignity village in Portland (they have a website).  It started as a mobile tent village that moved to different churches so as to not overstay their welcome at any one.  But it's existence gave it political and social clout that ultimately ended up in todays Dignity village with a long term (permanent?) home, tiny houses, low fees, the equivalent of an HOA to make sure everything stays in line.   I think it also set the tone for the numerous tiny homes, sheds, safe parking lots for the homeless that have come sense.
k27fxw,,gdu47l2,Aren't religions all about god (whatever you want to call him/her/it) and, by association, family, brotherhood, caring for your fellow man, helping the needy, etc? Isn't that like practically built into the definition of religion/churches to an important degree?  The Presbyterian church is about 900 years old. Since helping and being nice to people is allegedly a sort of core edict of their philosophy, don't you think they should have been doing this all along? You talk about a "movement" that could be built upon, "opening the door a little bit" to make tent communities more normal (which by itself is an appalling concept, but that's a different argument). What have the Presbyterians been doing for the past 900 years? If you're going to tell me that they HAVE been helping for the past 900 years then I'd say their "movement" isn't going anywhere.  Presbyterians are, as a demographic, one of the wealthiest religious groups around. The fact that you can look at a picture of a tent in front of a huge *and empty* multimillion dollar church in an affluent northeastern community and find nothing wrong with that is not something that I would ever want to be "viewed as normal".
k27fxw,,gdu81h5,I don't really care about the doctrinal positions of this group of skywizard believers versus some other group of spaghetti monster followers.  I have no idea what presbyterians have been up to.    For an incredibly long period of time there was an understanding that people where responsible for taking care of themselves, and death due to starvation was a fact of life but so was the ability to make your own way.  There was plenty of land relative to the population, and not a lot of restrictions on building houses (settler houses for instance where basically sheds created from local lumbar by the inhabitants, native american houses where community built from local materials).   At some point the population exploded, monopolies ran unchecked concentrating wealth and power, the government decreed that any structure less than 400 square feet which met a few hundred building codes was not allowed to be lived in, and here we are.  It's not the fault of any one person or organization it's a million little decisions that have led us here.  You can be pissed that some specific person or group hasn't come along and fixed this once and for all but it's a damn complex problem.  I say an entity allowing it's land to be used for housing is a good thing.  I say we need more of that.  I say it's a part of the path forward.  You can be upset that people aren't doing more.  I'm not telling you not to be upset.
k27fxw,,gdu9ikg,>I say an entity allowing it's land to be used for housing is a good thing. I say we need more of that. I say it's a part of the path forward. You can be upset that people aren't doing more. I'm not telling you not to be upset.  Gee, thanks for that, I guess.  I agree with you about the land bit, but I'm not upset that people aren't doing more. I'm disappointed by it, particularly by people/groups with more than ample resources to bring about *actual positive change* rather than token gestures for press releases, and who sell themselves as the purveyors of morality.
k27fxw,,gdvj2i8,They've actually gotten negative press/NIMBY for it. Beyond that I honestly don't know much about them one way or the other.
k27fxw,,gdv7qn4,There not doing token gestures and positive press is hardly the goal.  I'm on a phone so can't look but I think OP posted a picture and not an article.  Here in Boston area it's not just this church.  There's multiple.churches around that have started relaxing about tents showing up an other makeshift squats on their land.  None of them seem to allow more than one or two people, probably because of concerns about how the folks will interact plus not wanting to completely piss off their neighbors.    My faith community hosts an organization which stores and distributes materials like blankets and coats as well as does.homeless advocacy.  Every year it's a struggle to bring on enough money to pay the upkeep costs on our building.  There isn't some bounty of cash that's come rolling in because of all the great press.  There's no press.  We just do it.
k27fxw,,gdvg6ic,You‚Äôre continue to miss the point, and you appear to be so enamored of religion that you‚Äôre actually lauding their efforts to ‚Äúnot piss off their neighbors‚Äù by restraining themselves from actually being a driving force for real, positive change. I don‚Äôt understand that mentality so....yeah. Seeya.
k27fxw,,gdvsho5,Yeah, I think you're talking about the hypocriticalness of religious communities not doing enough, and I'm talking about finding a path out of the homelessness epidemic using any resources available.  So we're having two different conversations.
k27fxw,,gdvpv85,This is anything but meaningless to those that are being helped.  You don't get that?
k27fxw,,gdvrnri,Tossing a drowning man a floating piece of wood can be considered ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. But doing so while cruising by on your 400 foot yacht while simultaneously preaching to the world that they need to help their fellow man? That‚Äôs a token gesture.  You don‚Äôt get *that*?
k27fxw,,gdxd1dq,Not at all. Sorry. Hope you never become homeless. If you do, this kind of 'gesture' would be very welcome.   Trust me.
k27fxw,,gdxs3v7,>Not at all. Sorry.  That's a shame. Cheers.
k27fxw,,gdy6i11,Oh, a troll. My bad for engaging. Cheerio.

k207ak,gdridyc,,I'm so sorry your family is blinded by dark thoughts and can't see the amazing soul you have within. Don't ever let anyone's (family or strangers) disgraceful thoughts on your homeless situation bring you down. Those are people that have many hard lessons to learn in order to have empathy and compassion. They are lacking any kind of humanity and that is not your fault.   You have a beautiful heart and an incredible soul. So what if you don't have a home yet? That does NOT give anyone the right to look down on you. Just because you are homeless doesn't mean that you are any less of a human than those with homes. I can tell that you have a hell of a lot of empathy, compassion, kindness and sympathy for people that are struggling and are in dark times. These are unique human traits that many people with money lack.      So please, ignore anyone that demeans and belittles you due to your current situation. Raise your head high and be proud of the beautiful soul that you are. Keep being you!! You will make the world a better place simply for being the beautiful human you are. God bless you.
k207ak,,gds510e,Thank  you for the **extremely** kind words and wishes. You too have a wonderful soul. :)

k207ak,gdrg8vf,,Same wishes to you & thanks for posting this. I love that another homeless dude helped. And not surprised. I don't even call my family anymore for the holidays. Just upsets everyone and gives them a chance to yell and scream at me and tell me how worthless I am and what a disappointment I am to them. I feel like they don't want me to exist.

k207ak,gdrraxz,,My family was the same, only they were very sycophantic until my career situation imploded.

k207ak,,gdt3saa,Huge accomplishment. Congrats!
k207ak,gdsatey,,I might be misunderstanding parts of your story - so, if I am then sorry. I just think that if the old friend told you that your family thinks lowly of you, she has not started the holidays with a very good heart. Family dynamics are complicated and there can still be love in there. See your family through your own eyes and let them see you through theirs. It's your story, not hers. Sending peace.
k207ak,,gdsdg02,Slight misunderstanding. A homeless friend is the one who gave me a meal this morning; the family who I thought I would share the Thanksgiving meal with basically expected me to beg and grovel for a meal that I thought we would all enjoy together outside, or after they ate we would hang and I would eat, considering it was Thanksgiving. Instead, it was quite the opposite.  Since then, I think something's broken and I have no plans to be in contact anymore.  I'm not going to grovel in the dirt for a meal I thought would be enjoyed together, and certainly not on thanksgiving.  I've noticed what others here say is true; people expect you to suddenly be a lesser person because you have this misfortune to experience homelessness. I never thought it would be them, but here we are.   This is likely karma from an old life that I have now, as I've never looked down on anyone in this life, and certainly not the homeless. I used to volunteer often actually and help many people before all of this. It is OK though; I know I have a spot reserved in a heaven realm whatever happens, so I am not to worried depending on the way things go or the choice I may make.  Blessings to you! :)
k207ak,gdsjuou,,Sorry you went through that. But, what's up with the title?
k207ak,,gdx2d52,In Buddhism, it's understood that there are different realms with different beings, who have been born there due to past actions, intentions, thoughts, and words. They are the many heaven realms, the human state (key and best for enlightenment), the animal state (we know this well) and the hell realms. Enlightened beings enter into a different state where they can choose rebirth at their will, not due to karmic imprints.  Due to my own intentions, always good, and my actions, I will have my choice of the heaven state or the human state, whatever I prefer. Currently, the human era is declining from 100 years to 10. I didn't believe that was the case at first, always the skeptic, but I understand now with my own vision that is the current case, due to the virtue and actions of the people currently born and being born. I wished it would change for the longest but I see now it cannot.  With faith, I trusted we would go up, but I realize true charity is very rare and degeneration is common at this time. This being the case, this is why we are set to go down.  Now, in my particular case, I was planning to come back even if we did decline to 10 years, to help those beings out, but I realize that even in this time, it is difficult for me to endure and press on. More than just this incident with my family, I have other things that aren't looking so good and likely won't for a while. The only way I could help on a massive scale in the current human state is to return as a prince or king, and I've already done that in recent lives and have no desire at this time to do so in the current climate. I appealed to the current king to set the wheel of generosity in motion for all mankind, but I never received an answer.  I have served humanity and animal kind faithfully, peacefully, and with humility. I have spoken with the devas and offered them advice when it was needed. I have even served hungry ghosts and even beings in the hell realms.  Mind you, this isn't part of Buddhism at all, I'm simply sharing my reasoning and personal experience, which happens to have such a spin.  It might be that soon, I'll take a bit of a vacation in the heaven realms. I don't know how the winter will go. If it does some how happen, I'll return at a later time to the human state to return on the upward rebound. Also, I may leave the area I'm at and move elsewhere. Thus the title. Best wishes and thank you for your time. üôÇüôè

One of them, when they found out I wasn‚Äôt on the train anymore (was taking a shit during a brief siding and it peaced lol) straight up jumped off on the fly.. like 40 mph or more, bounced off the ballast, and hitched a ride back to me. Insane. True friendship man.
k1do18,,gdoij4i,Yeah, some of the nicest people I‚Äôve met have been at the shelter. In life, people are usually ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù or trying to keep their cards close to their chest so no one else learns anything helpful.  When I got to the shelter, I was surprised by how nice and helpful were. You ask a question, and they give you helpful advice. And these are the people that society tells you are no good.
k1do18,gdnm70t,,Or they‚Äôll just drop you and the convo when you say that you‚Äôll be living out of your car (true story). At least I got to see her for who she really is.
k1do18,,gdnmqm6,Yes. That has happened, too.  Like you, I told a (well-off) close friend, and they just went ‚ÄúOh, cool! You could write a journal and make something cool out of it!‚Äù  This friend‚Äôs family has multiple houses, btw.
k1do18,,gdoeqxy,Well if they are still your friend that‚Äôs a good friend to have. they likely know hiring managers or biz owners ceos ect

Don't at all question the sheer audacity at the idea of someone owning the land, and ignore the fact that people need shelter. /s

k1do18,gdnyd7z,,I didn't have any friends before I became homeless, when I became homeless, or after I became homeless. I lost my faith in everything long ago. I lost my ability to trust anyone long ago. Without some level of trust, you cannot have any kind of relationship.
k1do18,,gdo4ava,Same
k1do18,,ge1ij7b,Join us at /r/ForeverAlone
k1do18,,gds7i0t,Goddamn, this is exactly where I am starting to get. Honestly, if I wasn't a long practicing Buddhist, I think I would have ended it weeks ago.  People simply just don't understand this.
k1do18,,ge1iqwp,How did Buddhism help you? Ending it seems like a realistic choice for me.
k1do18,,ge4jv07,Man that's horrible to hear. I don't know you whatsoever but I know that you ending your life is the *wrong* option. I'm not saying that because it's all fury and cliche' but because its true. You have a lot to give and there's a lot of people who *need you;* people who needs someone with experience in life to help them with the same exact things you yourself are going through. And I believe that your value isn't merely in what you can offer but just in the fact that you are a human being with innate value (as I believe we're all made in the Image if God).  feel free to talk to me anytime you feel and I'll be an ear...  but right now, If you don't mind telling me, what led to all of this?
k1do18,,ge5293u,Teachings of compassion, loving kindness, wisdom and various other really useful, really wise teachings help us bring our minds, spirits, hearts, to a very good point where, even if we have very little or a bad situation, we can overcome.  Metta, anapanasati, mantras, sutras, are all helpful terms to check into.
k1do18,gdo2nr9,,This hits home, damn. That's why you gotta stay positive and believe in yourself.
k1do18,gdoek5p,,or even show them your poor or live in a bad building. I lost so many people I have no one now. Looking forward to meeting people when covid is mostly beat later (maybe by summer of fall) infancy have boundaries and a bit of self esteem!
k1do18,gdoxqci,,Yep, when you're on the ground, everyone will line up to take kicks. People are secretly awful and spiteful. Being homeless allows you to truly see humans as they are.
k1do18,,ge1jc3n,> when you're on the ground, everyone will line up to take kicks.   Damn. Too true.
k1do18,gdopman,,who cares. friends come and go all your life
k1do18,,ge1jdks,But mostly they just go
k1do18,gdp6dej,,My so-called best friends all disappeared as soon as I lost my housing. I've never asked for help but maybe they worried I would. Not really sure what happened  there but I don't believe in best friends, anymore.
k1do18,,gdqdmhj,Yea they cut off communication to ensure you don't ask them for assistance. I wasn't asking for a hand out but a hand up.
k1do18,gdod35d,,Yep, I found that out real fast.
k1do18,gdpeyhs,,When I got into recovery 31 years after, after being homeless two times in my life (at 17 and at 25) I realized there were two types of people in the world, those who are trying to be "perfect" and those were were at one with all the handicapped, outcastes and those who truly make the world a better place.  I decided I would try to be a part of the second group.
k1do18,gdoczdv,,[A little piece I wrote from when I was homeless. Happy Thanksgiving and many blessings! iüòÄüçÅ‚ô•Ô∏è](http://visionary-news.com/2020/04/18/the-law-of-attraction-and-homelessness/)
k1do18,gdol3rq,,So true.
k1do18,gdpjyq0,,I was beyond lucky.  My friend asked her mom if I could stay with them till I found housing, and they did.  My other friends made multiple sacrifices so we could live together.  A friend from a different state offered me advice and bought me groceries once.  I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them, and my heart goes out to everyone surviving homelessness without the support system I had.  As long as I have a home, any and every one of my friends has a home.  Anyone who treats "friends" differently isnt a friend in my book.  I'm so sorry your friends reacted shitty, OP.
k1do18,gdolqaw,,Yup. Those are sociopaths I think. They come under the guise of help, but really are on a power trip. You‚Äôre in a vulnerable state and they keep maligning you with their vileness inside of them. You gotta just walk away from them. They‚Äôre not your friends. Never were. They‚Äôre not anyone ones friends.
k1do18,gdo4vz2,,When I became homeless, the people who helped me the most were people I met while traveling.   Long term friends of 16 years didn't lend a hand at all, and now believe I'm a lazy mooch that only wants hand outs. Even though I've literally never asked for anything until I found myself in a bad place.  It's true. I'm even hesitant to tell people I'm friends with now that I was homeless at some point in my life because a lot of these people start acting weird about it, like I'm diseases or something.
k1do18,,gdo8va7,Ugh! I relate to this so hard it stings!   I started a new essential job at the beginning of the Pandemic and didn‚Äôt tell anyone I was living in my car. I spoke to practically no one and felt kinda stealthy & bad-ass/mixed with sub-human and feeling dirty tho I presented better than my housed coworkers.   I started a better essential job in July and decided to just live honestly. I was tired of hiding and feeling less than. Most staff have been super kind, receptive- some have offered help. But now-it‚Äôs getting colder and the holidays are heavy and no one seems to understand why I‚Äôm a raging bitch.   You can‚Äôt come into work complaining it‚Äôs cold when I live out here! Makes me so angry how unaware people Are.
k1do18,,gdpnm6v,On a nice note, I had one female coworker come up to smoke weed with me after work and she saw the little setup I built to live in. Her eyes were wide and unprompted she said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let anyone every make you feel like a bum. You are a strong woman to live this way and are kicking ass‚Äù.  It was and is the nicest most validating thing I‚Äôve heard in years.
k1do18,,gdpk0fw,A lot of people don't realize just how truly sheltered they really are from really difficult living, they think having to pay bills so they have shelter, heat, a shower, their own toilet, a soft bed, a kitchen, good food, etc is the WORST and they are so burdened by such things! I agree that living paycheck to paycheck must suck, but they have loads of  comfort and luxury. So they complain about 5 minutes of cold walking from their SUV into the office while you struggled with like 15 hours of it.   I don't tell anyone at my new job because I'm entertained at being thought of as relatively a normie but everyone outside of work knows these days because I've been done hiding any part of my life for a few years now.
k1do18,,gdoocjt,Really fuckin says something when your working for months and still homeless. I haven‚Äôt lived in the street while working but I‚Äôve had others couches as beds and man, it‚Äôs rough
k1do18,,gdpnqvh,Yeah. Mind you at just above minimum- I also own my vehicle and have no debt. Been cash only for 5 years. I don‚Äôt have high credit score tho. It‚Äôs a crap white either way. It‚Äôs not built for the workers to thrive.
k1do18,gdqc0kd,,That's exactly what happened to me! I'm dealing with the pain and emotion of it all.
k1do18,gdsm3jm,,It's too common. I've had a lot of family do this and it's sad. Of course then they're in the perfect position to play victim because you rejected their "help" and "after all they did for you" you just wouldn't give them a little extra money or this or that so you're the bad guy.   &#x200B;  I've never had friends do it, only family members, which is really a shame because my family is not rich and a lot of them have been homeless at some point in their life too.
k1do18,gdnr2z4,,That‚Äôs how the South Park episode night of the living homeless was. Randy and friends escape to the roof, only for one of them to get a call that the bank took their house and don‚Äôt have a place to return to. So randy shoots him in the face.
k1do18,,gdnrjsr,Sloppy analogy joshua
k1do18,gdp8gpx,,I remember the day when I got the eviction notice for my old place, the first words out of my now ex-girlfriend's mouth were "I don't know what you're going to do".  She already had everything planned out for herself in advance, which was fantastic for her. But she left me to face homelessness by myself without any kind of help.
k1do18,gdqe668,,I have no friends. No one cares when it doesn‚Äôt affect them
k1do18,,gdr5h7u,Sorry about that. That seems pretty bad.
k1do18,gdzevfx,,Been there done that, the person who always claimed that he helped me so much got angry any time I refuse to do what he ordered. When I got a chance to leave him I felt so relieved.
k1do18,ge5ioer,,My family just asked me to return any keys I had of their properties. Thanks for the understanding guys.
k1do18,gdq0d8j,,Or better yet only help you if you leave who you are married to cause they dislike the fact he wont change himself to please them ..
k1do18,gdqs6b2,,They bout to get knocked out
k1do18,gdww89c,,Wow I'm going through some similar episodes. People really like to see people down. It's sad.
k1do18,ge0g3i6,,I have a different perspective.  At three different times in my life I let friends move in with me when they became homeless.  All that was expected was that they finds jobs.  In all 3 cases I had to ask them to leave after 6 months because none of them had found a job.  One only applied on two jobs in 6 months, one was just spinning mentally, but could still manage to go on dates and the last had a major drinking problem.  One friend I never heard from again, with the second friend it took years to repair our relationship and the last one joined AA and turned her life around.  I don't think I would let someone move in again.
k1do18,gee09k5,,It‚Äôs not a matter of true friends, I truly believe human nature is not compassionate we are animals after all. I mean if your friend right now said they were homeless would you drop your things and go full first into helping them? And I mean it with your own homelessness and all.
k1do18,gge282m,,My mom and I were out of a place to live in and her "best friend" had a basement. My mom asked to stay, she changed the subject and said how sorry she was to hear about our situation.
k1do18,,gge2izz,Sorry that happened. That seems terrible.
k1do18,,gge2s78,It felt awful and people just suck. We're okay now though, it was a few years ago
k1do18,gdpjqpa,,üëè Applause! Another raw and truelth serum for seeing who really IS your friend or Your Lover is tell them that "I am broke" or I have NO money!

k1q7p7,gdslqg3,,I'm no longer homeless (I was for years, many nights spent on the streets in my day). I didn't go see family or anything but there was a bar serving free food. Turkey, stuffing, green bean casserole and pie.   &#x200B;  So, while I didn't have any big family gathering or any of that warm, wholesome stuff, I did go to a bar which gave out free food. I'd like to think that's the next best thing.

k1q7p7,,gduutpn,Have you ever slept on cold hard concrete for months without any access to a washing machine, shower, food?   If you accumulate things they will get stolen. Documentation things like passport, bank account, birth certificate, access to something that will shave your hair or give you a clean face?   No access to people in a position of authority or people that can provide jobs? Ridiculed by the masses for trying to do everything right? Harassed by the people who's wages you've worked hard to pay for so THEY can have a healthy upbringing and a stable life while your life is in constant disarray dealing with there mental health problem but that doesn't matter because they have a shinny suit?  No documentation, looked down upon, unable to show yourself in a good manner, lack of facilities. Dealing with the great unwashed.

k0mq4v,gdl0uis,,Good for you, congrats! But what work commute do you mean? And I wonder what education you followed
k0mq4v,,gdl12px,I mean the commute from my camp to work. And what do you mean about education?
k0mq4v,gdjxf4h,,Great.  One hurdle down, of course bike maintenance is a new hurdle you have to deal with and it's not something you want to ignore.   Having bike commuted for about 20 years, here's my suggestions in order of importance:  Edit:  Someone else said get a bicycle lock.  I didn't even think to say that, but, yeah if you don't have a lock that is top priority.   It needs to be a thick lock (U-lock), not some skinny little cable lock that comes from the bicycle section of box store.  People can cut the cable locks with many tools, whereas a U-lock typically requires a grinder that most folks won't have on them.  You want to lock the bike to thick metal things, ideally bike racks bolted to concreate but those might not be common in myrtle beach.  Street signs are the most common good choice.  Don't lock to breakable things like wood railings, I've seen multiple bikes stolen when they where locked to things which someone can just pull and push on to break.  What type of tires do you have (skinny, fat?), the real thing to know is when you look on the side of the tire it should say something like "Max inflate to XX kpa (YY psi)".   You want to know what the "YY" (psi) number is (don't get mixed up and use the kpa number instead of the psi number).   Once per week (if the number is 60+) or every other week (if the number is below 60) you want to pump both your tires up to just below that number.   Any bicycle pump should have the ability to read the PSI on a guage while you're pumping.  Most any bike shop will have a "curtesy pump" usually near the front of the store that you can use.  If you let them get too low you'll be much more susceptible to flat tires.  Other than that there's maintenance on the wheels (which will become "untrue" (wobbly) over time, but especially so the more you hit potholes and jump curbs, so do your best to be gentle on the bike, don't ride up and down curb bumps (like sidewalks) stay on the smoothest surfaces you can find and watch out for potholes (get to know your route to work and what bumps you might encounter and avoid them).  Next up is maintenance on the drive train (the chain and the cassette (chain rings) that it goes on).  It's good to get a little bottle of bike lubricant from the bike shop and if you hear the sound of metal scrapping on metal when you are biking stop and put some lubricant on the chain.  You should hear the metal on metal sound go away within a few minutes of lubricating the chain.  Those 3 things are the majority of problems you'll encounter with a bike, of course there's quite a bit more, but you can only focus on so much.
k0mq4v,,gdko5kj,I don't really know that stuff. It's like a mountain bike I guess.
k0mq4v,,gdl240u,Got it, so it's got fat tires with knobs on them so it can ride in grass and gravel and such.   Still everything I wrote applies.   Look on the side of the tire and you will see  "Max inflate to ...  YY psi", you want to keep the tires pump up to near that psi number (but not over) every couple weeks (not terribly important for your big tires but at least once a month).   Ride gently and don't take bumps/curbs to save your wheels.  Put lubricant on the chain if you start to hear metal scrape on metal   If there's a bike shop on the way to work you can use their curtesy pump once a month and ask if you can get a little lubricant for a dollar rather than owning your own bottle you have to keep up with.  They'll probably be pretty generous if they know you depend on that bike to survive.
k0mq4v,,gdl2gnc,What about like a little air pump from Walmart? It doesn't have psi thing on it.
k0mq4v,,gdl3blo,You won't have hardly any accuracy pumping up with those, but, it's better than nothing.   If it's one of those small hand held ones that mount on to the bike, they're more for emergency use and really hard to pump tires up with.    You don't have a bike shop near you?  I believe there's several of them along the main drag there in Myrtle.  Any bike shop should have a free pump with a gauge.
k0mq4v,,gdl3oj2,Yeah there's places I just didn't know that about air in tires.
k0mq4v,,gdlf93d,If you bought the bike from a bike shop the tires are already pumped up to the right amount.  If you bought if from walmart there's a chance that the tires are already low.

k0mq4v,,gdl3jmz,I dropped out of school because I was a foster kid. Couldn't finish because I was moved around a lot. Plus I been on my own since I was 14. No college. And I'm a gal not a guy lol.
k0mq4v,,gdl92m9,That's rough, my parents got divorced and I know that felt horrible when we moved at the time so I can't even imagine how it is when you move all the time. In what country do you live?

k0mq4v,,gdlhv4h,I live in the Netherlands, I'm still underage so I can't really help financially because it's international/intercontinental. I do have a computer to look things up you can't check with your phone. If you know a way I can help you please let me know, I'd be happy to help.

jzw3so,gdgj326,,I‚Äôm glad you got warm pajamas.   I suggest cross posting the situation with your toe over at r/askdocs. Tell them about the puss, pain, digging out whatever was in it, and now the numbness.    Numbness isn‚Äôt good.  I know it seems like it would be better than pain, but it‚Äôs not good. I hope you cross post.  I suggest examining the numb toes under bright light (cell phone light?) at least once a day; use a hand mirror that you prop up so you can examine the underside of the toes and between the toes. You‚Äôre looking for the slightest sign of injury or irritation that might lead to broken skin.  If it‚Äôs numb, you won‚Äôt experience pain to know it‚Äôs injured.
jzw3so,gdf5m97,,I'm an avid runner and what I can tell you is your body needs time acclimating to the distance. How far do you think you walk to work?  How's work? Is the pay enough for you to sustain in the winter?   If the pain in the toe is going away that is good news. The numbness could just be that its swelling. Keep walking weird on it because you're avoiding keeping pressure on it, giving it more chance to heal. Keep a look out for any color changes, even discoloration. Its an early sign of infection if it does.   About your teeth, do you have enough for a dental trip?
jzw3so,,gdf68il,It takes me a good 2-3 hours to get to work from my camp. Usually I take longer getting back because it's brutal traffic at night I just don't want to get hit. I probably won't be able to follow my original plan for the winter with what I'm going to make. I was trying to get up enough money to rent a room in a house but I'm pretty sure it's not going to happen. With the help of someone else I've been able to to see a dentist here and had a few teeth pulled so far. I need to get them all pulled out though. I have an appointment with the free clinic here in December so I'm hoping to get signed up for therapy and a few other things. I've been told that the dental care is not going on right now but I'm still going to ask about it I mean it can't hurt right.  My toe is kinda pale color compared to the others. The swelling is still there but it doesn't hurt. It was feeling like I had a splinter but I cut it open and drained it now it just feels a little swollen like a bruise.
jzw3so,,gdfaqi3,Oh man it hurts to know you have to walk that far for that long to go to work. I hope you will get that bike soon.   Pale is somewhat a discoloration. Keep an eye on it, if it pains it is almost certainly not good. Since you walk a lot its possible to confuse the pain. My First gout attack got worse because I couldn't tell the difference between gout and normal joint sore. Just keep that in mind.

Assuming you have a Walmart or other department store near you, try getting your hands on hand warmers, you'll most likely find them near the front door or by the camping equipment
jzw3so,gdfh7wf,,I don't know if you posted a pic of your toe, but it could be a corn. if you press on it, and it hurts,  it could be a corn. in that case, you want to off load it. I don't condone stealing but if u go to a dollar store and see those corn pads, try those, or take a look at what it is and you can make your own.  for gum pain, warm water and salt. the pain you feel is inflammation, which causes swelling, so gargle with salt water. it will also reduce the chance of infection. you want to take ibuprofen for that. rule of thumb is: bone pain : tylenol, muscle pain: ibuprofen.  being on your period does affect gums, and body heat (hormones).  staying warm: keep your head, neck and core covered. I used to wear a bandana, then a hat, scarf, tights, pants that weren't jeans, socks, long sleeve shirt and hoodie plus jacket. the hardest for me was keeping my feet warm. I can't sleep if my feet are cold. I tried all kind of ways. Warm potatoes, making my own hot water bottles, coals in socks, (not directly on toes) hand warmers, more lawyers, it was so hard and nothing lasted long. at the very least, newspaper and then stuffing my feet in socks.

That said, life boils down to trying to find happiness.  You get to define what happiness is.  If traveling the world as a homeless person truly makes you happy, then you, sir, have won life and found true freedom.  Although I can say I never want to be homeless again, a small part of me is jealous of your wonderful mindset.  Happy travels and I wish you many adventures.
jzkc7o,,gdcd4j9,You may be right about not finding any on here but I've met hundreds in tent cities and on the side of the road all over the country whom taught and inspired me to make the best of it so I could pass it on to the next. And I know for many reasons we are greatly outnumbered but its bred a beautiful counterculture that I'd love to share with as many as possible before society really does make it impossible
jzkc7o,,gde18h3,the people who enjoy it are mostly on r/vagabond
jzkc7o,,gde1lb2,Thx big dawg
jzkc7o,,gdcwfun,You're talking about dirty kids,  right? Train punx?. I have a lot of close friends from high school that still hop trains and love it. I never went due to my love for climate control and wifi. That being said, ive been in a tent for 2 years now, since I was 4 months pregnant, within five miles of my parents home im unable to live at without agreeing to Give my stepsister(who's barren) my child. (No my xhild isn't with me shes with a relative until housing comes thru ) I was the most clueless outdoor person you can imagine. There are parts where its not so bad, I guess, but its overshadowed ultimately by the shame, regret, cold, or blistering Texas heat, and how much I hate not being able to provide for my children....but everyone is different. But, I have met people like you.
jzkc7o,,gdcy1uj,I'm not specifically talking about any type of person but have been categorized as such and I'm sorry I truly do understand not being able to be there for your child. Ive been working on sending my babys mother more money over time in Hope's of finally being allowed to see him but still no dice. I left my dog and gf at the time in california and hopped trains and hitchhiked there to ohio in time for his birth while skipping my best friends funeral all for the sake of being in his life but was not very well received(even told that they would call the police if I showed up to the hospital to sign the birth certificate) So lately I've been biding my time doing my best to send gifts and money when I can so that hopefully I can meet him by is second birthday
jzkc7o,,gdd3war,So you‚Äôre a homeless 23 year old junkie with a torn ACL, whose friends are dying, and who is not allowed to see his child and you‚Äôre wondering why people aren‚Äôt interested in life advice from you?  You‚Äôre never going to be allowed to see your child in the state you‚Äôre in, so if that‚Äôs a thing you actually give a shit about maybe you need to face the fact that you‚Äôre not actually living your best life. I‚Äôm sorry it compares so favorably to the home you must have come from. That sucks. But there IS a better life for you if you‚Äôll just be honest with yourself.
jzkc7o,,gdeakxs,I'm also 23, and just about the same as him, I see your point of view and know many people with your opinions. That being said why cant you just let people be happy, does it utterly destroy you that someone could be happy? Give me a break.
jzkc7o,,gderg2w,You actually don‚Äôt see my point of view if you think I don‚Äôt want him to be happy. I‚Äôm actually concerned about his long term well being. Short term pleasure and avoiding your problems do not equal happiness. And if he wants to be truly happy in the long term he needs to take stock of where his life actually is while he can still do something about it.
jzkc7o,,gdery60,Everybody's view of happiness, is not the same as yours if hes got problems he can acknowledge them on his own. He said he quite happy, frankly I believe him, dont be so quick to judge everyone is all I'm saying. You are right in your head just like he is his. It's ok bro.
jzkc7o,,gdd4dse,It does suck but what's the point in wallowing? There's better ways to spend my time and energy. Thanks for summing up all that though I really never thought about any of that lol  Edit: I know I'm a josh but you really seem like a brad
jzkc7o,,gddh5qk,Nobody is saying wallow. I‚Äôm saying make changes and get your shit together, so you can have a long healthy life and get to know your fucking child.  I‚Äôm not saying this because I want you to be miserable. I don‚Äôt want you to be hopeless or depressed about your situation. But I do want you to change it. Right now you are a kid‚Äôs homeless, druggy parent that they are not allowed to see. Imagine growing up with you as a father. Is that who you want to be?  You obviously have a ton of courage and resiliency. You‚Äôve had amazing experiences that most people will never get to have. And if you can get along on the street you can get through anything. The life you are living isn‚Äôt a waste... but it isn‚Äôt sustainable either. Look at the people on the street who are older than you. Not just a few years but 20 or 30. Is that who you want to be in 20 years? People won‚Äôt take you in anymore. You won‚Äôt have your health. And it will be much harder to make any kind of change. How many people do you even see who are older than that? If they‚Äôre alive are they still having fun?  I‚Äôm not trying to be down on you. I just want you to do better. For yourself, for your kid and for the people who may line up to believe in the horseshit you‚Äôre selling.
jzkc7o,,gddhk8s,Dude I totally agree 100% and am working in that direction but it doesnt happen overnight. In the meantime I'd rather make an impression expressing the ways I know how to bring someone outta the mud as opposed to focusing on my own problems that I can and will sort out myself
jzkc7o,,gdef46a,Why do you care how this person chooses to live his life? I know a guy who spent 40 years working at the post office and hated every single day of it. He did it for his dad. If a person has found their groove they are blessed. Stop thinking you have any idea how this guy should live his life.
jzkc7o,,gde5npo,How can you make changes when you couldn't fight the things that make someone homeless?
jzkc7o,,gdes5o6,Hes not homeless hes exploring have you been where he has? This post is not for losers like you to dehumanize and feel better about yourself. Go to another sub if you feel like this is the way. Give yourself a break we all know your kingshit. Lmao putting your 2 cents in when not kind might get you hurt one day.
jzkc7o,,gdf41hj,well fuck to you german white supremacist, I dont owe you anything
jzkc7o,,gde0sc1,I dropped out of making good money and living the standard life, and switched to minimal living by choice.  It's challenging at times, but I have few regrets. Most of my regrets are about resisting the draw of freedom and clinging to my comfort zone.  I don't drink, and I don't spange, and I'm happy.
jzkc7o,,gdcnpj3,I'm like minded. It really feels like I was always meant for this. It's a constant rush, almost like a drug.
jzkc7o,gdcczxh,,I think you‚Äôll probably find more like minded people in r/vagabond to be honest
jzkc7o,,gdcdgnb,Yea I've tried sadly but a lot of them take travelling way too seriously andor trustfund kids and even some of the mods are quite keen to even tell people to get jobs lol
jzkc7o,,gdd21my,Lmao! The first reaction most people will have to someone who is unemployed is ‚Äúget a job‚Äù like thanks, I didn‚Äôt realize that was something people do to get money!
jzkc7o,gdcoucz,,I‚Äôm with you man, apparently our opinion is unpopular  Yeah waking up wet from rain sucks. Having shit stolen sucks. Having people automatically hate you sucks.   I had a super rough childhood, so homelessness is a better extension of that. I was a runaway, so homelessness feels natural to me. Being in a house with a job feels unnatural, I tried it for 4 years and it made me suicidal.   Homelessness brings me a sense of peace, as my worries and anxiety are directly related to my choices and experiences, instead of the irrational what if‚Äôs I was doing so much of when I was housed
jzkc7o,,gdcqb4h,Hell yea I can totally relate with you there. It's also what I know best and for me is my comfort zone but also in a way homelessness shows you how to expand your comfort zone
jzkc7o,gdckimv,,Squattheplanet forum is probably your spot. I align with your mindset now and then, but whenever I'm too busy guarding my emotional well-being, the walls go up and my appreciation dwindles. For me, travel and subsequent homelessness was sometimes/sometimes not by choice, largely in part due to either mania or something else. It's kept me from ending things to move on and keep going, so I feel appreciative for the escape it's offered me-- to lean into curiosity and adventure. I'd rather be going somewhere and seeing someone new when things haven't worked out in one place, and hitchhiking or other means have offered that perspective shift with a literal change of coordinates.   Lots to be thankful for. I think STP will be right up your alley.
jzkc7o,,gdclb0z,Yea? I'll definitely check it out sounds super cool just by the name. And I think were more alike than you think I was miserable at one point and still have my occasional bouts, but I've seen the affect sticking to a positive mindset has on others I meet and try to focus on that and it helps me too in the end by making those bouts less frequent. Not being able to walk for so long because of my knee was definitely one of those bouts. Anyway thanks for the advice I hope STP lives up to its name
jzkc7o,gdcsazk,,I got a buddy who vagabonds, met him in 2013 sitting on the steps of my apartment complex I lived at. He was a very eccentric character, hippy mixed with wizard type, who decided to try to settle down in an apartment with his GF and kid. He ended up getting a seperate apartment across the way from his gf and daughter and made it until winter of 2017 in that apartment. He ended up getting evicted and the next thing I knew he was in California, then somehow made it to Hawaii to ride out the winter. I'd keep in touch with him throughout his journeys to Rainbow Gatherings from one end of the country to the other. I still live in the same town and this summer I saw him walking with his daughter, he was in town for his daughters Bday for about a week. As of yesterday, he's chillin in Dallas, headed to Alabama and I probably won't see him for a few years yet. My point is, he's a really good friend of mine and many people have bad things to say about him because he's different even though he is super cool and respectful and wouldn't hurt a fly. Some of the coolest people I've met have been homeless or "homeless" in the eyes of normies and even though I'm now considered a "normie" I was once one of them having spent my whole life basically homeless as of 9 months ago. I'm celebrating 10 months sober in December and have settled down. Don't look down upon anyone, try to make a friend.
jzkc7o,,gdcspc5,Hell yea some hippies are really cool. But dont get me wrong, call me what youd like, but I think I'm on the other side of the spectrum lol
jzkc7o,gdcnids,,I've only been homeless about 3 months, but oddly, it's the happiest I've been in easily a decade. I love the freedom. I love the lack of responsabilities. I love seeing how good most humans are in how they treat me. I'm comming into some money in the next week and am still not sure I want to give up the life. i think what I will do is find someplace to live for the winter (Canadian here so it's coooolllddd) and live homeless from apr-oct each year.  An example of something I loved from last night, that would terrify most. i ended up sleeping in a construction zone where a new highrise is going up. I slept almost in plain sight, but it was in the shadow of some wood. I essentially was 100% visible, but unless you looked right at me, you'd walk right by I figured. Well, security went by several times that night and not one time did he see me. i giggled like a kid each time. That's def not for everyone, but for me I felt like a ninja in a video game. Maybe tonight I'll try the Predator, "Over here!" whisper as he walks by. Trip the guy right out.  I try to explain to my brothers that I like being homeless. They think I'm nuts, i may well be, lol.
jzkc7o,,gdd0c9n,Take some pebbles to bed with you and toss one just behind him. He will pee his pants.  I was a security guard in a former time. I remember stalking up on a wharf rat eating a piece of fish. I touched it with my gloved hand and it exploded out of there.
jzkc7o,,gdco16h,Hell yea dude you're right on the money with that one no pun intended, I'm really happy for you though. Were all a little nutty so they'd probably understand. Like you said people are way better than most people give them credit for
jzkc7o,,gdd7vbk,Also btw I regret skimming past half your comment because ninja camping is a great topic for this thread. This one time in st Augustine florida I overheard a couple going through the worst, most dramatic breakup while ninja camping in the bushes lol keep up the mischief bud
jzkc7o,gdcr6zt,,I have a home with my wife and two children. So far, we have been extremely lucky in this climate, we haven't had to change our lifestyle this year (except the social restrictions/going out that CoVid induced) and are both still gainfully employed. That being said I find myself often thinking how the "working mans life" is really no more different then being a slave to the system. I cannot just up and leave to go to a different state/city. I cannot sell all my belongings and make a nice tripped out van (like the ones in r/vandwellers) . When I put thought into it, having a home/family/career makes me 'less' free.  Because others depend on me at this time, I have deferred the simple living until my children are all off on their own and then convince my wife to do the van thing with me.     Edit: I was briefly homeless for a few months after my parents kicked me out of the home (18 years ago) but I was never on the streets.
jzkc7o,gddddzz,,Do you have any tips or tricks for a newly noob homeless who is going to start roaming around in California?
jzkc7o,,gddeef3,Yes, tons! and it all depends on your background. I typically hate california because of the enormous homeless population and the problems the come with it. I.e. panhandling is much more difficult and there are much more anti homeless rules and architecture and how expensive everything is out there. But if you are a junkie and wish to stay one, california and the west coast is a great place considering how cheap the drugs are. Otherwise I'd suggest leaving the west coast and being homeless anywhere else depending on what your hobbies are. If you are serious, give me a little more background as to what you like to do and what you dont like and can give tips accordingly.
jzkc7o,,gddgqgx,But quite literally I suggest applying for ga and leaving california once you get it. It's a hellhole for noobs and vets alike and only good for the government assistance and cheap drugs. Terrible camping and constant harrassment from cops and other homeless people is a guarantee. Get out of there and make it as far east as possible if you want to live. If you want to die stay there
jzkc7o,gdefjw3,,I'm really proud of you for standing up for your way of life.   We judge and look down on people all the time. Smoking pot. Being gay. Dressing up as a furry.   I'm ALL about houseless pride. You are a strong person who has seen the world in a way most people never will. The good and the bad.   You be you.
jzkc7o,,gdefucl,Thank you that's one of the best compliments someone can get
jzkc7o,gdccu54,,I can say that we are very similar. Though I wouldn't say I love being homeless, more like I have a never satisfied wanderlust and quest to find somewhere I belong. I can heavily relate to the feelings of guilt and other ineffable feelings that come with staying with others as you know it's going to be temporary.   I guess I'll ask you how you make your income? How do you fund your travels and medical care?
jzkc7o,,gdcdoo5,Well it may be quite controversial but I panhandle and poorly busk with a ukulele lol but flying a sign makes the most. I like to see it as selling someone the feeling of generosity
jzkc7o,,gdcp60o,> I like to see it as selling someone the feeling of generosity  I give a couple bucks , remembering where I came from. It isn't going to fix anything, just making that day that little bit easier for someone.
jzkc7o,,gdcpg6n,Hell yea dude everyone has their reasons and it DEFINITELY makes a difference
jzkc7o,gddjc9d,,If a homeless person doesn't have a partner or doesn't do sex work, how does a single homeless person's sex life compare to a non-homeless person's?  Is the partner pool restricted to just the homeless population?
jzkc7o,,gddko0i,Wow that's a fantastic question! It all depends on hygenics and not in the way you would think. A person's sex drive is directly connected to their own hygiene. The better hygiene the higher the sex drive, and sex drive is recognized in so many different ways with humans especially smells and hormones. Without a proper sex drive that comes from proper hygiene, you wont produce the hormones that attract others regardless of the gender. At first I didnt realize this and only thought of how I was treated in the homeless community for being too clean and it was such a mistake. Personally I prefer woman that are tougher than others that can keep up with such a lifestyle and that's great and all but regardless of your preferences whether it be clean yuppies, dirty hobos, or whatever it always helps to work on your hygiene. But it's always in the air you just gotta open your nose
jzkc7o,,gddlro3,Thank you for the answer.  I hope you heal up soon and get back to the life that you love!
jzkc7o,,gde1fpd,I was never much of a "woman's man", so my sex life was pretty average beforehand. I am still not the type to pursue women, but my romantic life has improved tremendously, mostly because I can spend more time having a genuine conversation. I'd rather not get into the details here, but I'd estimate it's about 200% better, even after correcting for my age and experience.
jzkc7o,,gde1suc,That's really awesome to hear!  Confidence really makes the difference!
jzkc7o,,gdzdz72,My dude. You‚Äôre a smelly bum. You don‚Äôt have a sex life. You have a romantic life !! Lol !!
jzkc7o,gdduqsy,,I don't know how many people have posted r/vagabond. But apparently some people want to be preachy or to be big fish in a small pond.
jzkc7o,,gddvjbq,Good metaphor and I guess it seems to apply, though it wasn't supposed to be such a philosophical circle jerk it was quite fun
jzkc7o,gde0mgv,,I am an outdoors person myself (prefer not to use the term "homeless") and I have an off-reddit community you may find interesting and welcoming. PM me for the link.  What was it like for you to start out at 16? Was it a problem if you encountered police, since you were a "minor"?  I didn't get into it until I was in my 30s, although I had camping and traveling experience before then.
jzkc7o,,gde28ag,Thanks I'll definitely msg you in the am if I remember lol Its a long story though. Brother died of cancer and I lived in my dads basement. Coped with it in many ways but the one that caused it was sneaking my homeless friend in for a while via the basement door.  He lived in my closet for 6 months like anne Frank and when my dad found out he kicked us both out we than found a bando full of all this cool shit, furniture, a fireplace, and filled it with good friends til we all went different ways. Where I grew up in maryland there is absolutely no homeless population to teach you anything so we just took care of eachother the best we could while getting harrassed by the police non stop. Most of us turned out pretty great because of it
jzkc7o,,gdearqm,Lmao.. so harddd at Anne Frank'in'...too hard actually. What part of Md, im from Cecil co...
jzkc7o,,gdeb8fi,Lol you have no idea, one time I told my dad I went out for whatever reason. But we stayed there and were hiding in the double door closet and my dad came downstairs, stuck his nose through the gap in the doors, audibly 'sniffed' twice, and went back upstairs. Literally ome of the scariest and funniest moments of my life.  And southern maryland near 301
jzkc7o,,gdh4v1w,That's a fee-fi-fo-fum moment if I've ever seen one
jzkc7o,,gdec9az,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
jzkc7o,,gdeaqw6,Lmao.. so harddd at Anne Frank'in'...too hard actually. What part of Md, im from Cecil co...
jzkc7o,gdcersb,,Life in general amounts to finding happiness. To some it's making that first million so you can make the second million. Others it's to making enough to pay all the bills. Some of course it's getting enough for a bottle. Rare is the case when you find a career that you are good at, you enjoy, and make you a living. Now money won't buy happiness, but you can sure choose whatever misery you can afford. I for the most part, enjoyed being a hobo. I saw so very much of the US and it's people. Parts of Canada and Mexico also. When young enough to enjoy (or curse at) the country. So often I encountered those who slaved their entire life for a chance to travel in a RV and see the sight. Some did of course, but so many more had that plan destroyed by divorce, job loss, illness, or just plain worked themselves into an early grave. Now semi-retired at 68 I may not be able to travel again. Still should I be forced into an old folks' home, I can entertain my peers and probably staff, with many tales of travel.
jzkc7o,,gdcfluc,Hell yea dude you are quite right lifes wacky as hell especially when you take into consideration where every single type of person is coming from in regards to why they do what they do. I'm definitely not saying I made the best choice I've made hella mistakes and sacrificed a lot of friendships along the way, most people do. How was homeless culture different back than? Care to entertain a young hobo with a tale of when times were rumored to be better for us?
jzkc7o,,gdcfw6f,Simple answer that says it all. There were a few thousand, now there are a few million.
jzkc7o,gdcoo7o,,r/hobo is for housefree trainriding traveler types with little to no focus on negative stuff, if you want a pro-lifestyle subreddit. r/vagabond is far more popular and more appropriate for non-trainriders, though I don‚Äôt sub so don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs constant sad stories like r/homeless. Glad you‚Äôre warm and on the mend.
jzkc7o,,gdcqi1l,Also this may be too strong of an opinion but I think the terms hobo and vagabond are just words to help homeless people feel like they're better than other homeless people but nonetheless really cool communities have sprouted from such ways of thinking
jzkc7o,,gdcqu1n,Yeah you don‚Äôt qualify for r/hobo I guess if you think it‚Äôs all the same methmouth. that there is a distinct culture difference between homeless people and hobo. That‚Äôs on you. Stay off the rails kid.
jzkc7o,,gdcr3z5,Lol been on the rails for quite some time and that attitude is why I think it's an egotistical culture but otherwise very fun to rabbit hole into until you're copying every other train kid out there with face tattoos and a superiority complex
jzkc7o,,gdcq45p,Thanks but I'm already aware of those subreddits but you know vagabonds and hobos are alike in the same way that most start out as just plain homeless
jzkc7o,gdcmn4n,,Why do you think it's other people's job to support you? Are you unable to work or just unwilling?
jzkc7o,,gdco0qc,How in the world is anyone supporting him?
jzkc7o,,gdco56h,Someone makes the food he eats and clothes he wears. Someone is providing him with medical care.
jzkc7o,,gdcpbjx,Someone makes the clothes you wear, and unless you run a farm and hunt, the food you eat. Who says he has medical care? Btw, any civilized country except the U.S. has free medicare anyway. I'm homeless. I do not pan for money. I help myself.
jzkc7o,,gdcpotf,Everyone makes food and it is constantly going to waste. I may be getting a lot of handouts lately due to my inability to walk but dont ever think a single homeless person is lazy. Like one of my favorite lyrics states "if you dont wanna work than that becomes your job, there's a lot of overtime and not many days off"
jzkc7o,,gdcnd3m,I definitely do not expect or remotely think I deserve the kindness humanity has shown me over the years but for some reason they do and I try and give back as much as possible by helping as many other homeless people I meet in the ways I am most proficient i.e. dumpster diving and bumming smokes and alcohol out. But yes I work for free a lot of times and for cash sometimes when under the table. My criminal record and lack of credentials prevents getting a job and I've found that panhandling is what I do best. I'm able to do more for my communities by spending an hour panhandling and an hour dumpster diving rather than working all day for minimum wage
jzkc7o,,gdcoln4,I just get a bit salty about people claiming they're choosing to be homeless while still standing in line for free meals and donations. Are you voluntarily homeless or just trying to make the best of it? I guess I see those as being different circumstances.   There's nothing wrong with panhandling, dumpster diving or busking though! All are valid ways of getting your needs met!
jzkc7o,,gdcpaqe,I definitely did not choose to be homeless and it's a sad story that I do not like to recount like many of us on here but i made the best at it and became pretty good at it
jzkc7o,,gde7996,I'm unable to work because of my race. Im half asian but but my white side abandoned me my whole life and I now abandon them equally. Nearly all the jobs i apply to dont want and asian male. And I won't even think o ft applying to predominately white businesses. Think ill burn this country
jz1a07,gd93v1j,,Uhm, leave Key West Florida. It's notoriously unwelcoming for homeless, vagrants, or transients.
jz1a07,,gdakst6,Let's be compassionate. She's suffering now. She's not thinking about the long term. She needs to get by now
jz1a07,gd924r5,,I have been in Key West. Most likely they will just boot you out. Or maybe drive you to the old chain gang barracks that is used for their  homeless shelter. You might really be better off sitting out the fine in the jail down there. It's far better than the shelter. Not to mention they may buy you a ticket to get the hell out of their hair. I think it was like $3 to head up to Hileah just south of Miamis' sprawl. Key Largo area got some woodlands of sorts to jungle. There a soupline and a few other handouts, in the park where the tramps hang out there I remember some outfit handed out sack lunches. Much bettet to panhandle bus fare to Key Largo than hang in Key West. But thats just me.
jz1a07,,gd92ojt,Im only 19 and im female, would i be put in the same jail as all the druggies around here?
jz1a07,,gd93bis,You would go to a womens' section. I never been in that part, I'm a guy. That section if its like most will be hookers/addicts. The guy side is harder lawbreakers. Plus I am lots more willing to bet they tell you to leave town and don't come back. That's what they do to those homeless that won't go to the chain gang joint.
jz1a07,,gd94hd2,Hun, dang. Key West sucks ass, it‚Äôs gonna be super expensive to get anything, as you might have already noticed. Staying there will make things harder than they need to be.
jz1a07,,gd94s5w,I dont have much of a choice
jz1a07,,gd9q5vz,You are making the cardinal mistake of any new homeless person, you think you have to stay where you are. Walk, hitchhike, just move all the time until you find someplace to stay for a short term at least.
jz1a07,,gd951c1,Yeah, not much advice I gave you there. My friend, in the 90‚Äôs, got someone to drive him back up, hitchhiking. Be super careful, if you do go that route.
jz1a07,,gd95a27,Thats an instant arrest here, and the tourists hate people who ask for stuff. Should i try my luck with the cops? Some of them are sadistic, but surely all of them cant be heartless.
jz1a07,,gdama64,The city bus goes to marathon, it's cheap. A couple dollars. You can spange but don't fly a sign and be careful about asking too loud. The steps by the CVS across from hard rock, and the alcove next to the sex shop were hot when I was there years ago. The church is good, stay off Duval tho.   Try to find Cliff. He's a decent guy with community ties, friendly to vagabonds.   Don't ever try the cops there, they select them for their cruelty. There are absolutely no good ones on that island.  Fuck anyone who is on vacation there. Ask nicely, accept a no graciously. Be grateful for the smallest donations, even they're intentionally insulting, sometimes the person behind them can be driven to help by witnessing such savagery.
jz1a07,,gdap4wn,Thanks for the tips, ive actually been going to duval DAILY to charge my phone. Better find a new spot quick.
jz1a07,,gdapkui,Charging and eating and whatever is fine, even a little mobile crack spanging (where you ask people for change while remaining mobile, on your feet) works, just don't get carried away. But if your want to sit and try to make a little money do it on a side street, or an alley with walking traffic.   There are some good spots like this down off of Truman. Like, Truman and Whitehead. Try to make conversation with Cowboy George, he's gruff but good. He sits outside the Wendy's, of hes not there yet sitting around the corner. People who eat fast food on vacation kick down.
jz1a07,,gd95jw5,Yeah, it‚Äôs a gamble on who you‚Äôll get but chances are it won‚Äôt be bad if you go to them to see if they give you options.
jz1a07,gd9diry,,Not sure if its available in key west but have you tried contacting coalition for the homeless? They may have some resources to help you GTFO if i were you, id say go to new york. That's where I'm headed after i get my drivers licence.
jz1a07,,gd9dsub,When i called they were unbelievably rude! This is exactly the response i received before i was hung up on: "We dont help with that, byebye." Quite a rude tone too, all i wanted was a bus pass or a ticket to get somewhere safe.
jz1a07,,gda8wc0,Try the homeless coalition again, as if you‚Äôre on your first call. They can help locate safer shelter (do you even have a bear spray?), and one night in a shelter gets you a letter with an address if you ask nicely (beg and kiss up, really), and the address gets you SNAP. One step at a time!
jz1a07,,gd9e3yy,The only other thing that comes to mind is going to a mental hospital. There will be a case manager assigned to you that can help you get out of key west. When you have no other options, this becomes your best bet.
jz1a07,gd9gp0z,,Hi. Try this number (305) 296-0240. It's a shelter.
jz1a07,gd91s6p,,Anyway you can try to rest now and walk at night when it's cooler?
jz1a07,,gdamtz9,That's what I did for my first three days there. Slept in shadows on the beach.   Someone gave us a free kayak (with a dime-size hole in the bottom) and I paddled my wife and I back and forth to Wisteria island. Came to land to spange all day then packed back in the evening with food and beer. We had a bidding camp fire and a stove for cooking. There were fifteen of us, give or take, and we'd have communal dinners and movie nights. It's possible to hitch water rides back and forth from the island, but it can take a really long time to see someone boating in, or you have to get up super early and catch people going to work.
jz1a07,gdadavi,,Stay strong
jz1a07,gdarnsn,,Try 211 for resources on where to go. After some googling I found this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.shelterlistings.org/city/key_west-fl.html  Also, try reaching out to religious organizations. Catholics and LDS have a giant community (LDS specifically has a wonderful welfare system set up within the church)  https://fkoc.org- this is the Florida Keys Outreach Coalition for the homeless.
jz1a07,gdatv74,,Goto a certified Safe Place, maybe that would help. They help battered women and children.
jz1a07,gdirtqq,,How‚Äôs it going now
jz1a07,,gdkbfh4,I convinced a city bus to get me over to the homeless shelter. This place is so disgusting i cant believe its legal, but its better than sleeping in a tree.
jz1a07,gd983tr,,Is there any family or friends however extended that you can call for help. Maybe stay with them for a bit???? I know embarrassment, or not wanting to infringe on people is hard to overcome, but have to put aside. You‚Äôre at the end of your line.
jz1a07,,gd98hi2,Oh trust me, i would have. My only family is with my stepdad, who is sexually abusive towards me and the reason i ran away and became homeless. I have no friends able to support me financially.
jz1a07,,gd98uwg,No friend for them to allow you to sleep over a week or a few? You‚Äôll get your own job or public benefits until you get on your feet. It‚Äôs better to be hungry, but under a roof. You‚Äôll figure out the rest, but you just a need a footing. If they‚Äôre  any friend, they‚Äôll step up.
jz1a07,,gd992ss,They cannot, I'm only 19 and many of my friends are younger or around the same age. Most dont have money and are undergoing college. My only friend who is able to help is out of country.
jz1a07,,gd9fire,I'm the same age as you, and I'm so sorry your going through this so young. I completely understand how hard it can be find friends who are willing to take you in, it can almost be impossible at our age. I think a lot of people forget not everyone has a support background, or friends they can fall onto. Please message me if you need anything.
jz1a07,,gd9et9g,Perhaps your friends will allow tou to use their mailing address? Grab yourself food stamps, cash assistance, unemployment insurance, something you can barter with to get you into a better position...
jz1a07,,gdb2nc5,Dude I hate when people suggest this to the homeless. If that was an option they would do it already. It's almost as insulting as when a cop asks why you don't just get a hotel...
jz1a07,,gdb5bdm,I don‚Äôt know their predicament as to what options they have. A stranger asking strangers.   Sometimes people need a little encouragement. If it‚Äôs not their circumstance, they don‚Äôt need to take heed. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything. Their asking for advice, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to like all of it or take any of it. So if you don‚Äôt like it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong or right, just may not be right for you.
jz1a07,gd9synj,,Can I post this to my Facebook to raise awareness to this? Hopefully bring some sympathy for people struggling like that? I won't mention names. Just the text.
jz1a07,,gda1soe,Sure, i dont mind
jz1a07,,gdag2qv,Thank you sir! I hope things get better for you. If I can do anything let me know.
jz1a07,gd9s88d,,So, here's what I see according to your post. You are 19. No criminal record. No money. No friends to help you. A very abusive parent.You seem to be healthy, your body anyway. You are female. You have a few possessions with you. You are camping out. You don't want to leave. You don't want to go to a shelter. You don't seem to be on dope/booze. Well you are in the same conidition as a whole lot of young folks. You never been away from home? You are on your own now? You are getting lots of advice from people who been there? So now it is completely up to you what you will do. It would have happen anyway. I don't know why you waited so long? I had abusive parents and knew I had to leave before I did something so very much more stupid then stab my dad as he was beating the shit out of me so he would stop. Altho a guy, I was dumb as hell about the world beyond a tiny farm town. Got a 3 year jump on my classmates about being away from home, so wasn't a complete waste.
jz1a07,gdb268g,,Op, I'm sorry you're suffering and if I had any money I would send it your way seriously, but I have to ask: why would anyone in their right mind be homeless in key west? If that's just where you live before you were homeless, touche I understand. But San Francisco is literally the perfect place to be homeless. Florida is way too conservative of a place to be homeless. Even the supposed liberal parts of Florida govern in a very elitist neoliberal way  It really sucks how in these conservative areas homeless are treated like trash and cockroaches that infest areas. You are just a person period when you are homeless, the suffering is all over you and people are void of their humanity. It's so sad that someone in a suit looking disheveled would be aided right away yet someone looking much worse is treated like trash because of their perceived social class  Sorry, I'm getting into my leftist ranting now. I just hope to God that you're okay but I know you're most likely not and that just sucks. if anyone is reading this and has a little bit of money, try to have a heart and help her out with 50 bucks please. I have 20 bucks to my name and it's for my medication.  I'm so sorry you are going through this
jz79zc,gda6y7w,,Wait wait hold up let me get this straight you stole food from an Uber eats driver/rider that they left behind ?
jz79zc,,gda7wa6,They took it after the driver dropped it off. I'm almost certain.  I understand. I do. I wouldn't be sharing online.
jz79zc,,gda7r4y,In a apartment complex it was just siting there
jz79zc,,gda93tl,Ah okay.. I mean I‚Äôm glad you ate.. Anyone would have done the same if they were really hungry..but I would have knocked on someone‚Äôs door to double check.. hope you‚Äôre okay n get your next meal
jz79zc,,gda9e38,Am ok soup kitchen have been amazing in my area but 2 of the main kitchen have had people get covid so there not up and running at this moment witch is kinda scary because there are people that rally need these services
jz79zc,gdaeloc,,No, I found ways to get food otherwise. Pizza places throw out pizza at night. Coffee shops and donut places, ditto. If you hit them just after closing often they bag it up and toss it and it's still in wrappers even. Talk to people in food places around you. They may be glad to help you out rather than throw perfectly good food out. Also any food trucks around? The halal guys can be surprisingly good to homeless people. A couple of them used to feed me a couple of times a week.
jz79zc,,gdgkm6n,Mentioned this on another post.  7 Eleven throws out their hot food every hour.  Just ask the clerk if you can have it.
jz79zc,gdad01h,,Says a lot about the way things are going when a man gots to steal to eat. My pa and grandma told me lots of things that went on during the great depression of the 1930s. I am waiting and watching to see if more of the same keeps on happening now days. I think we just are about to see a modern Herbert Hoover type president. Or maybe we already did.
jz79zc,,gdadv67,The 30s were a lot more rural, and people learned different skills - like survival skills.   Nevertheless urban riots did happen.
jz79zc,,gs2jrbx,This mans was a pussy about it though. Too much of a coward to steal from a walmart and get some food decided to snatch it up because nobpdy was looking. Could have been some young mom doing good for herself and her kids and getting them a once in a blue moon treat that they all deserved.   If you are going to be a thief make sure you are taking from the rich corporations or obscenely rich assholes or else you are the piece of shit asshole.   This isnt the way things are going my friend this is a coward stealing because he is too scared and lazy to get his bread another more proper way
jz79zc,gdac8m8,,Well you were very hungry. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs okay, but you have no food. Try to find an alternative. Ask for money from people or ask restaurants or people for food.
jz79zc,gda6ruv,,i'll take food anytime. Survival is a human right.
jz79zc,,gda7y52,It was five guys and it was amazing
jz79zc,,gda8wrb,Consider it a poormans tax to uber and tax since those fucks won't pay taxes anyway or find loopholes
jz79zc,,gdah7u6,You should be banned from the vagabond sub.
jz79zc,,gdazp13,Because he expressed his opinion?
jz79zc,gddpou8,,You did it to survive the issue I would have is that it would be better to steal from a company then a individual. In this case the uber eats guy is probably gonna be the one who bought your meal
jz79zc,gdbjlkz,,Good for you don't feel guilty.  I'd always still from fry's whole food vons
jygask,gd3ymnv,,In bad weather, AM radio will allow you to listen to the static crash of lightning in the area. Closer together and louder, the storm is moving toward you. Quieter and further apart the storm is moving away from you.  There are some radios that pick up NOAA weather radio.

jygask,gd4oarl,,How about a blanket? Or sleeping bag?
jygask,gd5z17d,,This is a fantastic idea. Thanks.
jygask,gd53s1i,,[This](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Kaito-KA350-Solar-Crank-AM-FM-Shortwave-Weather-Radio-Green/372160912382?hash=item56a684dbfe:g:d9kAAOSwSHZWb1pc) is the radio I've had for the last five years. It was only $22 when I first bought it, but apparently the reputation has boosted its price and demand, I got it from Newegg as a replacement for [this](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Version-RunningSnail-Emergency-Flashlight/dp/B01MFCFKG5), which is, despite the price, a  fairly nice radio. The cranks still work on both, but the SW/Weather radio has twice the battery capacity and lasts days longer without a charge.    Edit. Both have been lifesavers if you live in a vehicle, saves me using my smartphone for background noise, and I still keep the Kaito in my backpack while at work or traveling out in the woods. Like a lot of complaints, you do need  a signal boost, they're small radios...I just made a device splicing conductive alligator clips to a dollar store USB1 cable and it picks up like a radio 3x more expensive. Now If I still lived in the South there wouldn't be much to listen to. Here in the West Coast there are lots of radio stations that make the time pass decently.
jygask,,gd8b0xs,Any chance you got a link on the antenna build?
jygask,gd3ovjl,,That's not a bad idea. Some phones have built in FM tuner, you only need the next radio app and headphones. When you open the app it'll let you know if your phone has a tuner or not.

jygask,gd70ceq,,.
jygask,,gd80fsn,Sorry
jygask,gd80aon,,Personally, I ditched the radio I had because it was too heavy to carry around for very little benefit.
jyqlvu,gd6dzup,,You aren't a minority. I'm from the Seattle area. You are not being discriminated against for being a straight, white female. I believe you might be having trouble getting shelter but it has nothing to do with your whiteness or being female or straight.   And yes, you are a bigot if you're running around talking about "gender deviants".
jyqlvu,gd75jo4,,For what it's worth. You being a Christian gal, this may mean more to you. My grandma raised 8 kids during the times of 1930s great depression. Her husband died shortly after the last child was born. She would say " When times seem bad, count your blessings ".  You got your health, how many do you see around you are sick. You got your mind right, there's a lot you see those suffering with big mental problems. You kept yourself from addictions,  all around are those possessed by drugs and booze. You are keeping your temple clean, not  forced to sell your body for the evil forces you see daily. Tho it may seem unfair, it rains upon both the just and the unjust. The favors that seem shown to the "wicked". remember Jesus worked his blessing on the worst people around, for those were the very ones that needed it most. Even if you gain very little on this earth, there's a mansion waiting for you.  Pretty sure you heard this as a child so maybe I'll just add a few prayers for you. God bless.
jyqlvu,gd9vggr,,I'm also a white, Christian woman but I don't know if I've been discriminated against because of that. I just thought all the programs and charities were equally ineffective, for everyone. I don't know what to say here but life sucks for anyone homeless, I guess some folks might get expedited but like I said, it sucks. For everyone.  I just want to say I'm sorry you're in this position, I know it's isolating but try not to look at it like this. Its not us vs them, we're all homeless and struggling.  Best of luck.
jyqlvu,,gda878i,In all honesty, the programs mentioned are largely ineffective, yes *dropped phone; edit  ... But your chances are much better depending on how badly you screwed up your life.   People don't understand that I just need to vent, and it's not about them. I'm allowed to grieve at times, but I don't go around "identifying" with it. But that's what this reddit is for.  It has no purpose if I am not allowed to do that.  Truly there is little grace in modernity.   Thank you for your well wishes.
jyqlvu,,gdag4zo,I know how frustrating things can be, especially in our situation, and while I think (honestly) you could have phrased some things differently, I assumed you were venting, hence I didn't want to call you out like the others  (I understand though why they did) I also understand wanting to just bitch, we've all been there.  I hear you on the programs, just signing up for EBT and Medicaid was pretty much all I could take, tired of hearing about waiting lists and whatnot. Sadly for my situation, its easier to panhandle (sadly, I'm one of those people you mentioned) when I really just want to get back to work, but it's tough because it seems I just don't have time for anything, but I'm ranting.  Again, I know how shit sucks and I'm really sorry, I hope things look up for you, dear.
jyqlvu,gd81ogq,,If I were to cut straight to the chase...by holding on to your "straight, white, christian" identity, you're aspiring out of your station. Most straight, white Christians have no problem looking down on vagrants such as yourself, just as they have no problem being rude to wait staff at restaurants on Sunday after church, knowing workers themselves can't afford to take the day off to be 'christian'. That includes these charitable organizations that make people recite incantations for a meal and a bunk like a trained seal. The nature of it is hierarchical and condescending.   You are living in classist cognitive dissonance.   Jesus may have been homeless, but he still came from royalty. Most Christians in the US are all about the royalty part.
jyqlvu,gd67v1l,,I hear ya. I'm having a difficult time too.
jyqlvu,,gd6cdsv,Thank you.  I hope something comes along for you. Best of luck.
jyqlvu,gd6evap,,If people tell you every day that you're a biggot then you must be doing something to lead them to that conclusion. This whole post reeks of self pity and thinly veiled racism. You are correct that there aren't programs designed to cater to white people. Mainly because white people aren't an undeserved population. Start looking inward and ask yourself some hard questions. You won't get shit in this world with that attitude.
jyqlvu,gd69dot,,Sorry for not being good enough or broken enough.  Life isn‚Äôt fair and neither are a lot of people.
jyqlvu,gd6himh,,These are just my honest feelings; they're actually pretty bland. Most of my emotions have been shut off.  I have zero resentments towards people who are recieving help I'd like, it's just that as a homeless person, every time someone has a reason to tell you "no" when you get up the nerve to even look, it just... does something to you.  If you don't care, or disagree, good for you. Most homeless people just rejected for housing or whatever are in a VERY bad state, so I do implore you to be kinder if you feel like you want to help, next time.   Because it's not about you.  I'm used to it. Doesn't bother me. But who knows what the heck happened to someone out here today. Or what they'll go through tomorrow.
jy8r9p,gd22e5h,,Socks
jy8r9p,gd3eon9,,Definitely check out the search function as this is asked at least once a week. People no longer answer because of this so the other posts may be more helpful.
jy8r9p,gd28nci,,With winter coming, definitely should look into blankets
jy8r9p,gd574aa,,Most towns, cities at least have some sort of organisation that helps the homeless and people in need. I‚Äôm also from the UK and the town over from me has one which you can volunteer at, helping to serve food / hand out essential items / have a chat with the people that come in. Not sure what part of the country you‚Äôre from but you could try googling or asking around to see what your area has to offer and see if they need any help. May not be exactly what you‚Äôre looking for but you‚Äôd be in direct contact with more homeless people than you see on the street and may be able to build up a friendship with some and see what it is they really want or need. Even just a friendly face and someone who actually cares can go a long way.   The place I‚Äôve helped out at also does a program that assigns you to an elderly person who you can befriend, they‚Äôre not homeless, may not even be in poverty but many are on their own and lonely, especially around Christmas time. (Have to have certain checks done first for this)   Churches may also be something to consider, you don‚Äôt have to be religious to find out what they do to help the homeless and for you to join in.   Other than that, I‚Äôd continue giving out hot drinks and if you could, source some blankets / sleeping bags, hats and socks they would come in handy especially this time of year. I‚Äôve found most people are happy enough with a hot drink and a conversation, the amount of people that look at the homeless like they are nothing and beneath them is appalling so when someone actually speaks to them like the human beings they are it really does make their day a little bit better or so I‚Äôve been told when I‚Äôve stopped to speak to anyone who seems to be homeless.

jxw3d5,gczwbkz,,Congratulations on the job friend! Frogg Toggs is a brand that I've used before. You can get a rain suit for like $30, I think they even have them at Walmart. To start I would maybe get a poncho and invest in rubber boots. Wet feet make life miserable when you're on them all day. Congratulations again though, that's awesome and an accomplishment! It's really hard to start crawling back up but the first leap into getting a job is the hardest. Way to go!!!!
jxw3d5,,gczwou9,Thanks. Your post brought a much needed smile to my face.  I'm very familiar with how hard it is to stay in a good mood when your feet are wet. Ill probably hit up bass pro shop.

jxw3d5,,gczcuc7,Applying for it is pretty easy. I'm not sure if I'll get it since I've already been denied once.

jxw3d5,,gd05gwl,ALSO look into a NED voucher (non-elderly disabled) if you haven‚Äôt already. Just need a doctor to sign off on some sort of disability. I had a client get it for severe social anxiety even though he didn‚Äôt qualify for SSI.
jxw3d5,,gd0582t,Former homeless case manager here. Talk to a disability lawyer if you‚Äôre denied again. Almost no one gets approved their first time. You‚Äôll get back paid to when they believe your disability started and the lawyers take a percentage of that as a fee, so no extra bills from the lawyers if you don‚Äôt get it.
jxw3d5,,gd05jbd,Thanks for the info. Pretty sure I'm going to get it as this year has been a literally nightmare in my brain. If not ill contact a lawyer.

jxw3d5,gd0cufh,,So, i dont know how being employed factors into your benafits... when i was on disability because of a damaged disk in my back if i had been employed or had any other income it would have dramatically reduced my benafits.   Id take the job over Disability honestly, your going to make more money, make connections, stay sane, amd occupy enuff of your time to keep yourself out of trouble.... youd also have an all clear for dumpster diving at work. I gaurentee walmart throws away a ton of food and other shit you could use. Some places like that even have showers. (Even if its a ghetto emergency chemical spill shower, holy fuck a hot shower is a hot shower) A couple pay periods of that and budgeting will put you in a place where you can rent a room.   I been there dude, and i just have to say: hard work pays off. Its hard when your just trying to survive, but a big step from surviving to thriving is a little hard work. Dont be afraid of it. Its good for you, pays, and builds charicter.   Cheers.

jxf383,,gcwx6t0,Awesome of you let that good karma save up may it help you as well when you need it may the universe bless you back for your generosity
jxf383,,gcxl5a3,Very nice of you. Sleeping bags are so crucial to us right now
jxf383,gcwmdqe,,So glad a fellow redditor reached out to help you.
jxf383,gcwe3e9,,Hey that's awesome! Also, totally unrelated but do you play PUBG? Because of your username.
jxf383,,gcwfda3,Yes i do. PUBG mobile these days obviously due to my homelessness but I played PUBG PC too.
jxf383,,gcwpvca,I'm on mobile too
jxf383,,gcwsnvu,What's ur ID? Mine is TARS1
jxf383,,gcy4q67,Can i hop on this? 20 n homeless too
jxf383,gcy4r97,,Reddit is beautiful
jx2mri,gctt48k,,I froze my fucking ass off last night. It got down into the 20s. I am not able to eat enough calories to generate the kind of body heat required to keep warm. But at least I don't have to deal with this kind of shit. I will build a fire, get more sleeping bags, move further south, do whatever I need to before I will stay at a shelter.
jx2mri,,gcu2g86, Yeah, shelters are wack!  It's been dipping into the low 20's where I'm at too.  I swear I'm developing serious back problems from curling up all night to sleep.  Like one of those old gnarly hunchbacked possums.
jx2mri,,gcvowyc,Go to Florida, Arizona, or California. All the other warm-weather states are hostile towards homeless people. Florida has humidity which sucks but they just passed a 15 dollar minimum wage hike. So any work down there even part time work Is going to pay good and your have more cash to buy stuff. Texas has a relatively good economy and housing Is really cheap in the smaller towns. But good luck getting set up there.   California has the basically perfect weather but really high coat of living. Offer lots of help but even if you get a 40 hour a week job, your not going to be able to get housing. So I would recommend Florida at this point.
jx2mri,,gcxlkyr,Just a heads up, that $15 minimum wage won't be hit til 2026. It's gonna go up gradually. I think its going up to $10 in Sept, and then another dollar every Sept til 2026.
jx2mri,,gcx8i13,I‚Äôve never stayed in a shelter and never would. Cardboard castle is just fine.
jx2mri,gcu8zf7,,Yeah man, my motto is: never leave my things behind, always keep my stuff with me at all times. I learned from hitchhiking.
jx2mri,gcubu26,,Hate to break it to you but as far as the shelter is concerned, the only ones you can trust are information brokers. People who tell you "If you want work, go here" or "This is where and when you can get clothing" and shit like that.  If anyone lies to you even one time, cut them off entirely. Never loan money, its a slippery slope.  Lastly, if a shelter is rumored to have no thieves, its ripe with theft.
jx2mri,gcvuh4g,,Thats the problem with most shelters... they don't offer a secure place for a person to keep their belongings. How the hell do people expect shelter residents to ever find work and move on with their lives, if they have to cart everything with them everywhere??
jx2mri,gcv6zt6,,This is why I avoid shelters like the plague...not to mention...we have one going on right now.
jx2mri,gcvzfqa,,Shelters need to provide secure storage/lockers. Clients shouldn't have to haul around everything they own in the world.
jx2mri,,gd4s63a,Now that would make to much sense. I think majority of this places are to steal finding in the name of helping the homeless. How many homeless actually get helped and how many get situated back in to life. Feeding and giving them a place to sleep, however great or not it may be, doesn‚Äôt help to get them on track with life. A person who gets derailed needs to get back on the tracks. Help them, to help themselves. A lot of money is being spent in the name of helping the homeless with no tangible result. That‚Äôs why this places mostly are black holes.
jx2mri,gcu71n3,,For what it's worth. I have concluded many of the people ( but not all ) that are in shelters stay there because: 1. No one else will put up with them 2. There are people looking for them not in a friendly way 3. Probably lack either  mental skills or physical skills to take care of themselves. Examples: addicts, thieves,  crazies ( not PC ), elderly waiting for nursing home, very small time dealers, and wanna bes.
jx2mri,gcuj4hb,,I'm really sorry this happened to you. Ask the shelter if they know of places that offer free clothes, and also ask if there are places that offer free storage lockers. Ask other shelters and service providers (like meal providers) for resources like that, too. Let whatever clothing closet you find know that your clothes were stolen, they might be willing to give you a couple extra items. You've probably heard the shelter advice to wear your shoes to bed, and to keep valuables in pockets you wear to bed, too. Maybe get a sleeping bag (ask around for places that have free ones) and keep your favorite clothes zipped up with you at night. Good luck, friend.
jx5qbj,gcw8tqy,,It does suck but you have a guaranteed spot.  Hang tight you are making great progress ! I live your updates
jxj408,gcx5urr,,I've eaten church to go lunches more then once and I was happy to get it and have a meal.
jxj408,,gcx9xfp,agreed, between hunger versus get treated like a kid for a few moment of your time and get a free meal.   I take the free meal and forget about the shitty stuff I had to go through for it.
jxj408,gcxild3,,For what it's worth. Instead of charity there is justice. This is justice " If you see a poor man take him into your house have him work for you and treat him as your brother "
jxj408,,gcyw9pt,Having done this on several occasions I can testify that it doesn't work out well very often.
jxj408,,gcyxoq7,Which part, having someone work for you, or you working for someone ? Either way it is a 2 way street, so if one fails to meet their end so be it, you tried.
jxj408,,gczqahe,Them working for me. Also giving them a place to stay to get on their feet in exchange for helping out.
jxj408,,gczql88,Don't feel bad,  I was repairing a old house and usually after one day I never saw them again.  27 people to find 2 workers.
jxj408,,gczs56q,Oh, I don't. And the one or two good ones are worth sifting through the rest.
jxj408,,gcxl8bs,THIS
jxj408,,gd09gt9,I'll be honest, I've opened up my house to maybe seven homeless people? All except one were so ungrateful and so comfortable asking me to buy them stuff, even flat out telling me to at times. It never lasted long.  A lot of times we have to remember that there's a reason why they can't go to their family to sleep for a month....  Not for everyone, but for most apparently. More than I wanted there to be.  And the lack of reasonable etiquette and self respect.  I had an entire fully furnished empty loft with a comfortable queen sized bed. This kid I let stay with me who was coming down off meth (and I mean he was coming down off a three month bender) decided to be laid out on my white $2000 couch from Ashley Furniture.... Finally I had to tell him to go upstairs.   The one person it did work out with, I fell in love with and we dated, and I wanted to fix her and she fucked me over time and time again, so you can say that didn't even work.  Another person who stayed there just laid around and did art all day and they clung to me. This was the son of a girl I knew in my town. I would be doing active things like mowing my lawn, driving to mow other people's lawns, going to the shooting range (back when I was okay with guns) and he pretty much clung to me and wanted to do everything around me. I'm a pretty firm guy and made it clear that I wouldn't have that though. And at the time he was staying with me, he was going through some sort of mental breakdown and he'd intermittently go from crying, to making odd requests, and finally I had to get him out of my house. Turns out the whole time he could have easily stayed at his grandfather's.  I suffer from depression, anxiety, PTSD, and autism, but I don't do well with people going through dissociative, or schizophrenic episodes when they become incoherent. I'm just bad at that. And I also have very firm boundaries and whenever I'm with a person like that they don't seem to respect them at all and it ends up putting me on edge.  Another thing, apparently before he stayed at my house, he was at someone else's house and he told the people there "I'm going to be staying at Richard's (me)"  I don't understand why we can't just open our doors to the homeless, they come in, and they're grateful that they're not sleeping in the rain and in return they be quiet, respectful, don't intrude in common areas, and maybe have the decency to leave during the day and come back later... I don't even mind if they want to stay at home all day, but at least hang out in your rooms.  This was also at a time where I kept bad company though. I was a bit too naive.
jxj408,,gd9rmuk,Unfortunately, there are some people who are like that, homeless and non homeless. Showing gratitude can really go a long way. But dont let the bad apples ruin it for the good ones. At the end of the day, everyone needs a shelter
jxj408,,gd3bq0o,There is an old saying about seperating the wheat from the chaff. You find out very quick which ones are grateful and which ones are grabby.
jxj408,gcx9rcq,,so.....what would in your opinion be a good solution?
jxj408,,gcxocwv,The fact that you have to ask this is proof of how much our culture has been socially conditioned  Housing them would be a GREAT and FINAL solution
jxj408,,gcy8b3v,[deleted]
jxj408,,gczajqg,Maybe if people stop acting like it's impossible to create an economic system based on something other than profit we could actually do something about housing.
jxj408,,gcya3gw,It has everything to do with social conditioning and you just proved that.  "Giving a sandwich with some snacks is the best that some organizations can do"  That's a lie. The governmnet spends $700B on the military a year.  If they just spent 698 billion and $2B went to the homeless, the problem would be eradicated.  It would be so easy to house every homeless person. Social norms as well as greed are the only reason why it hasn't happened.  All these organizations have the resources to stard a "Back on your feet" program to house, cloth, and feed someone while they get settled into a job. Every single one. It's not expensive at all to do. It's neo-con social norms that these people need to "Earn their own way and pull themselves up by the bootstraps"   But what about the people with mental disorders? They can just go fuck themselves right? Yeah, a bologna sandwich will fix that. It's impossible to assist anyone.  Your entire post here is a result of social conditioning. The world's biggest economy can't get 500,000 people the help they need? Don't be a fool.
jxj408,,gd0g3v7,Housing doesn't cure mental illness or addiction, though, and those are a huge liability when it comes to providing housing. Insuring and providing safe housing for everyone can be a big challenge when there is a lack of trust or willingness to obtain help from those who need to be homed.  Finding a working solution for that scenario would advance housing options leaps and bounds.
jxj408,,gd0hpnm,It can be done.  Yes, a lot of these people are fucked in the head and if you read my comments here I know first-hand from having them in my house.  Doesn't mean houses can't be built for them.
jxj408,,gd0lpb1,Housing can be built all day.  The biggest problem is that a lot of housing gets run down and destroyed fairly quick if there aren't interventions of some kind. Humane and compassionate enforcement of some kind of rules for cohabitation with neighbors is really tough when there is resistance. What solution do you see for that?
jxj408,,gd0n204,Non compliance gets you kicked out. There we go.  What other excuses are you gonna make to keep homeless on the streets?  Let me guess, you're not even homeless but a sandwich giver who pats themselves on the back  Go sleep outside for a week and then tell me if you still hold the same opinions.
jxj408,,gd6ilc1,That's a whole lot of assumptions you just made there. I don't remember saying anything about doing anything to anyone.  I asked you a question because you seem to have a lot of ideas, but when you're asked real questions about implementation you just demand houses. That isn't how the system works and you have to be able to work within it to get it to work for you.    I have slept a lot of places as have most people here. Let's get past the "you're not really this or that" bullshit and have a grown-up convo if we can.
jxj408,,gd0n6pq,Just as I thought. Not homeless. Easy for someone not sleeping outside to say how horrible of an idea to house the homeless ü§£
jxj408,,gd6iq3j,You only hear what you want to hear, not what anyone actually says.
jxj408,,gcyaurk,LOL in the offical homelessness subreddit, I get downvoted for suggesting the homeless be housed, and we're not a culture socially conditioned to be fiscally conservative? LOL GOOD ONE CHAP
jxj408,,gczaryd,I get down votes all the time in this sub for saying similar things. Sometimes it feels like this isn't a support sub for homeless people but a place for people who give out sandwiches to praise each other.
jxj408,,gczcowm,Best comment ever. Finally someone is on the same page as me.  Sometimes I think we should create a slang term to define these people. These sandwich givers who think they're changing the world when they are really doing so little that it's insulting.  what if you were out to dinner with a big group of people and the bill was $1,000 and you drop the penny on the table? Would they have the right to insult you? Call you cheap? Exclude you from their group?  Well this is just exactly how it feels when you are a full-grown adult who was a victim to poor circumstances and ended up being homeless and the church next to the car you sleep in invites people like you in every Sunday and when you walk in the door they are full of smiles and when they ask you how you are doing and you give them a morbid story describing such, they're only solution is that they will keep you in their prayers. Then they read scripture for an hour and then it's time for "dinner" where they give you a sandwich in a little baggie, fruit snacks, and a bag of cheez-its. They then continue to smile and tell you that if you pray enough you won't be homeless anymore. They also proceed to treat you like an animal and a criminal and will freak out if you accidentally walk into the wrong area of the church. They are like Rich racist white people who aren't used to being around minorities so when they move, these people get startled.  At that point they are doing so little that rather than take their shitty little sandwich I'd rather they sit their bitch asses down and write on a whiteboard 5,000 times "offering paper bag kindergarten lunches to homeless people is more self serving for me than it is helpful to them. I am an elitist who lacks empathy"  Or even better, they can stop giving out sandwiches completely and offer their services for one week. Yeah, if they want to help homeless people instead of volunteering their time every Sunday they can just volunteer one week and then never do anything again. I say this on behalf of homeless people. Okay so here is how this week will be spent. They will begin Monday morning in a public baseball field with a dugout . They will be given one sleeping bag. any credit cards, cash, or currency of any kind will be confiscated and returned the following monday. In order to fend for themselves, they will have to get creative or just "get a job" but they are starting with nothing so now they will know how that feels. They will also be given a new phone and not be allowed to call any friends or family. They will experience how it feels to be completely homeless and will not be able to call a family member to buy them lunch.  I would pay to watch one of these arrogant elitist sandwich givers be homeless for one week. I'm sure after one night they would have an emotional breakdown.  Remember that winter when your dog had to go out in the middle of the night and you open the door and it was 10¬∞ out and you quickly shut it? Have fun sleeping in that.  That's how I feel we ought to treat politics and social issues. Every Congress person should have to spend one week in jail for they sign off on any criminal justice legislation. Cops should experience the feeling of being arrested. And not being warned before. Just let them know that at a random time this year they will be arrested so they know how it feels to be driving your car one day and to be pulled over and basically kidnapped by the police because you forgot to renew your license and it got suspended unbeknownst to you. Because yes, that's actually an arrestable offense.  These people who are in authority of the lives of the less fortunate need to live a week in their shoes
jxj408,,gd0ykso,Great comment, I‚Äôm curious, saw on another post you may be in Dallas... can you give a clue which church? Though I‚Äôm sure most are like that, unfortunately ... most of them (me included), should focus on what Jesus said, literally.
jxj408,,gd6kr28,As far as the church It starts with O and and ends with G. And it's not actually a church but a private charity/social services organization.
jxj408,,gczed50,You two should start a sub called Sandwich Givers , Id love to hear the discussions and solutions .
jxj408,,gczodse,Solution is simple:  If you want to help, give them shelter or actual resources  If someone had a broken limb and was sceaming at the top of their lungs, do you not think it'd be a dick move to walk over to them and say "oh yeah....mmm that sucks =/ well! I will elect to be Charitable to improve this problem. I hereby donate to you ONE BAND-AID."  Screaming Brokened Limb Person: I DONT WANT A BAND-AID I WANT SOME HELP OMG AAAAAHHHH  sandwich giving asshole: ..... üò° Be grateful you got anything. If you want some help, pick yourself up by the bootstraps. No one is going to heal your broken leg for you. You're responsible for yourself
jxj408,,gczp2wx,Not sure if you realize I agree with your points . It seems like you are directing anger at the wrong person .
jxj408,,gcyd4xb,this has nothing to do with your proposed theory of 'social conditioning'. the commenter was simply asking a perfectly reasonable the astronomical budget for the military it's a result of corporate lobbying and general corruption. it has almost nothing to do with the average people in this country and their daily lives.
jxj408,,gd27z2l,[deleted]
jxj408,,gd58xup,Keyboard warrior...try again. I broadcast, write, and have LIVE debates regularly. And whenever comment section debates get heated or passionate, I invite everyone to come on zoom to debate me. To this day, no one has. So who's the fucking keyboard warrior....
jxj408,,gcyenzz,You're misunderstanding the point completely.  I'm saying the governemnt has the ability to radicate homelessness...
jxj408,,gcyf2tq,the government has the ability to do a lot of shit. We could be damn near a utopia in 10 years if we had perfect leadership and smart citizens. social engineering in particular is irrelevant to the military budget, because people aren't the ones who decide it.   just saying that everyone has been socially engineered because you believe a particular issue has a better solution that's ignored, is something you could say about nearly every single thing.
jxj408,,gcyhi9g,That's why I clearly distinguished the two
jxj408,,gcyhngw,what solution would you have for smaller charities? rather than giving foods?
jxj408,,gcyok2v,yes but Housing cost serious money, somebody HAS to pay. From the land to the buildings as well as all the utilities.   Who gonna fund it? You?   you know that Shit like that don't come free and even if it does there's some serious conditions that come with it.
jxj408,,gcz3gcg,the military capability of being able to obliterate the entire species by the push of a few buttons costs serious money. But we pay that.  in simulations where the USA is in a military conflict with EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH, the USA still wins. With NATO, we will NEVER need to use our military to the fullest extent, LITERALLY EVER.  Yet we spend 700B, the runner up is China and they spend just shy of 200B. We are more than twice the size of the second biggest. And we keep raising the budget.  That's serious money and it's a fucking waste, dude. There's 500,000 homeless people. They can cut the military budget by 2B, which would only be 2/700ths of the enitre budget, and allocate that money every year to fight homelessness and the problem would then be non existent.  Also, how the fuck does Denmark eradicate homelessness? How does Finland do it? We're the biggest economy in the globe.   Bro. You're literally raising my blood pressure here. It physically hurts me to see people this closed off to reality, because they've been lied to for so long.  Please understand that the existing rhetoric on socioeconomic policy is very corporate based. They say these platitudes with NO representation from the homeless and the working poor. And they speak these platitudes so much and so long that it becomes engrained into the people initially. And then those people raise their children with those values. And now when they've indoctrinated one generation to think the way they want them to, now they can just watch since they've literally changed people's fundamental values which they'll pass onto their kids.  These platitudes are TRASH. We have the capability to eradicate all of the suffering in the US. The money is there. The problem is a few greedy people hoard money that they will never touch. They and they alone are the reasons for this nation's suffering.
jxj408,,gd5hb9m,That military budget is the reason you're not speaking German or japanese. That military budget is why you're able to sit here complaining about a first world problem. That military budget is the reason why you have rights. That military budget is why you were able to be homeless in the first place. That military budget is the only thing protecting your cynical condescending ass from a Chinese warhead. You sit here and complain about "sandwiches in a dalas church" while children in china are sewing together a pair of nikes that you'll be wearing this time next year. You're a foolish little marxist who has no concept of the cost of freedom, let alone the integrity to acknowledge your own personal resonances. #patheticchild
jxj408,,gd5hoqz,Didn't read any of that. Like I've said four fucking times now, debate me on zoom or you're just a coward.
jxj408,,gd88my7,Says the coward who got "bailed out of homelessness by a private individual"? What's the matter? Couldn't take the small sandwiches so you begged someone?
jxj408,,gd8kcti,Recieving help is not cowardly lol and no, I didn't need to beg. I asked once and they came through... but hey guess what? Hiding behind a keyboard is cowardly ;)  Come on Zoom and debate, bitch. I'm starting to think you're a repressed 14 year old who's going through his conservative phase LOL
jxj408,,gdbyqvd,Are you seriously telling a homeless man on reddit to come on zoom and debate you over a small sandwich? You reek of desperation for attention.
jxj408,,gczdjj1,yeah perhaps, but regardless no matter how much you can bitch about it, nothing ever gonna change.   neither you or me will ever touch even 1cent of that 700B in our lifetime. War is a business, it continues to run even when there's no war, and USA goverment is the world forehead in the war business.   So here's a thought, how about you start a charity organization of your own just to see how much it cost to run such thing, then talk about solving the homeless problem. So until then, us plebeians will simply have to content ourselves with the free meal, it be demeaning but free is free, and when you're hungry shit like that ain't too unbearable.   I can tell you that apartment buildings sometimes throw out perfectly intact furniture that woulda cost $$$$ if brought new.  I can tell you that shipping warehouses throw out wooden pallets that one could use to build a shed/home out of.    Those free meal ain't bad really, some of it have to be eaten asap but the rest of it can be save to keep most of us from starving the next day or the next week.    If you truly want to solve the homeless problem, simple enough......find a piece of land, and build it up as a homeless housing project, that is....providing you can get someone to fund you and I guarantee you that nobody will, not the churches, not the charities, certainly not the government either.   a person can live in relatively comfort within 1 car parking spot which is roughly nine feet¬†wide¬†and eighteen feet¬†long. a 3 stories parking lot building can houses between 50-150 occupants if all you put in is the wall to separate the living spot and communal toilet/bath.   but good luck finding someone to help you to do that, I've tried, 36 of those organizations, and all of them respond with "How much can you pay?"   and I know at least 6 of those organizations have the money to buy and build a brand new church.
jxj408,,gczms4l,You'd be one of those people on the slave ships during the Atlantic slave trade telling your buddies "it's always going to be this way, nothing we can do about it. Hey, if you want to be free, then just offer the master a million dollars to buy your freedom. Until then , shut up and stop bitching"  It's people like you that I can't stand the most. You are more insufferable than any corporation. Because you lick their boots without getting anything in return. You've proven to be weak-minded by accepting that their oppression "is what it is"  I got news for you buddy. Things are going to change. And they are going to change because of the people like me who refuse to stand for oppression. And if everyone in the world were like you, oppression would continue on. Because that's what you settle for.
jxj408,,gczb9zj,Housing doesn't have to cost serious money. That's yet another manufactured crisis created to funnel profits.
jxj408,,gczduao,it does if the place you're at is a populated area, for example in California here, a piece of land goes up to a cool million.  the cheapest, most run down house with maybe 1 bedroom you can find can only go so low as 500k.
jxj408,,gcze88d,Capitalism is a human construct. Capitalism is why land is split up and given to individuals as property. Capitalism is why housing is a profit driven industry. Absolutely none of that is unchangeable.
jxj408,gcxlszs,,Am not even going to try but your mindset is horrible and I would not be  Surprise if that's the reason why you're still in the predicament you are in And if you want to complain about a sandwich don't eat it go hungry  People don't owe you anything Whatever the reason your in the situation nobody has to get you out of it but yourself  if I was serving at that church  I will tell you to get your attitude and yourself to hit the road
jxj408,,gczbmyd,I know people grateful as fuck for whatever they're given yet they've been homeless for years, sometimes decades. Stop expecting other homeless or formerly homeless people to make themselves subservient just because you personally don't mind being that way.
jxj408,,gcxos60,Also I'm one of the ones serving at that organization. I'm not homeless  And this is MY opinion. These people are in terrible situations and the employees of the organization almost have some kind of complex over these people and love treating them like trash. Oh but here's your shitty lunch
jxj408,,gcxomw8,You clearly can't read since I clearly specified that I'm formerly homeless and currently housed.  But wow, you're kind of a piece of shit for trying to shove someone's situation in their face for trying to improve conditions for homeless people.  Youve been socially engineered by Republicans and Neoliberals who say that homelessness is the result of not picking yourself up by the bootstraps.
jxj408,,gd5344q,1st off what is republicans have to do with anything Secondly your attitude Is the reason why homeless people get a bad rap And not shoving in anyone's face But it's true if you want something it's worth working for nothing is guaranteed in life and the fact that your complaining about somebody giving you a sandwichIf it were up to me I would just tell you to take your shit and starve And secondly I know somebody who has gone 18 days without eating due to discriminationI think that person would a loved a sandwich Yes homelessness is not a choice but getting out of it isIn just a fact that your mindset thanks that your entitled to somethingIs the whole reason you probably were homeless to begin with    And lastly you've been socially engineered by democrats to have a victim mentality a victim ideology that everything is not your fault that the world did it to you  That the world owes you something that these programs suggest help you out of something that you probably did to yourself But I would love to have this debate
jxj408,,gd56vks,"your attitude is the reason why homeless people get a bad rap"  You clearly read just the first two lines because as I've had to clarify ten fucking times now, I'm not even homeless...I'm a volunteer and community activist who is disgusted by how little is done for these people.  I also haven't been socially engineered by democrats because I'm not a fucking democrat.  Also, four entries on a two day old post within a short window, I know you guys came from a right wing sub and want to spew your ideas. Unfortunately, you caught me at a bad fucking time and I'm in a bad fucking mood.  You want to debate with me about why you're a fiscal conservaitve, get on a zoom call with me and we'll debate.
jxj408,,gd58dbn,If you care so much, go out and feed them yourself. Better yet, go give every homeless person you see 20$ so they can go buy a meal themselves.  More than likely, that money won't go to a "sandwich" If you're here simply to complain about an organization that you're dissatisfied with in how they go about helping. Then volunteer somewhere else.
jxj408,,gd59v4h,If you're really homeless and living in a tent, yet you disagree with my sentiment that the homeless need to be provided with more resources, you're a fucking dumbass and let's see how differently you feel in a year when you're still in the same position which is very likely. I hope you aren't but here's a good chance you're not getting out of this without someone bailing you out.  Also, if you knew anything about me you'd know I've opened up my home to these homeless people. Not doing that again because I can't risk having to replace all my carpets again. I'd rather give them each 50 bucks a week. Which I've done as well.  If the government just gave them 2 billion, a poor guy like myself wouldn't feel the need to give them money and it's a SAD state of affairs that private cirizens help more than the government.  oh, that's not supposed to happen? look at norway. look at canada. look at the uk. why is okay for them but it's evil socialism in america? you're the fucking brainwashed one, stfu.
jxj408,,gd57cb4,If what you say is true and you'd really love to have this debate, let's schedule a time to get on zoom.  Also, I think it's pretty pathetic to want to debate someone you feel is homeless.  Homeless peopple have serious issues. That reminds me of what Steven Crowder does. Picks weak positioned people to "debate" them and then shotgun augments talking points at them and then declares that he won.  Clearly too much Steven Crowder.  Let's have a debate, but you're not debating a homeless person, you're debating a writer and a broadcaster. We stick to just the facts. We take turns talking. No personal insults, just debate.  And yes, I know I had some personal insults in here but you caught me at the bad time for this BS
jxj408,,gd53mlq,No I don't think homeless people deserve more than just a sandwich I believe homeless people deserve an opportunity to work and better the community you start giving every homeless person hand out there never going to work for anything there going to be lazy and titled and complacent And considering how covid  going and people dying due to it people should just be thankful
jxj408,,gd56ehp,Dumbass....  If it was as easy as "pull your bootstraps up and get a job" then they'd do it.  Why do so many non homeless sandwich giving elitists come on here? Stay home in your gated communities, no one cares about your shitty sandwich. Give them ten bucks and let them buy their own sandwich.  Watch Admin Ruins Everything episode of homelessness...Adam tends to be liberally biased but everything in that shoe is pure fact.
jxj408,,gd58lto,See if you new anything about me I don't live in a gated community I am actually home with myself living in A-tent working my way out of homelessness and being grateful for every sandwich that I get
jxj408,gd55b72,,How did you get out of homelessness did you have an organisation help out what was the reason you were in the position to begin with was it  a drug problem was it you fell on hard times At the end of the day yeah you can say you want universal housing but people have problems that put him out to the streets to begin with universal housing is not gonna help it's just gonna put a band-aid on it Also the government doesn't oh you anything Why people have a job so they can obtain housing  themselves  Where do you think the government money comes from to support these charities Or nonprofits Taxpayers they come from people that have paid into the system their whole life    Just so people have the option to be lazy in other countries homelessness is not allowed why do you think the Taxpayers owe you housing or any kind of assistance
jxj408,,gd564v3,I debunked every retarded thing you just said in this very post. I'm not repeating myself. You've clearly been socially coniditioned to think that in 2020, with all of our technological advancements that somehow it's impossible to house half a million people. Go ahead and believe that.
jxj408,gd59uah,,Wow. What a sanctimonious prick. You done virtue signalling and shilling?
jxj408,gcxz14c,,I'm sorry M'Lord, what would you have your servants do for your majesty? I know they have tried and failed to live up to your standards. Maybe next time the people will realize his grace deserves so much more and just give him their entire coin purse.
jxj408,,gcxz465,Not even fucking homeless. Read the post dumbass.
jxj408,gcxp6jp,,Some of these replies are just proof of how socially conditioned our culture is. Homeless people themselves saying that my attitude is horrible and people should just be grateful. Even though I'm not homeless, but just trying to improve conditions to those who are.   Stop falling victim to neoliberal talking points. These people are doing nothing for you.
jxj408,gd5evrk,,What's that old saying? Oh yeah... Buy a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he'll eat for the rest of his life. The opportunities to learn a good work ethic and strive to build oneself a better life is something that all homeless should be given. Opportunities to learn the value of hard work and a day's pay. In the circle of life, everyone is hungry, but few are willing to hunt for food. Scavenging does nothing but foster poor ethics. Hunting teaches one to be grateful for their efforts. Nobody is entitled to a free meal, everyone is entitled the opportunity to work for it. You say in your op that you are/were formerly homeless. In another discussion/post you claim to suffer from mental illness/dissability. Ironically the programs that helped you out of homelessness more than likely did so only because of your mental health diagnosis. Pragmatically you seem to be under the impression that "more can be done" while you benefited from a "one solution fits all" system. Let me break this down for you. Tax write-offs, which are utilized by company's and nonprofits to ensure their bottom dollar and takeaway are why you got helped. These write-offs are why homeless with addiction, mental health or independents(kids) get helped almost emediately. But I digress, if someone doesn't fall into these brackets, that "one solution fits all" system normally ends up failing. Misserably. This system fails in this way in order to push otherwise normal people who fell on hard times even further towards desperation. (Like those who lost their jobs or those with an eviction) Normally, those pushed to desperation turn to substance abuse, crime, or other questionable behaviors which in turn leads them back to those non profits who seek to benefit from those lovely "tax write-offs" and other "programs". You are no longer homeless because someone saw your eligibility to make them money. However, most homeless just want the handouts. No society has ever benefited from a larger proportion of parasites living off of those who support it. If people aren't willing to work, they aren't valued. This leads me to explain to you this: People aren't willing to help the homeless when the homeless won't help themselves. People will shun away from others who refuse to put any work into bettering society. Which is why "half assed charitable organizations" are so half assed. Charity only goes so far when nobody is giving back to charity. When a majority of the homeless will throw away a coat they just got, simply because they don't want to carry it. People aren't too willing to keep giving an ungrateful person more coats. You benefit from your own ignorance and whomever helped you out of homelessness, benefited more. Either due to your own self admitted mental health issues or your own unwillingness to comprehend how the systems in society work. You cannot be so sanctimonious while simultaneously not comprehending that not everybody is so keen to want to jump and help save the world.
jxj408,,gd5fius,Wow, thakns for that point of view. I've never thought of it that way :)  Kidding, nice neo-con empty platitudes. Mitt Romney would be proud. You should run for office. You clearly have a nack for talking and talking and not saying a damn thing.  I'm not debunking your BS neo con talking points on here, You want to debate me on homeless and other socioeconomic issues, let's get on Zoom. Face to face, man to man, debate the facts. I'm not getting in an essay war with you.
jxj408,,gd5gg6r,I've also reported this post. Do not make fun of a person for admitting they have PTSD and the depression and anxiety that stem from it by calling them "self admitted mental health issues": and furthermore don't make the assumption that someone benefited from a tax write off when I got bailed out of homelessness. Because they didn't since it was a private individual.  &#x200B;  When you have to make personal jabs at someone, you've lost the argument and I reject your hypothesis completely.   &#x200B;  Now you have to come on zoom with me and look me in the eyes or you're just a coward.  &#x200B;  When you debate, stick to your opinions. Don't try and break the other person down like a coward.
jxj408,,gd5j1rh,LoL  Firstly, I didn't "make fun of you" at all, I simply repeated what you already admitted about your self. If I had "made fun" of you, I would have cannotated a snide or condescending tone or remark and put you down. I simply stated a standard regarding the systems of society. Of which, you are clearly disasociated with in your privileged life.  Case and point: So... Wait a minute. You got "bailed out of homelessness by a private individual" and you're telling me that I've lost an argument? That explains why you can sit there and confidently say that you "reject your (my) hypothesis". This would work, if what I had stated were even a hypothesis. It wasn't, no kiddo. I stated how the system works. I stated what happens and why. You just don't like it. You're an even bigger hypocrite than I could've imagined. You can try to deny reality all you like, but it does not detract from the truth.  And, I don't have to do anything on "zoom" with you. I'm not a coward, I don't jump when privileged sanctimonious wits like yourself say how high. Just because you're offended, doesn't mean you are correct.
jxj408,gd0bmvj,,Two words: eminent domain. With the surplus of unoccupied housing currently owned by Big Banking, every homeless person in America could be housed, and there would still be homes left over.  The government uses it all the time to push its projects through. The only reason it doesn't do this to fix homelessnes is because Big Banking is happily balls deep in Big Government's ass.   Why? Because the Old White Pervs who own Big Banking also own the Old White Pervs who make up Big Government.  Until the OWPs in Big Government are voted out and replaced by people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Andrew Yang, and others like them, it's not going to improve. Same goes for health care and higher education.   The system was built on oppression, but it *can* be changed. Except people are afraid of change and resist it until it's forced upon them.... Revolutionary France comes to mind.  I just hope we don't have to pull out the guillotine if we can avoid it. All those bodily fluids...
jxj408,gcxpdr8,,I get it man, people could do a lot more for homeless person, that's true.   But at the same time, people are afraid of homeless people for many reasons.lots of visibly homeless are agro, and dangerous. I don't stay at shelters because of the insanity there, and I wouldn't invite most of those people to live with me because they're genuinely crazy.   If someone is normal, and not aggressive, (and I had a home), yeah they could stay with me for like 3 months for free. But angry people, no thank you.   Do you let homeless people live with you for free??

You‚Äôre a good person who has been told not to take what isn‚Äôt yours. Even that core part of you is going to take a hit over this. It‚Äôs okay. Good people have feelings when they get here. You are still a good person. Wal-Mart is like bad people; they don‚Äôt feel bad when they steal. When I had to steal food, I‚Äôd go into the same store when I got some money, buy two of whatever and leave one behind when I left. Depending on the checker, I‚Äôd sometimes say: ‚ÄúThis is for the one I stole last week.‚Äù and leave it at the checkout stand.
jwktjv,gcr0ywe,,You didn't hurt anyone but wal-mart's shareholders. Honestly FUCK them, and fuck Wall street in general. People getting free money from other's hard work is why there's so much poverty and homelessness in the first place.
jwktjv,,gcrozub,Walmart's shareholders are perfectly insulated from stranger danger.   The vast majority of all theft is financial embezzlement.   The vast majority of product theft is perpetrated by employees.   The vast majority of customer theft are items stolen by house wives to pad their weekly food budget.   For homeless people to increase the shrinkage rate by even a single percentage point (which is well within predicted fluctuations anyway) every single homeless person would have to steal ten thousand times the product value they currently steal.   Don't steal from a local business, or a co-op. Shit, I don't even steal from WinCo. Even highly franchised businesses like Muji or Sephora are on my nogo list because the franchisee's are barely less enslaved than their employees and as a homeless person I was always more free than the McOwner.  But, we gotta stop perpetuating the myth that our thefts having any tangible impact on make retailers anywhere.

jwktjv,gcrn5lk,,Literally the only guilt you should ever have about stealing from Walmart is the fact that their shrinkage insurance is so comprehensive that they make extra money if you steal sale items. I'm fact, you should feel more guilt for buying clearance items than stealing them, as Walmart gets significantly less money for it.   There's an optics issue, like, stores will judge other homeless people if you steal obviously or aggressively. So, maybe don't do that? But as someone who was always a prime suspect, I forgive you and encourage your sense of survival.   Your life matters more than anyone's bottom line.

jwktjv,gcr1ca2,,You haven't stolen from another human being nor an animal; rather, you've stolen from a very large, very wealthy, very massive corporation. The scale between the two is completely different. No, don't steal from a local shop, as you're stealing directly from the mouths of others. But consider that this is Walmart and that you need to live. Consider the amount of time and effort they take from their employees in exchange for very little and suddenly there isn't too much to be upset about.  You should feel like an absolute piece of shit stealing from another being. But a company with so much money they have no idea where to put most of it? Nah. This is coming from someone with a very high moral ground, but with an eye to actual reality.
jwktjv,gcr7mga,,1. Walmart has insurance for things like this.  2. You should feel terrible about this, its how you know you're still human,.  3. A windbreaker will do something, and something is better than nothing. Stick newspaper, other clothing, etc inside of the windbreaker.

jwr6rx,,gcsblj4,The stereotype that everyone who is homeless must be a drug addict prevents those who need a hand up from getting the help they need.  It makes no sense why they would give this much money to someone who is housed while bypassing those who truly need it.

jwr6rx,,gcsbw0w,It does but unless you have covid, a victim of domestic violence, etc you don't qualify.   See that is the scam. To get the rental money you just need a lease. But to qualify for a motel room you have to be in a special protected class.

jwlpn0,gcqwnvm,,We want to find a way for the homeless to get into the habit of creating value, because that is the only force in a person's life that can change them from the current condition.  The ones who still have some dreams and goals need to realize they may not realize such by staying homeless.  They need to be willing to build social capital with others. Social capital means lasting relationships where there is trust based on experience.    These plans would pay for themselves quickly because there are easy to create and maintain job ideas for people who may have challenges and whose competence is not currently very high.   One main economic rehabilitation strategy is planting valuable plants in people's yards.  A yard can propagates about $500 to $1000 in plants every year pretty much automatically.  What's left is a good workout for about an half hour a day, or a few hours a week. There are many examples of perennial plants that have value, are hardy, and are cheap to install.    There are other low skill jobs that could be one in 2-4 hours, which is the time I think is best suited for the homeless to work.  They would not get worried about what might be required in a longer time slot and since many of the homeless are not in good health, they would be able to do something short like this.   Various projects like creating search engine rankings for websites, teaching others skills like people who are older who do not know how to use smart phones or computers, and so on.
jwlpn0,gcv0yfv,,November 19, 2020 The Start of an Economic Revolution  We do not need to depend on government to improve our financial lot.  We need to be able to form groups of trustworthy people.  Such was the start of every successful major large business.  Many businesses started with enough money but were not successful.  The money was not spent intelligently on payroll, but on foolish purchases.   The book "The Go Giver" is a fictionalized account of how using generosity is profitable.  The idea of social capital is also crucial to form trustworthy relationships that can get people out of the mistrust that "the system" seems to have created.  I am not looking for anything for publishing this.  I look at it as a work of concept art.  These were written in 2009 but it just so happens there are 19 of them, the date this manifesto is published.  There were never written in anything more than a rough-draft form, although published in various places online since 2009.  New Economy from Nineteen New Educational Principles  Concepts for Economic Empowerment  1. We need to focus on educating each other. Adult education is actually where the biggest change can come which can prevent disaster. Unfortunately, television is what has been educating most people in the last several years, and it has only gotten worse and worse in many ways. These forces have combined with popular music, and have created much culture without any wisdom or beauty. 2. We need to see people as "asleep" instead of evil. If we see them as merely asleep to what bad they are doing when they harm others, even economically, then they may have a chance to be educated towards a possibility for change. 3. Not appreciating all that one has, puts things in a state of entropy, and then these things lose their value. One has to always "polish" what one has, take care of what one has, organize one's belongings, or things lose their potential. 4. Not seeing the service aspect of working, and not putting into full practice the idea that we have to give before we can get. This creates a "vacuum" and the universe abhors a vacuum and seeks to fill it. If we carefully create the right service or value, wealth can flow in. If we do not create any true vacuum of service or value, nothing will flow in. 5. Aim to end planned obsolescence, and by doing so boost American or any other country's economy. If we could outlaw the sale of cheap products that are sold without warranty, we would create a new industry in America of making high-quality goods. Cheap products are essentially, or eventually, worthless. If there was legislation that one could not sell a product without a minimum three year warranty, this would be considered a green law, since products that soon turn to garbage would end up in landfills. We could build new small industries in the U.S. or other countries. Think of what this would do to the U.S. morale, or the morale of any other country. 6. We have to partially get out of the "specialization" field. Most of us have a vested interest in the modern world to be "seen as a specialist" and charge fees based on that. In some, way, shape or form, virtually everyone's resume reflects this, from a dishwasher to a airplane pilot. However, that has no longer allowed most of us to have the money, leisure, or other standards of living which we want to live. 7. Buy from those who will buy from you. For example, many ethnic groups in the United States empower each other by forming economic networks in which each person does a different type of business and they all buy from each other. This prevents money going outside the network into anonymous large corporations. 8. Befriend and humanize by repeated consistent and loving effort, all the bureaucracies. Even bureaucracies are composed of people who have backroom office talk and talk there just as normally as everyone else. The bureaucracy is the face that they have to show to the public. Don't say, that they have to show that face to keep that job. That is determining the future based on imagination. A major principle in mind to keep is that any organization can be in danger of acting like a big bureaucracy. 9. Things only blossom if there is enough knowledge to fertilize these new things. We will not as easily shift into alternate energies, unless there is a threshold of people who understand these new technologies, or understand the marketplace aspects of them. This is one important part of public energy. Already, the solar sector in the U.S. has shown huge profits and Europe is far, far ahead of the United States. 10. The energy problem affects us more than just at the gas pump or paying the electric bill. For instance, in 2008, those in the United States who sold on eBay could no longer ship things surface rate in international shipping. This reduced their sales by a substantial amount, especially if there were wealthier people in other countries who may not be as affected by a recession. This truly would have a trickle down effect, if those sellers would have more money. 11. Many new jobs only need be responsible for creating value, because a system of barter has already worked in many economies. Think of senior homes/low income home improvements. Seniors could help with baby sitting as younger parents could help with home repair. 12. Not connecting to the greater sources of money (corporations, high paying clients) for some of our business sales, and instead focusing on the general public. The general public's eyes are owned by big media and big corporations. It is very hard to sell a new product no matter how valuable and good it is. We have to see where we can use these big groups, and where they are using us. 13. We are always wealthier if we do what we are able to do in our own part. If we have excuses that involve other people, that someone should do for us what we can do for ourselves, that somehow we were the victim of someone else, then we are always playing the child or victim role and things cannot improve. 14. We should be focusing on "creating value" not only "earning money." For example, imagine digging up some of one's lawn area and preparing the area for a nut and fruit tree orchards and other gardening area. This will create a substantial amount of "wealth" each year for one's household without having to bring in more money to buy things. There are many such improvements one can make and even invent for other people. There are low income but ready now electric car conversions that people have done for virtually every make of car. 15. Corporations and large institutions like governments, universities, hospitals and so on, are the part of the world that has the money, and that is where we can focus on professionally. If we focus on selling to the smaller business community, there may not be as much money. It is also harder to reach a large amount of the general public today as bigger corporations have the main eye of the public due to advertising money. 16. One can do philanthropy without any money by focusing on educating other adults. One can do this online by going into areas such as social networking, traffic exchanges, safelists, toplists, webrings, and so on. This circulation of knowledge is free and also stress free. 17. Networking, and creating work collectives to achieve a common purpose, is a great idea, and no one can call such small groups derogatory names in a free market capitalist system. It is hard to network with the "general public" in America today, but if you focus on networking with your interest groups, you can more easily find people that you can form some kind of lasting connection with. For instance, groups that like to be together are musicians, people who like fishing, antique, coin or any kind of collector, seniors, teenagers, and so on. 18. We need to see our romantic partnerships as "creating new families" where even two people are a family. Then these two people are for each other, operating as a team, two heads can are better than one, and two can live as cheaply as one, and if they are both employed, they can be more wealthy. The media marketplace tends to only be able to show the romantic aspect, and condition people to believe in imaginary aspects of human perfection. Whether or not there is a planned marketing plan to try to get people to think independently or not is irrelevant, especially if we take the position that people are asleep to the harm they do to others and ultimately to themselves. 19. Need to remember all the high paying work we have done successfully If we are continuously looking at self-help material instead of focusing on and doing our work, then how can we provide any value in the community?
jwb4m5,gcp4u26,,Oh, jeez.  That hurts to look at.....  A dentist or dental school would be best but I do understand it's not an option right now.  Poor man's approach:  Gauze wrapped around your fingers.  Maybe ice chips - if you can tolerate them - to numb your mouth somewhat.  Aspirin or Tylenol for the pain.
jwb4m5,,gcp51ta,I'm kinda taking the cave man approach. I read online that you can wiggle teeth a lot to make it easier to get out but I wasn't ready for so much blood.
jwb4m5,,gcp5giv,"Cave man approach" - lol.  If it works.....  I can see from the photo that your tooth was in bad shape.  You're not kidding about the size of the cavity.  Not sure about the blood.  Rinse your mouth out with water lots?  I think someone suggested some type of salt water solution (?) but that seems like it would hurt more?  Perhaps you should post in r/medical for advice as to what to do.  There might be a dental sub-reddit as well but I don't know - I'll check.  They might have better ideas for the pain and the bleeding.  EDIT:   https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/
jwb4m5,,gcp5nkc,Oh yeah I cleaned up the blood lol. I don't want to get banned for it being too gorey. And I have a cloth in my gums so it doesn't bleed anymore
jwb4m5,,gcp62as,The r/dentistry sub-reddit seems to be the one to look at.  Maybe they can at least point you in the direction of a helpful dentist?    You shouldn't have to be doing your own dental extractions.  I gotta say, I couldn't do that....I'd pass out from the pain.
jwb4m5,,gcp6b19,Yeah I pretty much have passed out a few times. Mostly during the wiggle part. Once I get it loose enough I can just grab it and pull but my god the pain is horrible.
jwb4m5,,gcp6ygi,Do you at least have Tylenol or something for the pain?
jwb4m5,,gcp70fc,Some ibuprofen I took earlier.
jwb4m5,,gcp79np,I'm just blown away by the amount of pain you must be in and then doing this dental work to yourself....  Are there any dental schools or dentists near you that are seeing people?  You mentioned one that wanted $250 per extraction before...?  I'm wondering if you can get care in exchange for being a student's guinea pig (under a teacher's supervision).....?  Or maybe some place where you could get assistance NOW and pay later type of deal?
jwb4m5,,gcp7l9k,Unfortunately my options are limited. The dentist who quoted me the $250 referred me to a clinic here but they still need to call me back. On top of that I probably would have to wait for dental. The schools that used to do it on pretty much on lock down. I was told I had a gum disease and I'm going to lose all my teeth eventually, I'm only doing it myself because I want to be better. A few hours of extreme pain is better than years of it.
jwb4m5,,gcqqn8b,Tylenol or Ibuprofen is good but you should also get that topical dental painkiller like Oragel that you can get in a tube from places like Walmart. I think it's about $10, I understand it may be an investment in your economic situation, and I'm no dentist or gone through what you are, but it may be worth a try.  I got immediate relief from some dental pain I had been dealing with for days last time I used it.  Worth a shot!
jwb4m5,,gcqr7ta,Yeah I got some oragel this morning it helps for now but tastes like open ass lol.
jwb4m5,,gcse2y9,Remember that a loss of consciousness (passing out) can be fatal if you hit your head or are passed out for any period of time and your tongue blocks your throat and you cannot breath or blood flows in your airway and you cannot clear it because you are passed out. Make sure you are sitting down when you do this with soft surface around.  Ideally, you should do this with someone else around.
jwb4m5,,gcsgyfq,I do what I have to. I know it's not ideal but I have to.
jwb4m5,,gcsm3xl,So the empty sockets will get a blood cloth or a scab that will close off the hole, do not remove this scab, do not pick this scab, rinse only very carefully. If this scab is removed there is a big chance to get dry socket which is just nerve endings exposed to the air, you will not enjoy this, it will take longer to heal and you might need medical help to fix it. If the scab remains in place It should heal up after one or two weeks.  https://www.healthline.com/health/tooth-extraction-aftercare#Aftercare-for-a-tooth-extraction
jwb4m5,,gcsn3pa,Thanks for the advice.
jwb4m5,,gcp8ix2,Yah, I was the one that said salt rinses since it will act as an anti-bacterial agent that helps with the inflammation and healing process.   Maybe once it starts to heal a little more you can do a rinse as your biggest concern is things getting infected. :/  I‚Äôve done after it dental work (root canal, tooth extraction etc) and it wasn‚Äôt too painful and honestly, it‚Äôs probably not going to be anymore painful than what you‚Äôre going through now.    If it gets infected, you‚Äôll be on another level with pain so see if you can at least tolerate a few swishes in your mouth now and work your way up to 30 seconds (don‚Äôt swallow).    From this website:  ‚Äú...provide emergency dental hygiene in the event you don't have your regular mouthwash or toothpaste handy.‚Äù   https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/mouth-sores-and-infections/how-salt-water-mouth-rinse-benefits-oral-health    Again I‚Äôm not a dentist (I only play one on the internet, haha).   Edit:  You definitely don‚Äôt want to get an infection in your mouth as that can easily spread elsewhere. Trying not to scare you but also trying to emphasize that if you can‚Äôt go to a dental school, I really suggest you try a salt water rinse to clean things out.   If you start getting fevers or nausea, go to the ER immediately. At that point, they can‚Äôt just turn you away.  To add, I actually found that the rinses helped reducing the pain after the initial soreness wore off.
jwb4m5,,gcp9ds3,I appreciate the info, I am surprised that salt water doesn't make it worse...?  Like the whole "rubbing salt in a wound" is supposed to make it worse, I thought?  That said, you may want to reply to Hannah and not me so she sees this comment - (she probably will but just in case)
jwb4m5,,gcqkh9s,Slightly salty water matches the body's ph closer than just water. That's why IVs use saline solutions. Pure salt is too much and actually draws water our of the wound, as well.
jwb4m5,,gcsjay2,Ohh...interesting! That def makes sense now that I think about it. Thanks for sharing!
jwb4m5,,gcp9km9,Right? I thought the same too.  I‚Äôm guessing that phrase is referring to make the wound hurt more...lol but technically, it would actually probably heal that wound! Maybe we should say something like ‚Äúrubbing lemon in a wound.‚Äù üòÜ
jwb4m5,,gcscns7,So, I would stay away from Aspirin (ASA / acetylsalicylic acid) for this pain control application because it is also an anti-clotting agent and will lead to increased bleeding. It also should not be taken at the same time as Mortin (Ibuprofen).   Ibuprofen can be taken at the same time as Tylenol (acetaminophen) to potentiate the pain killing effects. This is a good strategy. You also need to be careful with the amount of Ibuprofen you take as it is hard on the stomach. Take with food if possible.   Good luck!
jwb4m5,gcpye7l,,Get whole cloves from the spice area of any grocery and wrap it in cheese cloth or thin t-shirt. Use it as a poultice and put it over your hole and just let it rest there and soak up saliva. It will help both with numbing and disinfection.
jwb4m5,,gcqhpb8,Powdered cloves should work also.
jwb4m5,,gcqjoe3,That may be more comfortable in an open wound too.
jwb4m5,gcpzgc0,,When I was a stupid little kid, if a tooth got lose I'd keep wingling and meesing with it untill it would fall out. Of course there were second "adult teeth" underneath.  As a very poor adult I was glad I had the "training". Almost all my teeth I removed doing it the same way. My wisdom teeth were yanked at 18 by a dentist. Two sub molars were yanked in Mexico for $5 total. My last 4 teeth were removed at a clinic, two were so loose I had planned to remove on my own. Not pleasant, but self extraction was my only option untill I turned 66 and got retirement and medicare.
jwb4m5,,gcq9peu,Yeah it's brutal.
jwb4m5,gcqc0tw,,It's sad its all about money these days.
jwb4m5,,gcqcaf3,Yeah. And tooth pain is bad enough that most people would just pay for it to get away from the pain. I hear other countries have a lot lower rates. Someone in here said Mexico is like $5 to get a tooth pulled. I would be in heaven if I could do that.
jwb4m5,,gcqt5dq,But how is the quality of care?
jwb4m5,,gcqtini,It's pretty standard. They clean up the tooth then numb it and pull it. I had one pulled by a dentist and the procedure only took like 10 minutes.
jwb4m5,,gcwvheg,Apparently pretty good. People cross over from Texas, California, etc... to go to dentists in Mexico. I‚Äôve considered it.
jwb4m5,,gcv6obn,As someone who had a tooth crack, pulled and a root canal that was long overdue, I do not wish tooth pain on my worst enemies. It is the most intolerable full head pounding nightmare you'll ever go through. Wishing you the least amount of pain for your other bad teeth.
jwb4m5,,gcx36rn,Having been through almost word-for-word the same situation... I *would* wish it on my worst enemy. I want them to *suffer.*
jwb4m5,,gcqog5p,Luxury mouth bones ü•¥
jwb4m5,gcqlio1,,Dude I‚Äôve been there it is the worst pulling out your own tooth. DONT SMOKE OR USE A STRAW For 2 weeks dry socket is Way worse than the pain you are feeling RN. Sending positive vibes (cuz that‚Äôs all I got).
jwb4m5,,gcqpu9g,Thank you.
jwb4m5,gcqj1a2,,My friend, please go to an emergency room. Some hospitals also have emergency dental programs where they will check you out and pull teeth professionally, or give you other emergency care. I am very worried you might develop a blood infection.   If you feel like you have a fever, you should go to the ER right NOW. Tell them you have a fever and you have had a series of very bad tooth infections.
jwb4m5,,gcqprv3,I don't have a fever. I just felt really sick after pulling it because the pain. But I've already been to the ER here and they just tell me to go to a dentist.
jwb4m5,,gcrdthq,OK, sounds good. If you do get a fever, please go to the ER. Even if they don't do anything about your teeth, they will give you antibiotics. If they turn you away, with a fever and a history of bad tooth infections, then that would be grounds to sue them. Tooth infections + fever = very high risk it is a blood infection.  No emergency doc in their right mind would turn away someone who likely has a blood infection.
jwb4m5,gcpzhrj,,If you're in a shelter perhaps someone there knows where you can get free dental. Point to the gore that happened yesterday and tell them you have concerns.
jwb4m5,gcq0lf9,,Damn, that‚Äôs some real ass shit bro.. wish you the brst
jwb4m5,,gcqa043,Thanks.
jwb4m5,gcqphok,,Chewing on garlic helps so much! When i had a tootheache, chewinf garlic eased the pain so much.
jwb4m5,,gcqqz4z,Unfortunately chewing anything hurts really bad. My gums have pulled up so much that you can see the roots of most of my teeth so when I chew they wiggle and hurt a lot.
jwb4m5,gcron2j,,Oh god man. I‚Äôm sorry that you have to got through that. Someone show this picture to people who scoff at the homeless and tell them to ‚Äújust get a job‚Äù.
jwb4m5,,gcs3xuf,I just finished my first day at my new job.
jwb4m5,gcp47cn,,I need to at least get some kind of tool to use, my fingers keep slipping off and the pain is out of this world.
jwb4m5,,gcsfavc,Be careful with any sort of tool. The one thing you do not want to do the break the tooth trying to get it out, leaving deep fragments you will never get out.  The technique you are using (caaveman) of rocking it back and forth in different directions is a good technique. If your fingers are slipping off you can wrap them in gauze or dry paper towel which will help you get a "grip" on the slippery tooth.
jwb4m5,,gcsk7uo,Oh good idea ty.
jwb4m5,gcpyj6x,,You're hardcore as hell haha. I still have part of my tooth that has too go. I'm at the wiggle part still, since some remains. It's tough but I know theres strong people that lost thier teeth and still choose too be a decent, kind and trying people. It's gunna help build character haha.. goodluck stay strong. Glad you're managing yourself and being strong about it.
jwb4m5,gcq22vx,,If you live in a diverse enough city that has a latino neighborhood I would try to hit up a dentist there and I‚Äôm sure they would try to assist. When I was traveling and gathering stories from other travelers, emergency care by gang members and just seemingly anybody bleeding or needing something done just showed up to a vet or office with medicinal supplies in the Mexican neighborhood. Maybe time it to go just before the end of business hours so nobody has to worry about a potential do good turning the company in for something...  So twisted why it‚Äôs even like that but I‚Äôve heard some pretty crazy stories.
jwb4m5,gcs439f,,**sees and cries**
jwb4m5,,gcs47vh,Awe no don't cry I'll be okay.
jwb4m5,,gcs4btd,Could you at least get the stuff I recommended?
jwb4m5,,gcs4ra7,Yeah and I got some little toothpick things. Some Salt and coconut oil for something I want to try. I haven't felt too bad today because I was working. Just gonna hang here a sec then back to the tent.
jwb4m5,,gcx3988,How are you doing tonight?
jwb4m5,,gcx6p47,Hey. I'm doing okay.
jwb4m5,,gcx6xnq,I'm glad to hear it
jwb4m5,gcssae6,,Hi l know what you are going through l have had lots of trouble with my teeth here's what l had to do n l never got infection you pack the tooth socket with gau's or material like strips of pillow cases make sure it's clean do that for first 24 hour's then take 4 or 8oz of warm water n1/2 table spoon of salt table salt is fine n gargle 3/4 times a day or after you eat something at first gargle soft n let it soak if it's bottom tooth make sure not to switch it to hard in mouth because you have a blood clot starting in your socket n if you rinse that out you will get dry socket it's called n you don't want that because then you do have to go to the dentist because they have to scrape your socket most likely it's infected n have to clean that out n start over with new blood clot n there can be alot of pain with it . But we'll say your doing good reminder no sucking through a straw or smoking that suctioning can make you loose that blood clot so just be aware for at least 3 day's to be careful about it. By the third day you should feel alot better n your socket should be kinda white in color because of rinsing with salt water, but still be careful about what you are doing make sure to chew on opposite side of mouth n always rinse if you start or are still throbbing in your mouth check out socket because you may have food in there ! That's why chew on other side n rinse good after you eat if you can do that you will see that socket start to shrink n then you are on your way to healing fast. First 3 day's be very careful, 5/6 day's still be rinsing to keep it clean until socket starts to shrink. If you feel like you have food stuck in you socket you can rinse with peroxide n just let it soak it should bubble up any food in the socket still be careful of the blood clot in there. I hope this helps you it has always worked for me!! If you need or want to chat with me about anymore tooth trouble go ahead l would be happy to help you . I hope this helps you too n it will work for any other teeth you might loose . Bless you n may some good fortune come your way.
jwb4m5,,gcssmm0,Thanks for the advice.
jwb4m5,,gcstgxj,Your welcome n l added more to read it is a precaution please read thank you n bless you to help you through this time
jwb4m5,,gcst932,Oh l wanted to say when pulling your teeth you have to be careful you don't have a abscess because if you do that pain is almost unbearable n it will also Poison your body witch can or will kill you! But pulling them if you pull your tooth n you have a abscess n it breaks you better see a doctor it will Poison your body again n you can die not something to mess with and an abscess on your tooth is a sack of poison attached to your roots n be very careful not to break that sack, n it can brake pretty easy when pulling, dentist will usually not pull an abscess tooth they give you antibiotics for at least 5days so l just wanted to have you be aware of that.!!
jwb4m5,gcsdr0c,,Trying to get a picture in order to offer advice. How are you making out mate? How many more teeth are you thinking of self-extracting? How is the pain and bleeding from those sites you have pulled teeth?  How are you feeling in general?   Salt water rinses are good advice, in general. The risk is that in the first 12-24 hours after you pulled the tooth you need to let clot form and the mouth rinse can dislodge the clot if too aggressive.  You do not want to deal with this.  Wait 24 hours after the tooth comes out. Then go easy. One teaspoon of salt in warm water is the common recommendation. Any salt is better than no salt. Cold water will work if you cannot find warm water. Easy rinse holding the salt water in your mouth for 1 minute.  Do this 4 times a day.   Good luck and I am rooting for you.  See my other comments in this thread.   Life will get easier if you can get your mouth under control.
jwb4m5,,gcsgtp3,Hey sorry I been kinda busy today. But I'll try to get back and answer these questions soon.
jwb4m5,,gcsigsw,NP.  Another good resource if you want to read about some of this stuff is a book called, "Where there is no dentist".  You can find it here: [http://www.freedompreppers.com/where-there-is-no-dentist.pdf](http://www.freedompreppers.com/where-there-is-no-dentist.pdf)  It is a book about what people can do for themselves and each other to care for their gums and teeth. It is written for mostly people working in the developing world (village and neighborhood health workers) who want to learn more about dental care as part,  school teachers, mothers, fathers, and anyone concerned with encouraging dental health in their children and their community. Good read. I have used it as my bible in dentistry (as a non-dentist) in the developing world for along time.
jwb4m5,,gcskhk8,After everything I've researched myself and things I've learned from others I should be able to start my own dental clinic lol.
jwb4m5,gcp65y9,,Go to an ER. They can help.
jwb4m5,,gcp6cf4,I have. They sent me away saying it's illegal to do dental work.
jwb4m5,,gcpn99i,The fact you're feeling sick makes me think you're developing sepsis. If things progress to a fever that doesn't pass, go back to the ER.  In the meantime, I'd recommend looking up your state's Medicaid program and calling their hotline to ask about emergency extraction. In more than a few states they will apply your Medicaid coverage to outstanding bills retroactively for the two or three months prior to your approval (you don't need to pay these bills out of pocket, and shouldn't, in case you won't be reimbursed).  Best of luck.
jwb4m5,,gcqofe0,They won't do dental work but they will usually write a prescription for antibiotics .If you don't knock out the infection you could really be in trouble especially if the tooth is in your upper set of teeth . Even getting teeth pulled when they are that infected means you need to clear up the infection . Home remedies can work but sometimes it is really dire and can become life or death . Not trying to tell you what to do , just have some experience with this through my ex .
jwb4m5,gcqrcso,,Thats not a cavity , that is full on decay. Those nerves are now exposed. Good luck. Hydrogen peroxide is a cheap oral debriding agent. Again, good luck. If you were feeling sick. You were being poisoned by your own mouth. Again, best of luck.
jwb4m5,,gcsf16d,Hydrogen peroxide is not a bad solution to killing infection and bacteria in the mouth.  Whatever you do - DO NOT swallow.  It will make you really sick. Can use care immediately after pulling a tooth as you do not want to disrupt the clot (see my other post on mouth rinse).  If you want to make the hydrogen peroxide last longer, you can dilute common pharmacy hydrogen peroxide (3%) as 50% water with 50% hydrogen peroxide.  It will not make removing teeth easier, but might help solve other problems.
jwb4m5,gcqo8t0,,Please look into a dental school. My ex had stereotypical meth mouth & that‚Äôs hard to get help for because people don‚Äôt want to help since it‚Äôs ‚Äúself inflicted‚Äù, but they approved him after I wrote them a letter begging to work on him. He, however, couldn‚Äôt not stay off the drugs and couldn‚Äôt go under anesthesia so he missed out on a COMPLETE dental reconstructive surgery for free. The options are out there. Hopefully Covid won‚Äôt delay appointments but I assume these college courses have steamed ahead as normal. It‚Äôs something to check into
jwb4m5,gcr7dmb,,idk if you‚Äôve tried it but I used chloroseptic for my fucked up teeth. It‚Äôs a spray for numbing your throat when you get sick. It doesn‚Äôt last terribly long but it beats the hell out of ibuprofen and give instant relief. I‚Äôd just spray a few shots in my mouth and let it pool around the affected teeth. Complete pain removal. It‚Äôs the only way I could sleep. I think a bottle is like $5-6. They sell it at drug stores
jwb4m5,,gcr83z9,Oh yeah I used it before. Didn't think about it for tooth pain thanks for the advice.
jwb4m5,,gcv5812,Also this is probably no help, but whole cloves can help. As in, the spice. Not ground; whole. Bite down on it and it‚Äôs a natural numbing agent. It tastes horrid, minty in a really bad way, but it‚Äôs an old English remedy for toothache. Used it myself a few times. Plus it‚Äôs cheap, so.
jwb4m5,gdshtug,,Hi there! If you contact dental schools in your area they might be able to help for free. You can also contact homeless shelters to see if they can point you in the right direction. Contact dental offices in your area, sometimes they will do pro-bono work or donate services. It is definitely worth an ask!
jwb4m5,gcu5vi5,,Damn i hope i never have to pull my wisdom myself fuck
jwb4m5,gcwvhfk,,If the other teeth you gotta pull have any part of the top of the tooth left get some pliers and another person to pull it make sure you have paper towels gauze tp whatever for blood and to apply pressure to stop bleeding.
jvzvaw,gcngxxo,,Shake hands with some people and better count how many fingers you draw back. The fact you were near a trail shows there other people coming thru the area, either established trail or worn by foot traffic. There are those who beat the bush all the time just to steal the crumbs from a poor man.  I had a nice camp 15 miles from down town not really in town at all. I figured it would be safe.  I came back one night and found my camp had been gone thru. There wasn't anything of value a tent and sleeping bag maybe. My $10 battery powered hair clippers were gone. I remembered a jogger who jogged on a nearby road.  I usely got up early to leave so no one was awake to see me. Next day was Sunday so I waited to later to leave. As I was a block or so away I noticed the jogger. I waited just a minute and daw him duck into the trees and brush where I camp. I had 3 exits/ entrances to the spot so there's not a well worn trail.  I slipping in quietly thru another entrance. He might have slipped in to piss one day and found my stuff. Reguardless I watched him head right to my camp and start digging around.  He grabbed my cheap pocket radio and turn around to leave. I was right in back of him. He looked at me  I punched him right smack in the face.  With a bloody nose he ran like a bat out of hell. I packed up my camp, and left town.
jvzvaw,,gcnlbv6,The thing  is there are 3 people that comes by and im not sure which one it is that stole my stuff. One guy isn‚Äôt homeless and knows me pretty well and we‚Äôre in pretty good relationship so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs him.  Other guy is a little crazy bottle collector that comes by once in a while who interrupted me once while collecting bottles by opening the tarp i was in, thinking no ones there. The thing is he could‚Äôve stolen my bag without waking me up but he checked that i was in there and left.  The last guy I‚Äôm most suspicious of since he once took my sleeping bag that i left out but its been some time since he left ever since his makeshift tent got demolished by rain. He hasn‚Äôt been back and i never saw him so far.
jvzvaw,,gcof5hv,Dude you have too many people coming through your camp.
jvzvaw,,gcof7cq,Not a lot of place to camp in nyc unfortunately
jvzvaw,,gcofl1b,NYC?  I feel for you.
jvzvaw,,gcoefoz,I can't fucking believe this guy! I'm so angry at this, I mean if you're a jogger you have a home, you have time on your hand to go for a jog you aren't surviving you're taking care of yourself, why the fuck do you go around stealing things you probably don't even need from a person who has nothing! I'm with op on that, people are the worst.
jvzvaw,,gco3kyy,The police used to come find our camps in the woods (wish I were kidding) by using the homeless census some years ago to locate us. They'd show up to camp with "citizen volunteers" and tear them down right in front of us. They would stomp on laptops and cell phones if they found them. They would bring trash bags and throw everyone's stuff in the bags. If anyone had animals they were seized immediately and impounded. They harrassed us relentlessly.
jvzvaw,gcnkdhx,,I know what you mean. I was less cautious than you, and left all my stuff back at my campsite. I went to the daily food truck, came back, and everything was gone. I'm talking my tent, my BOW, my sleeping arrangements. Everything. I only had the clothes on my back and what was in those clothes. It's shitty to say but you most likely won't get anything back. I'm sorry for your losses, but hopefully in the future you can prevent this. It shouldn't happen at all, I mean that's all you have man, it's so fucked up that some jackass feels entitled enough to take your everything away basically, but things come and go, and you can likely replace them. Again, in no way am I defending their actions, and in so sorry for the rough morning you must have had. Best of luck out there, you aren't alone, even if you'll never meet the people like you.

jvzvaw,,gcnkayy,Yeah but i just feel really bad because even though he‚Äôs well off I‚Äôve been asking him frequently lately and he‚Äôs the same age as me. Especially since the stuff i lost are pretty new and he‚Äôs helping me despite his family not really approving it.

jvzvaw,,gcnm9yg,Yeah they prolly stole to satisfy drug habits but bet they were disappointed. It still hurts because the umbrella was a really nice automatic one and the tarp was a big one too

jvzvaw,,gcohghi,I had a cheapo second hand bike. I got up every morning at 4am by 5 my stuff was packed up and camo stashed. I spent 4 hours canning. I filled up a big with crushed cans. At 9 I'd be at the scrape yard when it opened. Always at least $10. Then to a soupline for lunch and supper. After 2 weeks I had more thsn enough for a storage unit. With my stuff stashed safely I keep doing the canning. After 2 monthes I'd saved up enough for a new Walmart bike. With a few other odds and ends.
jvzvaw,,gcohshc,How does it work specifically? I‚Äôve thought about collecting bottles and cans but i didn‚Äôt know how to do it, where to take it to. On the Internet it says every participating store accepts them but idk where
jvzvaw,,gcoipdg,Some states pay by the can/bottle, hard to find cans/bottles. Others pay by the pound. Lots more cans to be found. I crush them by stepping  on them. Find a scrape yard, usually has a sign say so much a lb for aluminum so much a lb for copper. You bring them in, they get weighed you get payed.  Some tramps use a shopping cart some use bags tied to a bike. A cheap used bike gives more range.
jvzvaw,,gcoiv48,Huh ok thanks ill see if there are any in nyc
jvzvaw,gcoev12,,This is why wherever I go, my bag goes with me. I learned by hitchhiking, never leave your bag alone.   It's a pain having to carry everything with me, especially since it's winter and it's Heather due to winter gear/extra clothes and jackets. But I can't afford to lose this stuff, I'd be totally fucked.
jvzvaw,,gcoflwb,The thing is my bag was right next to me but they took it anyways while i was asleep
jvzvaw,,gcofqru,Yeah, it always comes in my tent with me, even though there's no room. I'm basically hugging my backpack haha
jvzvaw,,gcofted,I‚Äôll keep that in mind and just tie the bag to myself
jvzvaw,gco9e7j,,What state are you in?
jvzvaw,,gcoeaej,NYC
jvzvaw,gcof3yo,,Don't let it get to you. Just keep your chin up. When it happens to me, I always tell myself that they probably needed it more than me.   This always makes me feel better. It still sucks, but you can change how you feel about it. We're all trying our best out here.
jvzvaw,,gcofi0x,Thanks but i just can‚Äôt wrap my head around the idea of somebody needing it more than a homeless 16 year old who has no way of earning money stabley whereas adult homeless can get ebt and stuff
jvzvaw,,gcog1xz,Sure, and yet here we are. Imagine being an adult feeling the need to steal from a 16 year old. How shitty must that life be, right?   If you want to feel good, breath in and out, let it go, and move on. Learn your lesson for next time. Trust me kid, forgiveness will do you a world of wonders in the homeless life. It's either forgive or become bitter. And that's your choice.   It sucks, yes, but what sucks more is not being able to let go and forgive.

jvzvaw,,gcw51ns,Ive not yet received my package from my friend but u/RollinRibs25 patched me up with an umbrella and sleeping bag
jvzvaw,,gd2blt9,Yeah, I read that a very cool person reached out and helped. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about. Everybody doing some part, so not a burden on one person as far as helping another human being. You‚Äôre pretty resilient too. Keep the hope.   P.s.  you know having your things stolen was awful, but it gave some one an opportunity to grow their soul.
jvcrfu,gciwa27,,I'm so glad for you! ...first steps out of the dark. Let us know how it goes, okay? Everyone needs some encouragement that there is a way out of here.
jvcrfu,,gciwhtx,I will. I'm already making plans lol
jvcrfu,gcj3uct,,Congrats!  The first few days of a new job can be stressful, it will feel like you're making a bunch of mistakes, but hang in there, and just make sure you're getting better every day.
jvcrfu,,gcj6f84,It's just dish washing. I think it'll be easy.
jvcrfu,,gcjesbl,It‚Äôs a very important job, a good dishwasher can make a restaurant run smoothly. Good luck!
jvcrfu,,gcjg129,Thanks.
jvcrfu,,gckv9ff,You are likely understimating the role.
jvcrfu,,gcl9thb,I‚Äôve been working in restaurants for over a decade. Dishie is probably the most important person there. Work hard, don‚Äôt complain.
jvcrfu,,gcla1m8,I d think I can ever complain again if I'm making money.
jvcrfu,,go6vnsk,Uh ..washing dishes is not "easy." It is backbreaking work.
jvcrfu,,go6xaur,Unfortunately I lost the job.
jvcrfu,,go6yq7q,Sorry to hear that. What happened?
jvcrfu,,go6yvzf,Closed for the season
jvcrfu,gciwx80,,Congratulations!!!!!!!

jvcrfu,,gcj1onk,Thanks.

jvcrfu,,gcskbbf,Was rough but I think I did good. I go back Friday for another shift.
jvcrfu,,gcu44eu,Ive been going through your posts for a couple of hours. I am really rooting for you. You can do this.
jvcrfu,,gcu49z0,Thanks.
jvcrfu,gcizu7h,,Yay! Congrats!!
jvcrfu,,gcj09oi,Thanks.
jvcrfu,gcj3alx,,Good for you. When you "pearl dive" you get to eat good. Put on a few pounds you lost at the souplines. You'll be on your way before you know it.
jvcrfu,,gcj65xu,Thanks.
jvcrfu,gcjrsvl,,Dude I'm currently a dishwasher also and let me tell you it's gonna suck but don't quit! You're gonna have bad days and then worse days, but it'll be worth it when you have your own money.
jvcrfu,gcj5p32,,Congradulations!
jvcrfu,,gcj6ss9,Thanks
jvcrfu,gcjgc9b,,YESS less go my dudee
jvcrfu,gcju3no,,Out-fucking-standing!!!
jvcrfu,gck3mo0,,I had two dishwashing jobs.  They were quite easy and people treated me kindly.
jvcrfu,gclixzb,,Good. For. You.    It kinda depends what kind of service you're  working (buffet is *not* the same thing as dinner service for a dish guy), but if you're wrangling lots of bowls and plates from customers in a high volume, sautee-heavy restaurant, the optimal workflow for me was:    1. Scrape into the trash  2. Wipe down in a dunk sink  3. Stack in the rack, and into the dishwasher.   Trying to spray every dish will absolutely get you killed, and have pissed off cooks "accidentally" burning you and throwing things at your station.    You'll  have to muck out the dunk sink every hour or two and refill it with soap and water, but the efficiency is worth it.     Keep your mouth shut and do whatever senior dish guys do until you have a chance to set up your own workflow.   Go get it, OP.   edit: sautee
jvcrfu,,gcmgdbg,Thanks for the advice.
jvcrfu,gcjzlpf,,Awesome! Glad it worked out...So proud of you.
jvcrfu,gcjzmur,,Congrats!
jvcrfu,gck45dw,,You can move up from a dishwasher too. It might not happen overnight. Congratulations!
jvcrfu,,gckaj34,I'm just ready to have something steady so I can keep a roof over my head.
jvcrfu,,gckee0k,Absolutely.
jvcrfu,gcmkd46,,Congratulations! You got this!
jvcrfu,,gcmkge0,Thanks.
jvcrfu,gco2gi7,,Congratulations! I‚Äôve washed dishes in many different types of restaurants. Some are easier than others. From my experience, Italian places are the hardest. A lot of stuff burns onto the pans and other stuff dries up quickly. Keep everything wet and if something doesn‚Äôt come off easy just let it soak while you hit the other stuff, unless they need it like right now. In that case, hit it as hard and fast as you can. No use dicking around with the burn shit unless absolutely necessary.
jvcrfu,gck5g50,,This is how it starts!
jvcrfu,gcl1mp7,,Congrats.  Try to get something to eat while there especially at closing time.
jvcrfu,gcl4yrk,,Super congratulations. Very happy for you.  This will be the step that raises you out of these hard times with a brighter future with the wisdom you have gained. 2021
jvcrfu,,gcl52ki,Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
jvcrfu,gcla574,,Do you have an address or PO Box? I have a couple bucks left on an Amazon card, and I‚Äôd like to send you a lotion. You‚Äôll need it.
jvcrfu,,gclaiq5,I don't sorry. I think there's like a few Amazon locker locations here but I don't know 100% how they work
jvcrfu,,gclb9iq,So basically, I‚Äôll get a code to open it that I can send to you.
jvcrfu,,gclbdcg,Yeah I think. I'm not really sure I never used it. But I saw a few around town.
jvcrfu,,gclbemq,Ooh, I could send it to the restaurant if your boss is cool with that? You‚Äôre gonna need hand lotion, girl. Dish pit effs your hands up.
jvcrfu,,gclblf0,Lol my teeth are falling out, I don't think rough hands are going to be a priority for me.
jvcrfu,,gclbrj9,OOf, unfortunately same. But I can afford a three dollar lotion for you, I can‚Äôt afford dental care. I literally sent some dude a picture of my boobs for this money. It‚Äôs no big deal to buy you a lotion.
jvcrfu,,gclci8s,üòÇ Yeah I tried that. One guy was putting me up in motels and stuff. I tried it with someone else and he said he felt like he wasted his money. Like wtf I'm not going to get naked outside you know. But thanks for the offer but I'll probably be fine. And I can pick up some lotion myself if I feel like I need it.
jvcrfu,,gclcuq8,I‚Äôm housed up right now, so I can afford little things. If you change your mind, please message me. I‚Äôll get you a tube of aquaphor.   Ugh, the dude sending me money is getting way too pushy as well. I‚Äôll take it while I can. At least he‚Äôs hours away from me. Makes it easier.
jvcrfu,,gcld47g,One guy like 4000 miles away asked me to move there but I have a few reasons why I didn't. He was cool and going to pay for my dental issues.
jvcrfu,,gcld8a5,I don‚Äôt trust any of those dudes. They want a homeless girl for a reason.
jvcrfu,,gcldeql,Yeah sex lol. But I'm not against the idea. And he wasn't ugly or anything. His **** was pretty nice too. I just have reasons why I can't really move right now.
jvcrfu,gclna1a,,Cool, that's great news. I'll be praying that things only get better for you, and that God will continue to bless you. As well as all of us who are facing hardships during this unusual season. üôÇ
jvcrfu,,gcmgja1,Thank you.

jvcrfu,,gcwiofh,I did yes. I worked 1 day and go back tomorrow. I have yet to make a post about it but I will soon.
jvcrfu,gcyugrx,,I'm so happy for you! Congratulations! A jobs a job, no matter what it is.
jvcrfu,,gcz5lw8,I have yet to be paid but just knowing that I'm working towards something has lifted my spirits.
jvcrfu,,gczidz6,Definitely! Work is such a boost.

jvcrfu,gcvv7pq,,Awesome! Let us know how it goes.  Congratulations!!!
jvcrfu,gf9t3om,,Congrats!!!!
jvcrfu,gfccd9z,,How's the job?
juqls9,gcf0qp3,,Crazy isn‚Äôt it?! How people try to scam those really down in their luck. You figure they would try to find people with loads of liquidity and can afford it. Nope! They do it because it is easier to screw people over that are already down and most people well off are harder to scam.
juqls9,,gcf14ao,I think it's because poor people are desperate for help. Enough that they are willing to take a chance like that.
juqls9,,gcfa7ch,At one point I almost considered taking a cheque online that they had to send me a picture of and expected me to cut out so I could take a real pic and upload it to my bank. I knew the scam and knew it would bounce but had an addiction to feed and almost did it anyways just for the temporary cash. So glad I didn't.
juqls9,,gcfamqg,Well I mean yeah quick easy cash. But eventually you'll have an arrest warrant for check fraud. Makes it a lot harder to get a job and stuff.
juqls9,,gcivvy1,Very glad I stayed out of it all lol. Recovery came so much easier when I didn't have to worry about 26,000 in payday loans, debt to family, friends, coworkers and bosses.   As far as being a degenerate junkie goes, I made it pretty easy on myself.
juqls9,,gcfqkc1,Yeah, this is the entire point of payday loans.  Even the Ancient Roman version. I used to wonder why they preyed on people who couldn't afford to pay them back, but then 2008 happened and I understood.
juqls9,,gcfqobi,Yeah.
juqls9,,gcf7wtp,People who ar desperate are easier to scam, unfortunately.
juqls9,gcf2q2r,,Thank you so much for the info.  I almost got scammed by this once but my bank was like "toby we gotta tell you something" and they explained it to me.
juqls9,,gcf55bo,Yeah most banks won't care. And now there are banks that let you just upload a picture of the check.
juqls9,gceuadj,,There are lots of scams on reddit right now.  Be wary.
juqls9,,gceum4z,Yeah but also a lot of great people.
juqls9,,gcft5pg,True. Yet the scammers florish. Why?  Because most people overestimate their ability to distinguish between the two.
juqls9,,gcfthqx,Yeah
juqls9,gceweu4,,Post karma 1 credit karma 0. Definitely a scam artist.
juqls9,,gcewm05,Yeah I just wanted to make people aware so they don't fall for it.
juqls9,gcf2fqg,,The account is posting a bunch of feel good helping people shit too. Disgusting.
juqls9,,gcf5029,Yeah I saw 2 posts earlier about helping people. Like this person is trying to make it more believable.
juqls9,gcf2jd9,,If it sounds to good to be true, is is.
juqls9,gchfaud,,I actually took a check to the police about 4 years ago when someone tried this scam.  I was trying to sell my small trailer on Craigslist and they sent me a check then reported my post so I couldn't complete a transaction with any 'legitimate' prospects. So when I finally got the check I looked up the sender...it was a ID stolen from a legitimate company...so they were attempting to steal from two sources...me and the company that allegedly sent the check.
juqls9,gcj3m82,,Thanks for the info. there are some weird people around. I had almost the same when i made a emotional post in the Depression sub. A few minutes later a person send me a private message to download a app for dating for depressed people...wtf....People are really shit sometimes.
juqls9,,gcj6bks,Lol imagine going to dinner with someone and you both just sit there sighing.
juqls9,,gcjgc30,hahaha!
jv1bgb,gchl2r2,,One thing I have learned over the years of being homeless - the people who area already in the worst shape, who are least able to afford it - are usually the ones who are the most willing to help out. Backwards of how I would have thought. Good for you. Hopefully the universe will return the kind gesture.
jv1bgb,,gci0q0d,I read this book about two years ago, I can't remember the title or the author, but it was about Germany after world war 1. The story follows a young boy who's trying to survive in the city of berlin homeless.   Anyway, there's this line that really stuck to me, it went something like this:   "Giving is a hobby of the poor; they feel poverty reflexively"  And that's how I think to- people who are wealthy don't know what it is like to be impoverished or houselessness. They don't know what it's like to worry about freezing to death next week, or how it feels to wonder if you'll eat, or sleep at all today. They just don't know because they've never experienced it.   Other poor people know what it's like, so we generally stick together. A "Today you, tomorrow me" mentality.    Sorry I couldn't find the book, it bothers me so much that I can't remember it!
jv1bgb,,gci1kno,That makes sense. I can't understand or comprehend rich people. I always think how much it would bother me to know that people were suffering, freezing, starving if I were to consider buying a third or fourth Mercedes or another vacation home. There is something wrong with a system that allows - or worse - encourages - this kind of thinking. There was just a thread yesterday on my local sub about best local steakhouse for around $100 per person. I just sat there and looked at that title for a long time.
jv1bgb,,gci64pr,[removed]
jv1bgb,,gci78te,I have been living on so little, spending so little every day for so long now, I don't think I would be able to change. I sometimes - like probably everyone does - daydream about winning the lottery and still have a hard time seeing myself spending more than I have to for stuff. Maybe I'm wrong. After all, you see stories all the time about rich people who supposedly used to be dirt poor. I guess everyone is different.
jv1bgb,gcgz6n6,,Good on you.
jv1bgb,,gcgze6d,Thanks.
jv1bgb,gci4tvh,,I usually help people whether I‚Äôm homeless or not. But one thing I hate is when people lying about needing food so I offer to buy whatever they want in the store with my Snap card. Then suddenly they are no longer hungry or don‚Äôt have the 3 kids to feed. Don‚Äôt ask me for food when we are right in front of Walmart or target and can grab some snacks and juices and lunchables.   Liars just need drugs. I don‚Äôt carry cash. So that‚Äôs my answer now. I hate lying. Lol
jv1bgb,,gciw9fx,I fly a sign for food but if someone offers to buy me something with SNAP i say no thanks because its against the rules to do that, you can only spend them on you or your household and you can lose your benifits for buying others food with them. This may be why they are saying no, I am a really paranoid person though and dont want anyone losing their benifits because of me.
jv1bgb,,gco5lro,Yea they totally will know about it. Especially if I just give them something that‚Äôs already in my car. Lol But in any case, totally don‚Äôt have money to give them for food if I have to use snap for mine. And why don‚Äôt they have their own.. did they really run out and don‚Äôt know how to budget it? Personally would not be buying or eating a lot. One meal a day is better than trying to figure out where the next one is coming from.
jv1bgb,,gcibed3,I would take food if offered, but I have bad teeth and gum problems so some things I can't eat and would be wasted on me. But soups or like cans of ravioli are a good buy.
jv1bgb,gcgzj42,,And hopefully the next homeless person you meet will give you his last money from his wallet.  Good karma, I guess?
jv1bgb,,gcgzngx,Nah it just feels good to share.
jv1bgb,gcijb1j,,I find this hard to believe
jv1bgb,,gcijtmq,It's true. I can give his username but he might not respond it took him nearly a week to get back to me with his cashapp tag.
jv1bgb,,gciqgyf,Oh, The scene when totally different in my mind... I thought it happened like in person, like in real life.... not online. I'm Dumb
jv1bgb,,gcisejm,Lol no. It was just a guy I met on here and I said I would share because someone helped me. Kinda just paying it forward.
jv1bgb,,gcj0v76,It is still hard to believe, I never seen that kind of Kindness... Are you a communist or socialist by any chance?
jv1bgb,,gcj1n6i,No. I'm just Hannah. I was worried that the person I sent it to might use it for drugs or something but it's not my place to judge. Being human means we are supposed to care about each other.
jv1bgb,,gclq455,>Are you a communist or socialist by any chance?   >   > No. I'm just Hannah.   This answer. I love it. Thank you.
jv1bgb,gcv7vr7,,Some people are too good for this world
juszzg,gcfc1m2,,You have a TV/movie idea of what prison is actually like. Most prisons have eliminated education opportunities along with in person visits. The food is often horrible, so is the medical care and general conditions. Prisons are violent and assaults are common. It's not a solution to homelessness.
juszzg,,gcfiqsl,And unless youre married and fit a very strict criteria they dont allow private visits with your woman. Even then, in the large majority of US prisons, they dont allow it. Thats mostly a thing of the past
juszzg,gcfe9so,,Some make prison their home because in the walls they are something besides a bum, a con. Some people make the streets their home because on the streets they are something besides a con, a bum. Some people make a crummy job their home because with a job you are something besides a bum or con, a wage slave. If you do something for a long time; 20 years at the factory, 20 years on the street, 20 years in the walls, it becomes a routine you are used to and still to your comfort zone.
juszzg,gcfuqpc,,As soon as you are in you do nothing but wish you were out
juszzg,,gcfw43c,And as soon as you are out you do nothing but wish you were in again
juszzg,gcfapfr,,There are limits in prison.  You get only what they allow you to have.  And you get it when they decide that you should have it.  If you want to settle for mediocrity, and someone else making most of the decisions about your life, then maybe prison is okay for you.  But if you want to reach even a tenth of your potential, streets are better.  From Shawshank Redemption: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeMux1GjA7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeMux1GjA7Y)
juszzg,,gcj7c69,Those people in the video are wearing nice and clean clothes
juszzg,gcgqbxh,,I have several friends who have worked in the US prison system- They say while yes, they have shelter, it isn't exactly what you picture and it most definitely isn't going to be better than certain streets. They always complain of the smell. Often when inmates do get showers, they are freezing. There's also a ton of rodents.  The food is prepared by inmates, so yeah, it can be pretty awful. Often times when you do go to prison, you will get pushed around by prisoners who have been their longer (i.e. people will steal your food). Since you are surrounded by violent felons there's also a chance that you could upset someone and punched or worse, stabbed. Weapons run rampant. The noise level can be intolerable. Supplies can run low and sometimes you can even be left without clothing. And definitely don't go if you have a delicate psyche. There are people there who have committed unspeakable acts. So, no there's not an art-studio and a state-of-the-art library. There are certain things that can help you improve so that you can re-integrate back into the community such as the GED program and anger management courses, but nothing fancy. Part of it is conditioning humans into believing that in order to have nice things, they must act better and obviously not commit criminal acts.
juuyzp,gcgskgo,,I appreciate your honesty and all, saying you're a journalist but you know folks here aren't doing great financially and you're going to get paid to use this information they provide, any chance you provide like a gift card for fast food or maybe some sort of assistance in return to the people who share their story with you?
juuyzp,,gchu0n9,Hi there - I totally hear you on this and understand if folks can't make time for this right now if they're not going to be compensated for it. Unfortunately, journalistic ethics and company policy prevent me from providing financial assistance to sources.  I'm hoping to share these stories in order to shed light on how the government has failed to respond to this crisis and am thankful to everyone who has emailed me and DM'd me to help tell the story accurately and fairly.  Thank you for your question!
juuyzp,,gciwa1p,I understand. Well I hope you get plenty of responses and that your story changes how folks are treated. Thank you for responding and please, when you write your story, ,can you come back with a link to the story. I'm sure a lot of us would love to read it.
juuyzp,,gcj48y7,I'll certainly come back here and post it. Thanks for engaging with me here!
juuyzp,,ge6cka6,Hi there! Just wanted to share my story posted over the weekend. Please let me know if you have any thoughts/concerns! And again thank you to everyone who spoke with me for this story, not every story made it in but it helped me understand where folks are coming from during this crisis.

juakgj,gcehsa9,,Happy to hear this news for you!  It's amazing how involved and complicated getting "a real job" can be for those of us on the outs. So many of us would love the opportunity to have a reliable income, but the system is literally engineered for folks who've already got a foothold in life.   The inverse relationship between bank accounts and phone numbers and an address and so on can make this near impossible.   You've got this! It seems you've got lots of folks on your side and in your corner if you land the job! I know it'll be hard, but I believe in you.
juakgj,,gceq30j,Thanks.
jtt4eo,gc7rzkl,,well, let's hope they didn't get fired for doing that.   People are kind, corporate aren't
jtt4eo,,gc8axch,Corporate are definitely jerks. I used to work at a long John silvers way back. When we had food left over, I used to give it to the homeless that lived under the nearby bridge. I nearly lost my job over that. Corporate said it would ‚Äúattract undesirables‚Äù to the store. Seriously? That food was destined for the trash. So I would just box it up, pay for it, then take it to them anyway. I had the receipt that said it was paid for so they couldn‚Äôt say anything after that. Those guys ended up as friends back them. They were probably the nicest people I knew as well. They knew when I worked and would often drop in and buy a small drink and sit in the dining area just to be inside for a bit. They knew I‚Äôd have food for them after I got off work. I always made sure there would be something left over too.
jtt4eo,,gc97gt7,That‚Äôs awesome of you!
jtt4eo,,gc7sgp7,Yeah he was really cool.
jtt4eo,gc9rk8z,,My job does this with the canceled or unclaimed Uber Eats etc orders too. They‚Äôre doing so poorly they have decided to not allow a free credit meal for employees anymore, so idk how that‚Äôs gonna play out now
jtkpqv,gc7eo2g,,I mean you know the vibe best but I would've left too, you were clearly not up for an actual conversation lol. I wouldn't have left because you were homeless.
jtkpqv,,gc7ild4,I agree, I would have thought it was a hint to go away and leave them alone
jtkpqv,,gc7evqg,Totally.
jtkpqv,gc70uby,,I guess it means you don‚Äôt look homeless. ü§£
jtkpqv,,gc70y34,Yeah my homeless card expired I guess.
jtkpqv,,gc81h3d,Oh you better renew it or they will kick you out, then where will you go?

jtkpqv,,gc6ubxr,Yes quite.
jtkpqv,,gc911f7,Love a good nap.
jtkpqv,gc910ir,,Dam!! Cold old bat
jtkpqv,gc93yy2,,why say you‚Äôre homeless just curious, she didn‚Äôt ask. you could‚Äôve had the conversation going and then if it came up you say it as to not scare her away. next time try interacting with people without telling them you‚Äôre homeless until later, you obviously didn‚Äôt seem homeless to her when she approached you.
jtkpqv,,gc9fev4,Yeah I know but I didn't really care to have a conversation with her lol
jtkpqv,,gcaef1r,understandable
jtkpqv,gc6p8al,,Google: free things to do in <city name>. Then you can say, would you  like to go with me to (such & such)?
jtkpqv,,gc6pgrr,Lol
jtkpqv,,gc73sk9,Get some bro!

I don't off, who'd be kind enough to help me out like that lmao, but it's nice to make yourself smile. They'll probably forget you by tomorrow anyways, and right nows all that matters. Another one I like to do is just walk into, say macdons, and just go up to the cashier who's my age, and look them straight in the face, tell them I'm homeless and leave. It's beautiful to see their mind race for that one second before I'm gone. Maybe they feel better about themselves. Maybe their scared. Maybe their humbled. Maybe all, but it's sure fun for me. I know I sound nuts. Or like an asshole, but come on now, a guys gotta chuckle somehow or another, and I'm not actually hurting people. Or I hope so. Let me know if I'm wrong though so I can adjust. I ain't trying to hurt really anything
jtkpqv,gc6vmnb,,damn that‚Äôs so disrespectful, as if that gave her the excuse to just silently walk away. like, at least make up a reason to be a bitch
jtkpqv,,gc6vvxs,It's just funny. People have this weird unspoken view that homeless people just don't go to restaurants lol like wtf am I suppose to do build a fire in the parking lot and cook my feet.
jtkpqv,,gc7h5k9,"Cook my feet" had me laughing pretty hard. They'd probably be pretty tough.

jt44g7,,gdzjbu6,ZZ TOP!
jt44g7,,gc9d3gi,If you look at the measure of truth behind it. A sharp dressed man: fashionable, new , well fitting, often custom made or fitted suit. Cost money, lots of money, these clothes aren't off the rack at Walmart.  Shows a mans' concern about appearances. Also shows wealth. Now my ma used to say to young girls " It's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as a poor man, so pick a rich man." If as a man you scoped out a decked out women in fine clothes and jewery you think money and good looks. So, it's a two way street. Money can't buy love, but it WILL buy a date, a good time, and even a marriage.

jt44g7,,gc5m19d,What a comment. Yeesh.
jt44g7,gc4zazb,,I've dressed moderately decent and have always managed to have a job, so yes, it's pretty much a staple.
jt44g7,gc92upg,,Great story. Solid advice
jt7c3m,gc4552h,,Canadian. My sister is homeless, so I would answer for her:  1. Is there theft among the homeless? (She wouldn't know, but from what I've read yes. I don't know if homeless people are more likely to be robbed by the homeless than other people are likely to be robbed by other people, as getting statistics on this is difficult, but a homeless person cannot weather being robbed the way a housed person could. If I were robbed of someone worth a month's income I would have to dip into my emergency fund. If a homeless person is robbed of that amount of money it's likely everything they own.) 2. How much education did you receive in your life? (She has a law degree) 3. how much does the family home and childhood factor into it? (Some families are abusive so the homeless person leaves. Some support each other, some don't. Some get sick and tired of supporting someone after a time, especially if the soon-to-be-homeless person has an addiction. Some homeless people cut themselves off for reasons that aren't their family's fault. In her case, familial conflict is a factor, but she had lived by herself for some years, working, before she became too sick to work. The conflict, plus literal lack of space, means we can't bring her in.) 4. In the Uk, in my hometown, the church has a very strong connection to the homeless and they help quite a few out of poverty, or so I'm told by my mother. Is this common? (I couldn't get this info from her, but I doubt the churches have enough resources.) 5. Is there no support from other charities, not to just give you soup but get you out of poverty? (Yes, but they're overwhelmed. It's not an unwillingness to help, but an inability. Where I live, rent banks will not help people on welfare, because welfare has its own policies to help with rental deposits. There's also a wide variety of such places and it's hard to get info on them. Even if you get in touch with one, you may have to wait months before you get any help. Some of these places are quite bureaucratic, so you have to talk to them over the phone or meet with them regularly. This is not helpful if you don't have a phone or lack mobility.) 6. I imagine myself sometimes seeing homeless people with I-phones when walking? How is this possible that some homeless people are more homeless than others? (For the first, they may have had the phone before they became homeless. While an iphone is basically a luxury compared to a cheaper smartphone, it's a hassle to port everything to another phone, and that's assuming the person is somewhat computer-literate or smartphone-literate. Having a phone and computer-like object is critical in the 21st Century. My sister is able to pay her phone bill. For the second, some homeless people work, or are on welfare or disability. Some have no income at all other than perhaps begging. The welfare system takes only a little effort to stay within but someone with severe mental health issues cannot manage that. Some homeless people have assets, such as money in a bank account, a car, etc, although these can dwindle or be lost through theft or fraud. Some don't have ID, and if you ever lose that getting new ID is extraordinarily difficult, sometimes impossible, and you need that for a job, welfare, etc.) 6. what percentage of homeless people have criminal records? How many people become homeless because of their criminal record? (I doubt anyone was made homeless **directly** through a criminal record, but for obvious reasons it's harder to get a decent job with a record. Not applicable in her case.) 7. (I'm sorry) If every homeless person made a plan and really followed it. (take the psychology/mental game out of it. Assume you work and sleep without thinking of relapsing) What percentage of homeless people could make it out of poverty/(homelessness?)? Too many factors. Many homeless people are on welfare or disability, and might "make it" if they are willing to have a roommate and can find cheap enough housing, which is very rare. The same cities that attract the homeless are also typically expensive. If the person in question has some more powerful barrier (language barrier, mental health issues, addiction issues) then getting off the streets might be impossible. Some homeless people are actively working but simply don't bring in enough money to afford housing, and they can't move to a cheaper place because there are no suitable jobs there. My sister has a mental health issue and doesn't plan well anymore; she does not bring in enough income to rent a "reasonable" place and will not rent a cheaper place. She also doesn't get along with anyone she lives with, at least not since her mental health issues became worse. 7. is the shortage of jobs or not getting accepted by employers the issue when trying to get a job? Would increasing the jobs available really do anything against homelessness figures? (There is a shortage of low-skilled jobs, which also don't pay enough for housing in many areas. Unfortunately you cannot just "create jobs" as businesses need to at least break even, and employees are an expense. The meme of bad bosses is just a meme: while large businesses that generate a profit could do more, many small businesspeople don't actually make much money once they've paid their expenses. My sister is too disabled to work now.) 8. how many homeless people are foreigners? Do people arrive in the UK and are forced to the streets? (Being a foreigner is a barrier, due to racism, language barriers, credentials not being recognized, etc. Not relevant in my sister's case.) 9. What drugs to homeless people resort to most often and why?(I don't even know why I want to know this one?) Addiction is one frequent cause of homelessness, but often the addiction is just to alcohol. The answer could be any drug, and I'm not sure if homelessness caused by addiction to cocaine is that different from homelessness caused by addiction to heroin. This kind of topic is better addressed *before* someone becomes homeless. Alcohol in my sister's case. 10. How much of homelessness is due to mental reasons( I don't mean mental conditions I mean anything psychological)? (Sometimes not at all. Sometimes it's literally bad luck, or a physical disability that restricts income to welfare or disability payments. On the other hand, a mental health condition could be rendered the homeless person homeless and also prevents them from getting out of homelessness.) 11. How much did your upbringing result in you becoming homeless? (She blames her mental health issues on her upbringing.) 12. How do you cook food? Do you eat hot food? are you allowed to make fires? (Where we live, food is readily available. She has no problems with food.) 13. How easy is it to find shelter? (It is not easy to find good shelters, especially for single males with addiction problems. It is relatively easy for a single abused woman with one or more children to find shelter, but the quality is not good. An abused person with children needs more support, so they get more support.) 14. Why do I so rarely see homeless people that are female? Do people care less about men? Do female homeless people ever get picked up and..sort of go into relationships just to avoid being homeless? (these are theories and I'm expecting to be proven very wrong) (Bunches of reasons. Homelessness is not safe, and women on the street are more vulnerable. They are more likely to get into shelter due to greater need, more likely to find sympathy from friends or relatives, have more options even though living with an abuser is a **bad** option, and in general fewer women have problems with illegal drugs addictions. Many homeless women have children, and children on the street is the worst possible situation: between the greater availability of help and the streets being even worse for children than adults, homeless parents should be relatively rare. Of course, there are certainly homeless children who are technically homeless, living in vans, or being kept in hidden places outdoors because they're just too vulnerable.) 15. How much of being homeless has to do with self-control? Are you more prone to give in to your urges? is that a thing? (Some people have poor impulse control, which can hurt finances, but many homeless people cannot save money because reasonable expenses are higher than their income. Not that big an issue in her case, but I know one person who is on the verge of homelessness because he spends money extremely unwisely.)
jt7c3m,gc4ew7g,,For what it's worth.  1.

jsz8ep,gc2km37,,Honestly he prolly doesn't want all that stuff. Haircut etc... but he would appreciate most if you were just interested in what he usually does day to day and how he lives. Go there looking forward to experience his lifestyle let him guide you thru his life. Handle as much as you can, you can have your own hotel room, invite him if he wants but dont push it on him. I would had loved if my mom came out to visit me.
jsz8ep,,gc5lkuw,Thank you for your reply. Interested in them and their life is exactly what I'm trying to do.

jsz8ep,gc2sjaa,,Your love is just as valuable as cash. If someone offered me $20 or a hug and 15 minutes of conversation, I would choose the later hands down.

jsz8ep,,gc5m0yh,Thank you for your reply. I appreciate this perspective. Hugs and conversation are definitely part of the plan.
jsnaji,gc1l2w3,,Americans (which I am) where raised on the bullshit idea of the American Dream. To steal a quote and paraphrase it "Poor Americans see themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires". Its sad.  Nobody succeeded on their own. It takes the strength of the entire community. It makes me sad my countrymen will go against their best interest over and ideal they will never accomplish. It embarrasses me that they will hurt themselves to help others.  The same argument applies to healthcare and any other social service. It's twisted, cruel, and evil. It is also ignorant.
jsnaji,,gc1nc63,It embarrasses me that they will hurt themselves to HURT* others. That's what's really happening. They're paying a premium for others to suffer.
jsnaji,,gc1vw6f,I see them as brainwashed. That doesn't change anything.  I think its easier to blame oneself than society as a whole. Easier to look at ones failure and say "thats it". It means greater control.  Its sad.
jsnaji,gc0yayv,,People are seriously twisted. What human being wants another human being to freeze and be left outside? Use my tax money, gov, please. We waste so much damn money in the US on bombing people (including innocents). We need to put money into saving people rather than killing people.
jsnaji,,gc2hb4u,There are some sick people in this world.
jsnaji,,gc3yp3a,agreed
jsnaji,gc0dc06,,If you can't appeal to their hearts, appeal to their pocketbook. I watched a city that had a homeless problem build a multimillion.dollar shelter which, at best, was a temporary type measure. I calculated the cost per person.  1. The max number of people allowed in the shelter instead bought a mobile home (not a 5th wheel trailer) per person would have been 1/4th the price. 2. After building the shelter there was a large continous cost to maintain  staff, and run. A mobile home would be a one shot deal.  3. The mobile homes would produce increased employment therefore creating a service increase  thus more employment. 4 The mobile homes got to have land & utilities thus increasing tax revenue. 5. The increase in home ownership creates the need for more local based businesses. thus more employment and a shot to the local ecomomy in general. 6. A larger labor force is created, and since housing cost is very minimal, employees can hire at low wages, thus creating more profit.
jsnaji,,gc2tplr,I will say that when I was homeless I quickly learned the whole ‚Äúget a job‚Äù sentiment was basically impossible. Without a place to charge a phone, take a shower, wash/keep clean clothes, I could not find a job to save my life. I ended up going to a rehab program just to get off the streets because after 3 months in the program you could live there cheap and look for a job. It was a much better prospect than the streets but also was a waiting list for that‚Äîthank god I got in and off the streets. It was miserable. My heart goes out to everybody still out there. So many good people often looked as a subhuman. I remember reading some quote years ago and it went something like ‚Äúwhen judging a society/country, don‚Äôt look at how the gov treats the best/richest, look at how they treat the worst/poorest‚Äù.
jsnaji,,gc32cnz,Yep. It's hard to explain to most people the obstacles to employment when homeless.  1. No phone or computer. I can't contact employers easily and employers have absolutely no way to contact me. 2. Often no bank account because no address. 3. Often no bank account because no ID 4. No ID because no money 5. Nowhere to clean myself until I am presentable 6. No way to afford presentable clothes and keep them unwrinkled and clean 7. Even if I do magically get a job, I will be dedicating 40 hours a week to earnings that I won't see for a minimum of 2 weeks and possibly a month (if paycheques are paid bimonthly). 8. This time can't be spent doing odd jobs or acquiring immediate cash to take care of one's immediate needs 9. If you are a drug addict or an alcoholic, there is a close to 0 chance of you getting clean on the streets  10. If you are a drug addict or an alcoholic, there is a close to 0 chance of you finding somewhere safe to live while you get off them 11. If you do find a detox, there is a close to 100% chance that it is short term and doesn't possess adequate follow up care and counselling. 12. If you don't have family, you don't have help. Period. 13. You can't get mail because you have no address, you can't get an address because you don't have money, you can't get money because you don't have a bank account, you can't get a bank account if you don't have an address.  I'm sure any person in this community could rattle off 100 more and there's many with unique situations that make everything 10x more difficult.  "Get a job" or "move somewhere cheaper" or "quit drugs/alcohol/cigarettes" is not advice, it is a way to pretend like every homeless person is homeless due to their own lack of effort.
jsnaji,,gc1n1mj,I understand your points and agree with most of what you said, but if you were to provide mobile homes that is not a one time cost. There are maintenance and upkeep costs associated with all types of housing. It would be less than maintaining a shelter, but not insignificant.   Most communities need more affordable housing, but if it's not maintained the Karens of the world will come out in force and say See! We can't have these people in our neighborhood.
jsnaji,,gc1o39r,Once again for the money changers. The owners enslaved to the greedy bank board, have to maintain. Just as all home mortage payees are required. Thus increasing the big box home improvement profits and creating jobs in the remodling sector with profits and  taxes. This is true if your house is a $20,000 120 year old fishermans shanty or a million dollar plus McMansion.
jsnaji,,gc1ys0q,How do the homeless maintain a mobile home? It costs money to maintain a house. If they had money they wouldn't need a free home. The government maintains the home? Ok. We have those with buildings not mobile homes. They get trashed and are horrible places to live. Why would your idea be any different?   Also I've lived in a mobile home. If the state would give me a free mobile home in a safe and secure location why would I buy a house? I'd just take a free mobile home. So now the government gives everyone free housing?   A free mobile home for every citizen.   Yeah we don't even offer healthcare.  The homeless aren't getting free mobile homes.   Dream on.
jsnaji,,gc30gio,Read any of the articles. This is all addressed.  Welfare is offered to people that don't work. If your logic was correct, everybody would quit their jobs and live on 430 a month. It won't happen because believe it or not, people don't want to live in abject poverty by choice.
jsnaji,,gc3rhn7,I am not saying free housing wouldn't work as much as I am saying safe, secure, clean, free housing won't work.  I don't see our government buying or building enough houses/mobile homes for everyone to get that type of free housing. Why do you want to put the homeless in hovels?  And face it know it or not you argued for my point. If the housing was decent and safe and clean and free everyone would want it.  If it is unsafe and dirty and hazardous then it's ok for the homeless right?   Because you are correct. I worked like hell to get off of welfare and be housing and food secure. No one wants to live on $800 a month, which is what California gave me for two kids and I in the 1980s. No one wants to see their yard through the wall when taking a shower.   But if California had given me safe, secure, free housing and enough food stamps to not worry, 800 on top of that as household goods money and guaranteed I could have free food and housing and money even after my kids grew up and left I wouldn't have fought so hard to get off welfare.   Poverty is insidious. You get used to it. Two major reasons to better oneself are food and housing. Make those incentives free and who is going to do fast food or maid work?   We need to make minimum wage a living wage. We need to provide training and housing so people can better themselves. We need to get mentally ill people help and drug addicts need help as well.  Some people will never be productive citizens because their mental illness or addiction can't be controlled or they are too disabled to work. Those are the people who should get free housing and it should be safe and secure and free to live in. Everyone should not be given free housing because the type of free housing they would get is what no one would want. We proved that with public housing.  Edited to add I have now read all of your articles. Most deal with Canada or the United Kingdom. The Mother Jones article is based on America and it even states what I am stating.   Ending homelessness for long time chronic homeless with mental health and drug addiction must be done with free housing. I agree.    We still need a living wage and affordable housing for everyone else.
jsnaji,,gc0fvr3,I agree wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, if somebody doesn't agree on principle, they will pretend that they don't agree based on logic. When you work past the broken logic, it just becomes insults or anecdotes about somebody's addict brother or alcoholic sister or thief cousin... Not sure why I bother sometimes.
jsnaji,gc1tof1,,I‚Äôm sorry, we don‚Äôt all think like this down here. Affordable housing is such an issue in a lot of places like LA, Portland, etc. You hear the same things over and over, ‚Äúthey should just go get a job‚Äù, and where are they to take a shower and get cleaned up to nail the interview. ‚ÄúThey chose to live that way‚Äù, maybe some, but most have no where to go. And my personal favorite, ‚Äúif (insert city) is so expensive, then just move to another city‚Äù, this is the best ya got? You think that if they could afford to MOVE TO ANOTHER CITY, that they could probably afford an apartment? This whole gotta get mine screw you in the process mentality is the whole reason we are showing our asses here in the states. Disgusting.
jsnaji,gc08s41,,Of course they are cruel. They enjoy being cruel. This is called sadism. Trying to reason with people who get emotional satisfaction from the pain of others is a fool's errand.   Always remember that for most people "reason" is just a means to cover their tracks. The tracks leading straight to hell.
jsnaji,,gc09wyo,I was very taken aback when somebody who claimed to have been homeless for almost a decade themselves was against it even with the cost saving in mind. It's frustrating to hear it from everyday people, it's infuriating to see it in this community.
jsnaji,gc0dhy6,,Dude's obviously a troll. I don't think anyone on this sub would argue in good faith against housing solutions for the homeless. Great post though, and thank you for the informative links - I've saved these to share for the inevitable threads on popular where NIMBY shitheads and anti-homeless shills rear their ugly heads.
jsnaji,,gc0fmrz,I figured he was a troll but went through his recent posts and it was all anti-mask, anti-lockdown, anti-democrat stuff. For somebody who hates government and unnecessary spending, he sure likes making sure the government can continue spending unnecessarily lol
jsnaji,gc1mc4q,,Once again appeal to the pocket book. These would not be free. They would be bought. Including the land, varing the zoning laws, and so forth to allow quarter lots. A lot is 100 x 100 in most areas. Of course quarter lots would allow 4 units per lot. Most undeveloped lots average $15,000 -20,000. Unless you do in in megacities that are $20,000 per square ft. So then you get 4 for the price of one for all the capitalist profiteers. A small, one bedroom mobile home can be obtained for approx $5000. If bought enmass cost per unit goes down.  If sold per unit and quarter lot cost approx. $10,000. Occupants financed on a 5 year, 60 payment of section 8 average cost to the occupants  $250 per month.  50% profit. Plus taxes incentives, and good guy image should make venture capitalist get a nut. Require a 20% down payment to lessen home insurance cost, and a shot of cash. Are you billionaires drolling yet?
jsnaji,gc299rh,,I am perplexed. Is rereading a less than a postcard long message too difficult?.    1. I said payments from the people living in these units. That means the person pays same as those with a 800 credit rate. Like middle class mortage.  2. Unlike the middle class, this is a 5 year morgage, not a 20 to 30 year morgage for those earning $70,000 + a year.  3. The cost of a section 8 is 30% of income. The average cost is about $250 tops. That is a rent only gig.  4. If done as I suggested, 20% down $2000, saves a ton in the mandatory insurance.  I computed the interest, principal, and insurance . I am talking saving and loan sharking interest not prime rate.  As you pay you build equity, because you will own at the last payment.  5. This is the same price deal my dad bought his house with. A WW2 GI vet loan that was to be paid in 5 years.  Except max was $5000 the cost of that house at the time. Plus low interest rate cause you were a vet  6. This is not a complete cure all but a cost effective and profitable idea.   7. Using stats there are 20% of homelese employed at crap job paying too littlr to rent.  This means the ability to pay, and ideally help at least 20%.  8. If you have been homeless for a least a couple of monthes you KNOW at least 50% of the homeless get checks. Nut checks is what most of the receavers call them. Not to say they won't drink/drug every penny. However the possiblity for another 50% buying a home with this plan is there. IF THEY CHOOSE.  So this is hoping and praying and rolling up your shelves to help, good Lord willing, 3/4ths of homeless.
jsnaji,,gc31abg,All good points but I believe you meant to reply to mr anti-progress on your other comment.  It's funny that the people in here that disagree are literally arguing the same points I've gone over in the OP. It is extremely obvious that many of them haven't chosen to read a single article.  Then there's the people saying "durrr well if ya give homeless people the bare minimum to survive on in the form of shelter, then EVERYBODY WILL QUIT THEIR JOB AND BE HOMELESS!"  Yeah right. If that's your idea of living, go for it. There's a reason the majority of the people in developed countries don't sit around on welfare. People want to live, not just survive. When people complain about stuff like this and say it makes it too easy, I suggest they go give it a try.   Doesn't matter anyways. They don't care to listen or think.   Thanks for the ideas you've contributed to this thread. I really hope that somebody is able to take some info from here and put it to good use. I got clean from heroin June 28th and have been petitioning my city and MPs (with astounding support) to raise these issues to the federal government and get the OK to go forward.  There is no arguing with the fact that it costs too much money keeping people homeless. There is no arguing that the humane thing to do is also the most fiscally responsible.
jsnaji,gc3gxwi,,I actually read an article on CNN abt wheels for change and I came up with a plan for instituting a similar city sponsored program here in Madison WI. I plan to bring it up in a city council budget meeting later this week!
jsnaji,,gc3k5ta,I have had a ton of success moving the idea around my local government! People don't realize the influence they could have if they engaged with government. Unfortunately, many city governments drag their feet whenever they are threatened with work and some simply don't listen.  So good luck! Thanks for making change for the better for the homeless, the housed, and the taxpayers in your community.
jsnaji,gcrn2zk,,It's the association of homelessness with criminality. People still believe that homeless are criminals or violently mentally ill. With education this belief within the public might be overturned but we have a long way to go before it's dispelled.
jsnaji,gdsgh2r,,I didn't know that homeless Canadians have the option to have a hotel room paid for and that honestly makes me so happy. When it starts to get cold I feel so so awful for people who are homeless or facing homelessness. Serious question, aside from personally housing people (I would but not during a pandemic), what can I do to help?
jsnaji,,gdsmh7a,Yep! It's something new Canada is doing specifically for the pandemic. They will be removed eventually but I hope there is a new system in place. There's 10x the people on the streets this year than in years past in my city. Mother's bringing their children out to panhandle. I figured many of them were scammers until I saw how close they were with the local homeless population. These families are sleeping in fucking staircases and in tents when it's -10c outside in an attempt to avoid catching covid at the hotels.  That would be a better question directed towards somebody in outreach. Good question though. I'd say the #1 thing you can do that myself and members in my community have done is go to municipal council meetings and bring up issues that concern you. Do it every week if you have the time and the means. Show them solutions that were effective in other places.  If they don't listen, that's the problem. It's very hard to vote out incompetent members of city council's because there is low info on municipal election candidates. Not sure how to change it. We live in an age where there is 0 incentive to listen to your constituents and 1 million incentives to listen to lobbyists.
jsnaji,,gdt79za,Great information thank you <3
jsnaji,gc378ji,,1st world homelessness is more likely than not to be due to poor choices, I am sick of paying for everyone else's fuck ups, i barely can take care of my own. God i can't believe my parents was right about everything!
jsnaji,,gc3bv99,You're objectively wrong.  If you read any of the post or the sources provided, you'll realize that housing the homeless SAVES money. It is true in America. It is true in Canada. It is true throughout Europe.  Whether homelessness is due to selfish choices, fuck ups, drugs, criminal history, or due to completely out of ones control circumstances, it is costing you more money to maintain your "fuck the poor" attitude than it would be to house them.
jsnaji,,gc3gd9x,I generally agree with you when it comes to housing the homeless that's really a no brainier issue in my opinion, I just also think this is a complicated issue where the solution you offered might not work everywhere that it can be applied. Like for example if we look towards California there's some areas that have a high influx of people regardless of the homeless population but not much job growth, so while housing the homeless can be a given in the general area I'm not quite sure what could be done on the job front without just simply making things worse off for everyone in general. This also isn't even considering that the business that have had to close because of the actions of some homeless people, I'm not trying to insult homeless people when I say that I'm just bringing it up as a factor.  If anything the biggest hurdles to get past in my opinion is the issue of funding programs that do next to nothing as I'm sure you know, and again the general growth of jobs for the general work force. If we can somehow get things in a better place when it comes to these two things there's not much people can say that would against housing the homeless.  Random Edit: Also just one more small bit if you don't mind me saying, when it comes to studies on what programs that work I'd say it might be best to take some of them depending on the context with a grain of tiny salt. Like for example there's plenty of studies that will show you the needles that California hands out do help stop the spread of disease, but little to none of them will tell you that the clean up of said needles is predominantly done as a community service. So without that last factor it'd be easy enough to argue that over a length of time the program could simply just lead to a higher spread of disease.
jsnaji,,gc3hb0z,Okay, I misunderstood what you were saying. That is a very interesting thought I hadn't considered. We have the same phenomenon on the downtown Eastside of Vancouver. Homeless flock because of the weather, the sights, the drugs. There is a higher concentration and maybe housing should be offered outside the city or in areas where they are more manageable.  That's interesting and I'd be curious to see what governments eventually come up with.
jsnaji,,gc3iznp,It would certainly need to be policed regardless of where it's placed to say the least, that's of course not me trying to insult people just for being homeless of course but those that would just be looking to make it worse by stealing and the like from others in the same situation. Honestly it truly just seems like it's an easy enough situation to fix on paper, but there's just so many different variables which makes the issue endlessly complicated.  That's not to say there isn't incompetence at a governmental level when it comes to dealing with the issues as there certainly is of course.
jsnaji,gc1djq4,,Americans have this problem where they think cruelty is a sign of intelligence
jsnaji,gc1i6to,,Agreed! Wonderful post! Lots of great ideas here!
jsnaji,gc3lcqx,,No, its not cruel. It's realistic. Sure, I think everyone should be housed. But, there are those out there that wouldnt know how to be housed, even if it was offered to them for free. They don't have the mindset anymore. They are more comfortable being outside. There are alot of them that just have lost touch with reality so much, for whatever reasons, that they don't seek to be housed anymore. What are you gonna do? Confine them to their new free homes?   Its just not realistic. Homelessness will exist as long as there is a human species on this planet. Yes, we should reach and house those that need it, and want it. Yes, children and their struggling mothers shouldn't be sleeping in their cars. Yes to all of the above. But we cannot realistically eradicate homelessness.
jsnaji,,gc71yak,[deleted]
jsnaji,,gc7e1qg,Not at all. I lived every word I said.
jsnaji,gc18kcn,,The problem I believe is this. People who pay rent or mortgages would be jealous homeless people would get free housing. The whole we work hard to live well and you just gonna them free stuff routine.  Its sad.
jsnaji,,gc1n9dy,Why would someone be jealous over shitty, crowded trailers. That's like being jealous of people in trailer parks because their rent is dirt cheap and you're paying an expensive mortgage.
jsnaji,,gc1oc6o,I agree. The same thing goes with welfare. If you really think getting paid $470 a month is "living" then go ahead and quit your job. People like to complain about the 'free ride' given to others even though you couldn't pay these people to live in welfare-like-conditions.
jsnaji,,gc1bc7t,It's that mindset that's holding us back from evolving as a country. It's not that we don't have the resources, (we're the richest country on earth, money ain't a problem), it's because we don't want to. A false meritocratic narrative pushed by the right wing and the wealthy.
jsnaji,,gc1baff,Then wouldn't a easier option be become sentient like some other humans here on earth and stop working?
jsnaji,gc36rvg,, there is a big difference in being 1st world homless and 3rd world homless.
js1i0i,gbxf95u,,Oddy enough,  many very poor underdevoped countries allow people to build their own homes. Now by our high standards they may seem like shanties and shacks. However if one would look next to our southern border, TX is a good example, you see colonies of people living in houses build from old wood folding garage doors sured up with timbers. This practice was halted but the existing ones were allowed to continue. These have 3rd world conditions with no indoor plumbing, using outhouses and often cooking over open fires. I am not saying that homeless should live under circumstances. However this is necessaty being the mother of invention. With guidance from those retired from the building trades very cheap housing far more livable can be built by the homelesd for the homeless. Not to.mention many of the old abandants houses in cities could be rehabed enough to live in using homeless to fix up their own dwellings.
js1i0i,,gbxkwm6,our red tape loving system disadvantages anyone who is in the 60% lowest income percentile. Or, more then half of America. want a home?    Too bad, you need a down payment you can‚Äôt save up since you pay rent.   Want a company?

js1i0i,gbybyqe,,Yep. We ALL make poor decisions at some point in our life, and you never know another‚Äôs experience until you walk in their shoes. I work in social services, and the stories of trauma for some of the clients are horrific and affect every area of their lives-including decision making.  Also, housing everyone-regardless of their past or current life choices-saves the public money by reducing ER visits, police intervention, and court/prison costs. It also increases public safety and reduces some kinds of crime. Housing first=win-win for everyone.

js1i0i,gby3uzu,,This is something i have to disagree with.  You cant lump all homeless folks into one basket, the world doesnt work like that and neither does any economy or enviornment.  You cannot put the homeless mother and her children in a barracks type arrangement or a community living situation where the only thing separating them and other people is a sheet or some kind of permiable structure.   You also cant stick a lot of homeless together due to their *personal belief systems, reasons for being there and personality types*. You cant have a mentally ill homeless person that refuaes to take medication for whatever reason, housed with others.... Especially if they have violent tendencies or rely on illegal susbtances to medicate themselves.   Plus, I'll go ahead and take the complete asshole route and ask who is going to fund the grocery and electric bills, building material costs, land and property insurance and taxes, funding for educational programs to retrain these people so they can find jobs and get into helpful programs, and most of all who is going to police these little neighborhoods or homes that have most likely a migrant homeless population?   The entire world is based of greed, gluttony and selfishness. Plus, right now, being homeless myself, i would absolutely refuse one of these little homes due to the fact that i know i can get back on my own two feet with the bare minimum or no help at all, and would rather do it that way than live off everyone elses pity drenched hand outs.

js1i0i,gbxpun0,,This would be common sense in a Communist/Socialist Country. The problem is when you try to inject this idea in a Capitalist/Far Right political regime.   Capitalistic countries are designed for us to compete within eachother, and by that competition gain and gain Money and resources with the goal of acquiring a private property or renting a place to improve the economy of the country by taxing.    This is impossible and frowned upon on any Far Right Regime and it threatens to disestablish that social system because the "competition" "gaining resources" system would have no validation

js1i0i,gbz93qc,,I really disagree with this post most of the homeless who have done it to themselves They either drink or do drugs or constantly become a menace I've only met a very select few homeless people that are actually working their way up to get out of the situation by themselves because the resources are so stretched thin  Because the addicks need more help or the ones that have kids need more help I don't believe If you have a poor me attitude and you constantly make horrible decisions you should get free housing I see people constantly That sit around all day drinking and smoking and celebrating their failures and though the ones that get everything handed to themThe people who do it to themselves should be forced to get out of it themselves   90 percent of my problems come from other homeless people they may have mental problems They may have addiction problems but God helps those who help themselves and it isn't the land of the free shit    Also it infuriates me that I've been on the streets for 3 years and I hardly get any help that I have to do it all on my own while an addict that they say is suffering is always getting bumped to the top of the less because they can have them OD on the sidewalk I didn't do it to myself I never had an issue with drugs never had an issue with alcohol never really had an issue with mental health although than having to deal with the crazy people on the streets that make you wanna murder them I had any eviction  So yeah it makes me really angry when every everyone says everyone should get housing no matter if they didn't do it to themselves or if they did because  And this is why societee doesn't  Propel forward because we keep rewarding horrible behavior And before anybody gives me the whole spiel of its addiction they chose to make the initial choice to put it in their arm or to sniff it  And one more instance I've even seen pedophiles get housing quicker then people will haven't done it to themselves and just fell on hard times because it's a mental illness So they say These are the types of people that get itThe ones that you can't have your kids around the sekko's the ones who did do it to themselves
js1i0i,,gbzxw7c,For what it's worth. By building or rehabbing as I suggested, this has a multi facet approach.  1. You have to buy the material. This is a put your money where you mouth is deal. If your money goes to a stem or jug. You' ve made your choice.  2. If you are too lazy to even help hold a tape measure, hand over a hammer, or sit on a board being cut, then you'll never be able to keep the place up. Go sleep under a bridge.  3. If you are so brain dead by booze/dope to even understand you are learning a skill by doing this, fine. Go droll in the corner.  What I suggest is a hand up not a hand out. If you don't want to grab an offered lifeline, then drown.    On a limited very small scale I workec with some groups around the country that did just what I am talking about. It workec altho not always hiw was planned.
js1i0i,,gbzyir5,Yes I agree hand up but my problem is alot of places that offer service just enable  its like being homless your always the victim and yes being homless its shit but life is rough dose not mean you get to have the world just bc of a bad choice people will never learn if they never struggle or try to be stong

jrnke9,gbuyygr,,Not currently homeless.  But I did once have a really cool experience with some Sikh people at a rest area. We were living in a van for a while, driving to California from Washington. They saw me and my partner counting change to buy coffee from a vending machine.  A man next to us realized that the machine's bill reader was broken so we gave him some of our change to buy a coffee.  He was thankful.  Turns out he was the driver of a bus and on that day had been hired to drive a Sikh group to an event and back.  They were finishing up a big meal at the tables in the rest area.  They invited us to come eat with them and insisted that we take trays of leftover food with us so they did not have to travel back with it.  Samosas, lentils, sweet breads, and more.  It was so much food that we had to give some away to another homeless man that we met later when we stopped for gas.  Those kind people gave me a little comfort during a rough transitional time for me.  Wherever those people are at in the world right now, big respect.

jrbp0x,,gbtcx90,Critique on the bag.  No matter what else, its rated at -20 below zero. That offsets everything else when you are camping inside a refrigerator freezer.  14 pounds!  Puts the heavy in heavy duty. Not for backpacking.  'Ventilation'. See the all around zipper at the top? Need that when you're roasting. The trade off with very cold rated bags, they trap your heat that builds until you're uncomfortable, so you 'ventilate', and get cold again. All night long, hot cold, hot cold. I used to have a semi mummy with a draw string at the head . I could pull it shut until there was just a hole to breathe thru. So you're like warm and toasty except for those icy breaths you draw into your lungs.  Or you close up completely to warm the interior of the bag with your breath and become short of breath . Like swimming under water; hold your breath, come up for air, repeat.  No matter how warm it is in your bag you still see your breath in the car compartment. If you have to get up and go pee it gets shivery . You jump out and dance then return to your 'snug as bug' cocoon.  $200 Solariums is worth it, because even though you aren't as comfortable as actually living inside a temperature controlled building with a heater and thermostats, its better than freezing.  yah yah I now you can run the engine too. Kinda defeats the 'sleeping in your vehicle in the city limits' / camping / homeless (anti poor) Statute Ordnance Clause. Cops go by in their patrol car and see your vehicle exhaust.  90 inch length. So you don't have to pupate in a fetal position to get all of you warm. So many bags are too short for taller people. Can't 'stretch out' while you sleep.  Wide bottomed too. Mummy or semi mummy makes you feel like your feet are tied together.  The 6 pounds of loft is what takes it over the top for cold rating. Thickness of insulation above and below  is what traps your heat and keeps you warmer. Down bags crush flat beneath your body weight. Down also is slow to dry if it gets wet from condensation inside vehicle compartment, for instance. Down loses its thermal properties when wet.  Nice.  Makes it worth dropping the Winter Coin.

The weather isn't so cold, just rains all the damn time. Plus there are lots of homeless there (as far as Canadian homeless). So lots of handouts. But be careful also, many of Vancouvers' bums are damn junkies. They are like the walking dead ready to eat up newbies. There are left over hippie types there also. So its' good and its' bad.

jqsx89,gbp73yc,,I left home at 15 because of crap. I am a yank so things are a bit different, plus this was.50+ years ago. To look older I grew a beard. I got jobs cause I was underage and you didn't have to pay minimum wage to people under 18. Now days  and in Canada I don't know about that. I do know that I got hired at less than Canadas' minimum wage up there so the guy wouldn't have to report me as an employee up there, and paid me cash anyway. You are hauling around a lot of stuff I wouldn't like the electronics except maybe a cell phone. Which can be used to track people by the way. I would just sell the extra stuff for cash. If you camp out a lot and camp cook you do OK, for a while, but you will have to beg, borrow, steal, or work  for more money. I am going to guess 1. you get tired of this life and go back home. OR 2. Get good at it and travel the Big Lonely as the old hobos called Canada.
jqsx89,,gbp7ph8,Growing a beard sounds like a great idea. Fof the laptop, why would it be a bad idea to keep it? Is it just because its fragile or something? Also what kinds of things do you think I'd need? I forgot to include that I had a small cot that folds up into about 5" x 6" x 12". Do you think it's a good idea to keep that or would it be better off sleeping on a bench or something else that keeps me off the ground?   I'm already tired of this life haha, but I'm almost certain that I'm not welcome back at home. Browsing craigslist I found an ad for a spare room in someones house for $280 a month. Pretty good fuckin deal and I'm so grateful I found it. But on the other hand it seems too good to be true. Have you ever found a deal like this that turned out fine, or have they always been shady? Thanks for the tips by the way, I really appreciate them.
jqsx89,,gbpf051,The original commenter probably means it‚Äôs not a good idea to carry the laptop around because it‚Äôll be one more thing that can get stolen.  Either someone will try when you‚Äôre sleeping or will see you walking around with it and try to rob you then.  It‚Äôs like an extra target on your back for anyone that‚Äôs desperate for money.  OTOH, if you‚Äôre able to secure lodging (room that‚Äôs indoors not just a tent), keeping the laptop could be helpful with doing some online work (would need wifi) and will provide entertainment. You‚Äôre underage so I‚Äôm sure the online job options would be limited but there‚Äôs subs like r/beermoney that could be a good resource.

jqlt7r,gbovost,,I'd be curious to know how your travels go and what you learn along the way. Will you be keeping us updated in this sub?
jqlt7r,,gbwlpn6,I can if you guys would like to have me do so! I plan on starting a youtube too maybe with it, because in hindsight its pretty unconventional and sure to bring a smile to faces.
jqlt7r,gbo0m0g,,That sounds like a pretty awesome master plan to me. Good luck on your travels!

jq12hn,,gbiskba,Oh yeah true.
jq12hn,gbjfwif,,What I did when I did the whole tent thing was scope out people's discarded sofas. Near the dumpsters of apartments or places like Goodwill. Steal the cushions and put them underneath your tent. It's almost just like sleeping on the couch.
jq12hn,,gbjgcw0,Oh yeah good idea.

I'm in Denver and I've been looking for a tent all day because it's supposed to snow üå®Ô∏è a few days this week and last time I was stuck in the doorway of a hotel building and got kicked out in the middle of the storm with no where to go and just covered myself in a blanket and sat there covered up for hours till it stopped snowing

jq12hn,,gbkbuix,Yes I do have cashapp actually and that would be awesome. Thank u so much.
jq12hn,,gbkc4aa,Okay. I'll let you know tomorrow. I need to get a few things for my tent and maybe a few cans of food then I should have some left.

jq12hn,,gbubg3s,Height?
jq12hn,gbufht6,,Yes your tent has to be like an 8 man tent over 6ft I didn't mean a small dome tent. My apologies for not being clear about that.

jq12hn,,gbkc6lr,But bug spray lol
jq12hn,,gbkd96g,Actually it‚Äôs what I used at my dispensary.  Believe me it really works.  Not just bug spray but hornet or wasp spray.
jq12hn,,gbke0fw,I see.
jq12hn,,gbkg6l3,It works !
jq12hn,,gbv5t8e,Dollar Tree hairspray.  In a pinch uses with a lighter for a blow torch.
jq12hn,,gbz5el8,Yes but if you‚Äôre alone and someone  Comes at you you need something quicker  And a lighter and hair spray would require  Both hands! In an emergency situation  You want one hand free !
jq12hn,,gbz6cpr,Cheap hairspray alone is deadly in the face. Beats pepper spray, can blind some jerk.
jq12hn,gbm3tj0,,I had great success sleeping in/on this bigass parka.  It was thick like carthart and reached below my waist. I‚Äôd fold my sleeping bag over to be double thick, then lie on top zipped up in my parka.  Of course depending on where you are, it might be too cold for you to not be in your sleeping bag,  but I didn‚Äôt see any mention of winter weather. Do you have a place to stash things during the day? Or will you be carrying everything 24-7?  If you have a spot to store things, I can‚Äôt say enough about COUCH CUSHIONS! I had an easy enough time finding those. Decent shape cushions I put under my sleeping bag. Skanky cushions got wrapped in garbage bags first. Really sketchy ones can always go under the tent too. My friend got ahold of a (used) foam mattress topper, mother of god we slept like Kennedy‚Äôs on that thing
jq12hn,gbm8ba3,,Invest in Ozark trail products. They‚Äôre your best friend. I bought a portable solar shower for $5, they also have portable toilets as well as emergency towels for $3, knife for $1, rain poncho for $5, emergency blanket for $3 (foil blanket essentially) but point is Ozark trails is the best, durable products for a cheap price.
jq12hn,gbmrkhq,,You would be amazed at what warmth you get from candles in a tent. Just make sure they are in a class container. Not too many in small tents. And you gotta have some ventilation.  I learned a trick, take an old empty clean paint can. Pull out the cardboard and put the paper roll in the can. Add 70% isopropyl alcohol until the paper is covered. Light it and you have heat for hours. Make sure you have a big enough tent for it. It works!

jo5n6v,gb73lx2,,I like this because when I was a kid there was a park that had an outlet sticking out of the ground in a wooden post right in the middle of the grass. One night we lugged our friends dads old wood panneled tv set down and plunged it in and watched Simpsons on vhs. We felt like kings.
jo5n6v,gb5xaae,,dont share location and keep it for yourself
jo5n6v,,gb647p4,I give the word out to local bums and travellers who pass by. I don't plan on sticking around for long so i don't really care if the spot gets blown up, which is what usually happens unfortunately.
jo5n6v,gb5uyd6,,I would try to get a cheap powerbank somewhere and power up here
jo5n6v,,gb642r0,Been trying to get my hands on one. Or even a Solar charger but too much $$
jo5n6v,,gb69dxj,Be careful with the solar charger. Do your research, I bought one because it was cheap and it's the worst investment I ever made. It takes about 3 hours to get 5 percent charge in my phone while my phone Is off.  Luckily I can still charge it from a USB cable so it's not a total loss.
jo5n6v,,gb7ufjd,Yeah you'll need at least a certain size. And solar power generally has to be used with batteries. i.e., you let the solar panel sit and charge a battery 24/7 and you just use that battery when you need to charge a phone and so on.   Also, solar panels don't need sunlight, they just need light. So  you could set it up near a strong lamp where others won't mess with it.
jo5n6v,,gb7gg21,Jesus....
jo5n6v,,gb5z449,Careful. The more power you tap, the more the meter goes up, the more likely someone will sent around to investigate the drain. Then they'll turn it off or otherwise disable it. Like water faucets on buildings. They take off the valve handle or wire them closed.  I used to carry locking vice grips to deal with that.
jo5n6v,,gb79a3c,All smartphones use up about the  same amount of energy. about **1 kilowatt hour per year**. That‚Äôs equivalent to the amount of power it takes to light a 100-watt light bulb for about five minutes.   There would have to literally be a homeless encampment set up around this one tap for it to become an issue.
jo5n6v,,gb7thqz,The biggest issue would be if someone hooked up some kind of electric heat. Generally anything in that category will draw 1 kw and up.
jo5n6v,,gb7kcaw,Why I said, 'careful'.
jo5n6v,,gcktd6f,That was legit the worst thing when I was homeless. I remember being thirsty af at 3 in the morning and trying to get water and they had taken off the valve handle at the building I used to get it from, so I had to walk another mile to the hospital just to get some.
jo5n6v,,gclpzhz,Imagine that. In the modern world, in built up areas, water pipes, electrical wires and natural gas runs underground everywhere, all over the whole city.  Literally, under our feet, under the concrete and pavement, there is water and electricity everywhere, but **we have to 'walk a mile' for a drink of water.**
jo5n6v,gb603hq,,Nice. Move in.
jo5n6v,gb8wxjg,,Could you take a close up of how you tapped into the line? Is this fairly safe or is there a chance of shock?

jnwoie,gb46v4d,,Best of luck pal, I was in the same position as yourself last year, it was a major shock to my system as well.  Until you find yourself homeless you don't really realize all the small things you took for granted previously are actually rather luxurious and shouldn't be taken for granted.  Hope it all works out for you, am routing for you x
jnwoie,,gb47int,It‚Äôs been tough, but there‚Äôs a part of me that loves the challenge of making it through this struggle. I kind of feel reinvigorated.

jnwoie,gb48nb3,,Bunch of the parks have open bathrooms but it depends where you are, I personally can‚Äôt believe the libraries are still closed I‚Äôm pissed because although I am housed, it cuts down on my freedom

jnwoie,,gb4vg00,Park outside. Starbucks usually has decent enough wifi that you dont need to be inside. I often stop and jump on their wifi for a few minutes. The library where im at has wifi that I just sit outside and use.
jnwoie,,gb4q1ad,Hey...come up to the Catskills, our libraries are open by appt at least! It‚Äôs only 2 hours from you. Stop to sleep at the Liberty McDonald‚Äôs lot...no one bothers you, not even the cops. I sleep there a lot. They have free Wi-Fi too.

jnwoie,gbeszfz,,Sounds like your doing pretty good so far. Check out r/urbancardwellers and van life for info.  My only tip is to get down to the least amount of stuff possible to live. Space is at a premium when your living in a car and having too much takes up too much space, is easy to get disorganized, and cuts down on the MPG.  But you said your doing Uber so you must not have that much stuff. Look into Doordash as well, you don't have to deal with nosy people.

jnl4d8,gb2skp0,,What's the catch? And don't say there isn't one because we all know better.
jnl4d8,,gbeb82r,Hey, theirs no catch. Streets of America Homeless Outreach is on the streets trying to make a difference for our homeless. As a preacher I have a great Love and concern for our homeless. This is why I have been out their for over 30 years feeding, and providing tents, sleeping bags and so much more, but I see many homeless are wanting to step it up to the next level because they don't want to be where they are 5 years from now.   As a preacher I want to be an encourager, not a discourager.   I want more for our homeless and the main area I am shooting for is helping them have that chance and get Off the Streets. Once you become homeless it becomes harder to become Non-Homeless. I have heard it over and over, that all they need is a Hand Up, a second chance. That's it. No catch. I don't beg for people to help this Ministry. Ask yes, Beg No. I learned that this Ministry is not about me. It's about those that I might be able to help. No Catch. Thanks for that great Question and Lord Bless
jnl4d8,,gbecfkn,So you help people who are unable to work? Do you help people that don't want to be sober? Are trans and gay people welcomed and protected from discrimination?
jnl4d8,,gbegj89,As a Preacher I have moral standards I live by. To help someone that cant work is different than someone who wont work, But I try to help both. As for those who want to continue in drugs, they are always going to be there and as a Preacher I minister to them and sometimes you never know when something that is said will help that person. People that want to be Trans or Gay have made a decision I don't have to agree with, and still as a preacher I will minister to them as I would anyone else. Agree with their life style No, Minister to them and let God sort that out, because our conscience will accuse us or excuse us how we live. As far as helping someone off the streets that wants to get back on their feet, I cant stop the process of getting someone off the streets and back to work. If I judged everyone before I helped them I would just go fishing. You cant not try and help someone because they have liqueur on their breath, Or because their hat looks gay, or their skin is different. Its all about caring not compromising. I have strong standards, but I don't push them off on strangers. I let God do the work in their hearts. I'm just trying to be a help, and you can be too. Lord Bless
jnl4d8,,gbeiqy0,Believing that being gay or trans is a choice is bigotry. And knowing people have bigoted feelings towards you is definitely "a catch" when accepting services from them.
jnl4d8,gb5c4tp,,All you have to do is unquestioningly believe in Christ, no arguments, and deal with a rough process. :) :)
jnl4d8,,gbecgmh,Hello I am not quite sure how to respond to that. As a Preacher Jesus Christ is the Captain of My Faith and I am not the Co-Pilot, I leave that to the Holy Spirit.  This is what I try to encourage our homeless with and that is that there is a far better scenario to look at than the position you are in right now. It's by the Grace of God you have not starved or Died of pneumonia. I have had a few of my homeless friends die from sickness out on the streets and I guess that is a motivating factor for me to keep pushing on with getting this Tiny House Community project going.   There are missing faces that should not have had to leave this earth so soon. Living on the streets will end your life sooner than necessary. Thanks for the question and Lord Bless.
jnl4d8,,gbgxwbh,>Hello I am not quite sure how to respond to that. As a Preacher Jesus  Christ is the Captain of My Faith and I am not the Co-Pilot, I leave  that to the Holy Spirit.  Very few pastors or priests understand Christ or the Trinity, but I will attempt to share here, of course, only if you are willing to listen.  First, there are two major ways to understand and take upon Christ. The first is to leave him outward, as the external savior of all sinners, whom we believe and trust in, who came in the person of Christ Jesus. The second is to understand that **you** are Christ, whether a Christ or *the* Christ, and since you are, you should be willing to take the Cross upon your own back, your own being, and be willing to put your life on the line for all people.  For Buddhists, especially us [Bodhisattvas](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/foundations/what-bodhisattva), we put our lives on the line for **all sentient beings**, no exceptions, whether they are human or not. We understand that to become Christ or to become Buddha is to willingly accept the anger, animosity, and hatred, of those living beings who are trapped in a web of hate and delusion, as our own. We, literally and figuratively, accept any whips, any nails in our hands, any pain at all. We will carry our Crosses ourselves for you.  We do not hate; we only love, love these beings and people as dearly as we love our own son or daughter, brother or sister, mother or father. If your child slaps you, you can only look upon him with eyes of kindness. If you can love the one who will beat you to death, with no hate towards him, you have equaled and surpassed Christ, as he has wished. That is the second meaning, the rarer meaning, the unshared meaning, of Christ.  >This is what I try to encourage our homeless with and that is that there  is a far better scenario to look at than the position you are in right  now.  Of course there is. There are heaven realms after death, and many who are poor and only wish for the happiness of others will easily reach them (many rich who do the same as well). Of course, you know that domain, so I will rest here.  >It's by the Grace of God you have not starved or Died of pneumonia.  I love all sentient life. We do not sin, we only love and help others out of their sin. If this body decides to break apart, so it is, but I know, **we** know where we shall be going. Thank you good friend. Onwards:  >I have had a few of my homeless friends die from sickness out on the  streets and I guess that is a motivating factor for me to keep pushing  on with getting this Tiny House Community project going.  Exactly so. It is people like you, who selflessly wish to help people like us that make us not give up on life. Often, there are many out there, who, for donations, respect, or some other impure reason, wish to start something for the homeless, but you, my good friend, have done so out of selflessness, kindness, and compassion. Thus, we see you and adore you, and we know you. Keep at it.  >There are missing faces that should not have had to leave this earth so soon.  Yes, many geniuses and kind people have left, and it is sad and a shame, and most of all, unnecessary. If everyone had a good heart like yourself, perhaps poverty would be gone, no involuntary homelessness would exist.  >Living on the streets will end your life sooner than necessary.  Yes, perhaps so. As it is, I've predicted it will be around 45 when I die in this life, if not sooner.  >Thanks for the question and Lord Bless.  Bless you. May all the angels protect and surround and aide you in your missions. [Metta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.08.than.html) to you! :)
jnl4d8,,gbhqm21,> You quoted: First, there are two major ways to understand and take upon Christ. The first is to leave him outward, as the external savior of all sinners.  Sorry you would do that. Christ must be internal not external. Everything you said after that was Teachings of mans philosophy and not Scripture. I have heard all of what you said before from others I have witnessed to about Jesus Christ. Over 30 Years I have dealt with people on the streets. Jesus Christ is your only hope. Gods Word has declared it whether one believes it or not. I hope you find salvation before its too late.  Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  1 Corinthians 15 1-4 1 ¬∂ Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.   3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:  6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.  7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.  8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.    Till next time.
jnl4d8,,gbhryvv,> Sorry you would do that. Christ must be internal not external.  ? I was listing the two major ways **people** take Christ. I never said I do so myself externally. Christ is both internal and external.  > Everything you said after that was Teachings of mans philosophy and not Scripture.  No, taking the Cross on your back is not mans philosophy. It's understanding the symbolic nature of Jesus in a different light.  > I have heard all of what you said before from others I have witnessed to about Jesus Christ.
jnl4d8,,gbhu5jx,Bear with me, I can see you are frustrated.  > I have heard all of what you said before from others I have witnessed to about Jesus Christ.  That is not possible because very few are at the capacity to understand what I just said, to say nothing of becoming Such. You may have heard a few excepts of what I said, but certainly not that entire message and especially the core portions.  > Over 30 Years I have dealt with people on the streets.  Yes, and time is not a factor of compassion. It comes from the heart not the past. I thank you, of course, for such service, but what does this mean to me exactly?  > Jesus Christ is your only hope.   Buddha is a pretty good option. Unless you can find a flaw in the Blessed One's teachings, which is impossible (years I've searched and cannot), I will stick with Him.  That said, of course I have respect and love for Jesus. He was a pretty cool dude and he took a lot of suffering on his own back. In that, me and Him are alike, as I am willing to endure as well. That is to carry a Cross.  > Gods Word has declared it whether one believes it or not.  Did you know that there are more books of the Bible than what are traditionally printed? Things like the Dead Sea Scrolls shed a very different light and understanding on Christ. The Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary are two good choices you may wish to check into.  > I hope you find salvation before its too late.   I am one of the [Righteous (Luke 5:32)](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Luke-5-32/) the Lord Jesus spoke of. Thus, Christ did not come for me. You know that verse well, I would assume? I am one of the Physicians instead.
jnl4d8,,gbgy9eq,>As a Preacher Jesus Christ is the Captain of My Faith and I am not the Co-Pilot, I leave that to the Holy Spirit.  Ah one more thing. As a Preacher, your aim is to realize and **become** the Trinity yourself; you are to actualize the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, three-in-one. You are the Holy Spirit. You need that to grow to be effective.  When you say leave that to the Holy Spirit, you should realize you are very much part of that Spirit, the same as the rest of us. You need to become the Son to get the message of the Father across, so to speak. For what this is worth. :)
jnl4d8,,gbhnenz,Sorry! You are 100% wrong. you will never become God or a part of Him. The Holy Spirit Dwells in the True believer through Jesus Christ which is part of Gods Trinity. 1John 5:7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  Matthew 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:  (KJV) The Holy Spirit dwells in the believer, and Not the believer as the Spirit. 1Jo 3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.  These are Christians he is talking about. Those that have put their faith and trust in Jesus Christ and "That Finished Work" which is found in   1Corinthians 15:1-4. Its called the Gospel.  I am a trinity but I am not The God Head Trinity. I am body, soul and spirit. God is a Spirit:  John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.  Much more I could say but I think you get the picture that we are not gods nor will we ever be gods. I hope this was helpful. I did not say all this to make you mad, but I hop it helped you a little. Lord Bless
jnl4d8,,gbhpc6t,> Sorry! You are 100% wrong.  If you believe so. You can simply disagree.  > you will never become God or a part of Him. > I am a trinity but I am not The God Head Trinity.  If you lessen yourself to that, so it is, but you cannot speak for my case. I am quite different then.  I am the imperishable and the immortal spoken in 1 Corinthians 15  > Much more I could say but I think you get the picture that we are not gods nor will we ever be gods.  From what would I get that picture?  > I hope this was helpful. I did not say all this to make you mad, but I hop it helped you a little. Lord Bless  I hope what I said previously was helpful. We speak only truth; we are only light. :)
jnl4d8,gb37430,,The best way to help anyone is to hold them accountable.
jnl4d8,,gbedo4x,Hello, I agree that everyone is accountable for whatever it is that they do. We all have made bad decisions in our life and the good thing about the Bad decisions is that we learned by them. Many Homeless made a bad decision and found that it landed them on the Streets. They learned from that bad decision but it does not help him now. Once you are homeless you are stuck until someone is gracious enough to come by and offer that "Hand Up" and not just a "Hand Out".  I'm glad someone was there to help me when I made a bad decision. Yes! you are 100% correct, We are accountable, But we all deserve a second and third chance. This is why I do what I do in helping the Homeless. They need my help but they also need yours as well. Hope this was helpful. Thanks for the Comment and Lord Bless
jnl4d8,,gbf9zai,Most definitely agree!! As someone who has struggled in the worst ways, it wasn‚Äôt until I was held accountable did my life change.   Cps came in and took my kid in 2014. I sat their feeling sorry for myself and ran up a debt to the crack man and being a human garbage can until the codes department condemned my apartment. I moved off to a hotel with my toxic baby daddy that was paid for by the county. After my time expired there I moved to the city park where I lived for a few more months. Of course I had ppl trying to help me. But I chose to sit there and blame the state for my problems.   Thankfully I live in a cold climate and decided to get inside and headed to detox and my first rehab. From there I was returned to the streets while I awaited my bed in a transitional program where thankfully I actually made thanks to the impending cold weather. I moved in and fucked up more times than I changed my underwear. Those case managers really worked with me. Long story I had gotten my son back once the dust settled in 2015. I continued to live in my program with tons of supervision. The program I lived in had a program where they put me to work as an admin assistant in spite of the fact that I barely could turn on a pc. I worked there part time I‚Äôve a year. Not only did I gain valuable work skills but also social skills. After just over a year of working there (and residing in program) I got my taxes and moved out to the suburbs in 2017  Just a few months prior I had met a boyfriend who lived in a similar program for men at an AA meeting (sounds terrible.. lol) however he wanted to move in with me and my kiddo who was 10 at the time. He was a hard worker as a dishwasher at the time.  So we move out of our programs to this tiny little apartment and played house. I no longer had a job as I didn‚Äôt live in my program and that was a requirement due to the grant writing. Thankfully I had a public benefits to supplement our income.   Over the next 2 years we worked whatever jobs available to us. We decided we were in love and wanted to get married . The government told me that I was no longer eligible for my benefits as I was married to a working man. Scared the shit out of me and I got a minimum wage job while I took the free excel and Microsoft classes available in my community.   Then last January I found a job in a corporate company  Monday thru Friday making GREAT money plus amazing benefits !! Can u imagine?   I no longer rely on food stamps, SSI or public health insurance.  I worked on my credit score and got my student loans out of default. Have health,life, renters, auto , legal and disability insurance .  Bought a new car 3 years ago, All because someone held me accountable. But it had to be in my time. So if it had not been for the ppl that held me up when I was failing I would have not ever got to succeed.   Today I donate my time and my money each month to the organization that helped me.  It‚Äôs been an amazing journey!!  Just last month we moved out of that little apartment into a gorgeous 3 bedroom flat in the same little community that I have been a part of almost 4 years. Bought brand new furniture and washer and dryer all because someone loved me when I couldn‚Äôt love myself.  Downright scary when I realize how different it all could have ended for me.
jnl4d8,gccxl30,,u/Preacher-Tom  As someone who has had a deep and intimate connection with God, God has told me that God fully loves and accepts me for all of me including my transgender identity, and in addition God has told me I do not need to accept Jesus Christ as my lord and savior.   (This is in response to some of the comments I have read in this thread)
jnl4d8,gb22bsl,,What are some great ways to help our homeless?  I have given out Tents, Food and Clothes for years but there has to be a solution to getting our homeless neighbors off the streets and back in a home they can call their own as well as having that work income again and feel that since of pride that they accomplished this on their own.
jnl4d8,,gb26waz,I‚Äôm on my way out myself; found a job, the first job that‚Äôs related to my area of expertise too (still gotta interview, but I‚Äôm quite skilled at it and the competition is negligible if at all). And man, if I‚Äôd had assistance finding that job... I‚Äôd already be furiously hacking away at a desk by now.
jnl4d8,,gbe9k49,I Pray you find that right Job. With the homeless we have here, many of them are smart with a good head on their shoulders and not letting the drugs take them over with knocking the edge off trying to forget their issues. That's why I'm trying to help those ones that want it.    I have been Ministering in the streets for over 30 years, trying to help our homeless and poor. This is why I am putting together a Tiny House Community for the Homeless and try and give them that Hand Up. It will take a little time to get it all together, but in the mean time I will continue to be on the streets and be a Help. Pray for this Ministry, and I am Praying for you as well, God Bless.
jnl4d8,,gbea484,I don‚Äôt pray. But I am glad some folks are taking up the initiative. I wish we could standardize a coherent plan for homelessness aside from getting it out of sight.
jnl4d8,,gbeh38m,Homelessness is here to stay, but that's what people are for, and that is, To Help One another. Their is still some kindness left in this world. Lord Bless.
jnl4d8,,gbeas58,You sound like a politician. No offense lol
jnl4d8,,gbegstt,Lord knows I am Not a Politician, I'm too Honest. No Offense taken. and Lord Bless
jnm4ug,gb287mg,,Have you tried getting onto social security disability? Sounds like that would be something you could be eligible for and if you're able to get into a mental health room and board if possible. Just so you can have a place to stay and have money as well. Would be worth looking into at least.
jnm4ug,,gb3sfkd,Thanks for the suggestion. Yeah, it's what I'm on now, and it's been great. Gives me a break from everything and allows me to pay rent. I'm very grateful for it. But at any moment they could decide I'm "fit for work" again and stop it, or my housemates or landlord discover I drink too much or neglect myself and kick me out, or I might get another mental health crisis and leave myself. It's like a switch in my brain and I just leave the country or something like that, it's happened a couple times before. I'm saving up as much as I can now so when it happens I'll at least have a couple months to survive on until I get back to my normal self. But for now, yeah, I'm very grateful to be able to use it. Thanks for trying to help!
jnm4ug,gbcovds,,Hm.. Why not busking? Learn a bit of guitar, maybe sing too, sometimes it makes more money than just panhandling.
jnm4ug,,gbdu9lk,Hey, thanks for the tip! I've been thinking about that, playing the harmonica maybe, that would be great. Would love to play an instrument even to just pass the time, panhandling would be even better. I've tried guitar before and didn't think it was for me. Wouldn't it take ages to get ok-ish with such an instrument? I used to have a keyboard and still try my hand at pianos at times, but I must've spent months on end learning hours a day and am still nowhere good enough to even try to busk using the instrument. Everyone can hear I'm a total beginner, completely out of rhythm. How long would you say it takes to get at a level good enough to busk? My brain tells me it's no use because of never getting good at the keyboard. It has been a real interest of mine though.
jnm4ug,gbffjy9,,Obviously you have some skills. You have learned a lot just to survive the big challenge with learning a profitable skill is getting a good teacher
jm9fop,gatxopt,,That looks amazing

jm9fop,,gauftbp,I have a gun, an axe, a horse and a dog.  Well, I used to in a previous life. Before there was such a thing as 'homelessness'.
jm9fop,gaua9fq,,Catch and cook? sit back smoke and throw down some ice cold beers?!? yessir tyvm

jm9fop,gaw3fe2,,What a nice invitation!
jm9fop,gaznqqm,,You know, my family (myself, partner, and 3 and 4 year old) have made the best "camping trip" out of our "unexpected departure". We started an Instagram account about bushcrafting, fishing, homesteading, offgriding and what not....most fulfilling thing I think I've done as a parent.  Legitimately proudest moment when my 3 and 4 year old sons make feather sticks, catch a fish on a hook they made and smelled themselves, or when they help process a catch/hunt.  I have never been prouder of all that theyve learned and the peace and quiet is awesome. We actually get time in to teach them.   Cheers man. From our band in the river to yours. It's getting cold here. Stay warm where you're at :)  Epic tales come from overcoming horrible situations and bad timing. Beer and smokes help too lol
jlhq6b,gapd9jv,,If you claim to be suicidal they evaluate you for a realistic and specific plan and the means to carry it out. Going in and saying you feel suicidal generally doesn‚Äôt cut it.
jlhq6b,,gapmw9d,True, but I suggest drinking a pint of Vodka before going in or walking into a police station and tell them you are going to kill yourself. You'll be in a psych ward in no time! Speaking from personal experience.
jlhq6b,,gaq9mtk,I‚Äôm sorry, but where did OP suggest suicide?  EDIT: oh he didn‚Äôt. Some idiot did.
jlhq6b,,gapz2x8,I always tell them that I'm going to jump off a bridge. There are a lot of freeway bridges here so usually it works. One time they did not believe me so I just went to another hospital and did the same thing. I found that if you go in from the start saying I'm suicidal I have xyz plan and keep sticking to that throughout the evaluation, they will hospitalize you.
jlhq6b,gaq1sqo,,Call 211  for information on free dental services. They should be able to point you in the right direction.
jlhq6b,gapgaqb,,Get to new york. there are laws that prevent the city from keeping you outside unfairly. people are getting hotel rooms for free if they are homeless.     127 west 25th street, they'll tell you how to get to the coalition for the homeless.
jlhq6b,gardax7,,You can always commit a crime and go to prison and be housed and fed
jlhq6b,,gatepul,they'll give ya some orajel, pull your tooth right on out, put a cotton ball on it and two ibuprofens. charge your account $10, but you'll get out of the negative after your second week of work.
jlhq6b,gapgyl6,,The toothache...do you know where to find free dental care in your area?
jlhq6b,,gapmxlu,There is no "free dental care" anywhere anymore.
jlhq6b,,gaq004m,Denti-Cal in California is free. You have to qualify but as a homeless person, shouldnt have much trouble. Doesnt cover all the procedures I needed but it did cover some cavity fillings and root canals. Still in the process of getting my wisdom teeth removed but they should cover that too from what my dentist told me.
jlhq6b,,gasji71,You don't know how lucky you are to live in a state not controlled by nut-job, right-wing republicans who don't give a shit about anyone but the fellow rich and huge corporations.
jlhq6b,,gatqstr,Oh man, I feel you though. I probably have no idea just how lucky I was to be born in Cali. I always tell people, I wouldnt be caught dead in any other state. But hey, I do have to say the Democrats have their own problems too. They promote all these good things for us but most of them end up being empty promises or are just straight up deceitful. The government is falling apart and nobody can really escape it at this point unless you find a way to ditch the country.  I want to add, if you can find a way out here such as a Greyhound bus, you should be able to get some work done on your teeth. You do have to wait until the system processes your application but if you work the programs the right way you can get assistance in making your application and receiving the benefits. You dont have to be a resident of California you can just tell the social workers that you live here now and once it's all over you can even move back to your home state if you want. I've met people from San Diego to New York and everywhere in between out here. Once you get the benefits you just choose a dentist from a state certified list of Denti-Cal dentists and you will get the work done free of charge. When I was a homeless minor I couldn't receive the benefits and one of my cavities reached down to the nerve. Most painful fucking day of my life. Wouldn't wish that pain on anybody.
jlhq6b,,gaw3uf3,I am no fan of the Democrats, either, but in a moronic political system where there are only 2 options, you can still be terrible as long as you are not as bad as the other choice. Even before Republicans decided to become a cult and go totally nuts, rejecting facts, logic, reason, science, etc.....their policies were completely immoral and showed a stunning lack of care for anyone less fortunate. You really have to be either insane, uninformed or evil to support them now.
jlhq6b,,gaq0ajo,No offense, but I think I would rather be dead than live in California. Gov. Newsom is trying to set rules on how people should celebrate Thanksgiving?!
jlhq6b,,gaq1r1i,I think with a pandemic that's killing a lot of Americans, I think that's pretty reasonable? Would you seriously rather be dead than not social distance at a yearly event?
jlhq6b,,gaq2bcj,Yes, my freedom overrides your people's safety. I swear every person from California is almost brainwashed by Gov. Newsom. You realize that not every State is like California? The funny part is that the city of Los Angles doesn't give a $hit about the homeless.
jlhq6b,,gaq35j0,Your "us versus them" mentality isn't really conducive to helping end the pandemic.... I can't believe some people would legitimately die instead of wearing a mask or having Thanksgiving outdoors in fair weather.   The governor of any state can't easily solve homelessness when everyone is against even rent control, and make a huge fight when they try to even start parking lots for homeless people living in their cars. By the way, the state wrote a bill to force public institutions like colleges to do just that, and it didn't go through in the end. There is effort being made, but there's a lot of opposition and it doesn't make sense to just blame the governor.
jlhq6b,,gaq5zkp,I think it's time for "grandma" and those at high risk to suck it up and stay home. Why should 85% of the population cater to the 15%? How long do you expect people to wear masks and socially distance? Here in IL, our Gov. ordered all restaurants/bars shut down but no one is listening. The police are not enforcing shit. A Mayor in a Chicago suburb was just on the news and outright said, "we don't find Gov. Prixter's mandates to be legal and won't be following."
jlhq6b,,gaso14c,You are the problem.If your not willing to wear a mask & social distance for the saftey of the public & yourself to help contain the virus then you will most likely end up catching covid spreading it to others or worse,dying from it.Please listen to the health care professionals & the cdc guidelines to keep yourself & others safe.You won't have your "freedoms" if your dead.
jlhq6b,,gathqrn,I don't understand why that person (or anyone) is so against mask-wearing. Homeless people have at-risk populations, too, and wearing masks protects others. And because of lockdowns, cooling centers were closed during summer and homeless people had a harder time finding places to hang out in during the day because restaurants were closed, and even bathrooms were closed. Why can't we be more compassionate for those who are struggling?
jlhq6b,,gatsxvn,Thanksgiving is the last thing on my mind tbh lol. This virus shit does suck though. Some of these days I feel like that mask might as well be superglued on. We are adapting though, in some ways the virus even works in our favor. The big homeless service corporation here is being forced to do away with bunk beds to better enforce "social distancing." We get cubicles now, fuck yeah.
jlhq6b,,gapkrxt,Just like all of the (few) previous times  I have tried to search for, contact, send emails to, ask others, etc...about it - I am getting the runaround or just dead-ends. Seems like unless you are "in their system", then you have to come up with a stack of documents and all sorts of verification. Referrals from people who you need to be referred to, paperwork that you don't have because it doesn't apply to you, etc....it's just a nightmare.
jlhq6b,,gapnpqg,Do you have state issued ID? May I ask where you are located?
jlhq6b,,gapsf2x,Yes. Raleigh.
jlhq6b,,gapt7r0,Do you have Medicaid? If yes, do you have your Medicaid card?   Are you employed? If yes, do you have a paystub?   If no to steady employment, do you have any source of income?
jlhq6b,,gasjoun,North Carolina did not expand Medicaid.
jlhq6b,,gasqs89,I know, but there are other reasons for an adult to have Medicaid in NC. I didn‚Äôt know if you might have already qualified  under those reasons.
jlhq6b,gapz5wy,,What is preventing you from going to Social Services (or calling 211) & letting them know you‚Äôre homeless, & listening to their options? You can get into a shelter, which you‚Äôd have to officially apply for Temporary Assistance. And if you don‚Äôt already have it, you can at the same time apply for Medicaid & SNAP benefits.

jlhq6b,gb1576t,,Just go to the psych ward then rehab then they help you .
jlhq6b,garb7if,,Okay I only have a few minutes to be able to recite this but right now. The first thing is you always need to blend into your surroundings that means people and homes that you go to. Second thing never draw too much attention to yourself because if anyone asks questions and there's not enough of an explanation they will get mad. 3 always have an exit contingency plan never let your stuff out always keep it confined to the area and your stuff that means packs bags whatever always keep your stuff together. Never get too comfortable!!! Now that being said you'll be able to blend in properly as long as you keep yourself well-maintained and don't look like too much of an outsider if you have a job keep on the ideals that you need to be good with your customer base because that is their area that you're going to worry yourself most about if somebody recognizes you from something that somebody posted you have to be able to tell anybody what's going on and have some sort of diversion plan. If need be always have to separate exit plans and a safe meet up place if you are betting with groups. I know there's strength in numbers but sometimes the others in the streets aren't as good as you are I know that for my personal fact
jlhq6b,gapevn6,,Coronavirus has a survival rate of 99.99% for people 19 years old and younger.  The survival rate is 99.95% all the way up to 49 years old.   For older people the survival rate is 95% that's why you hear most of the deaths are from old folks homes.   Don't worry about the virus itself. Worry about the response to it from weak minded people
jlhq6b,,gapfn6k,Most homeless people are especially vulnerable both because of pre-existing conditions and no access to any medical care. I get my information on the virus (and everything else of importance) from reliable news sources and experts who have spent their entire careers working in these fields, not political spin artists or anonymous internet forums. Besides, no matter who are you or what you believe, the virus has been with us for months, so who knows what the long-term consequences will be for people who got infected.
jlhq6b,,gapi1x3,You can tell where this guy gets his info with that "weak minded people" line.
jlhq6b,,gaphz4a,People are ending up with permanent disabilities from it. Also, the more it's spread the faster it can mutate. I'm going to listen to experts, not people who don't know wtf they are talking about.
jlhq6b,,gatg89q,>People are ending up with permanent disabilities from it.  look on the bright side, then you can get ssi+medicaid from copd or whatever and live "poor as fuck", a step better than "homeless as fuck".. :/
jlhq6b,,gati7le,Right, because it doesn't take literally years to get SSI...  You really don't understand disability and homelessness.
jlhq6b,,gatlrce,i got my ssi in 4 months. anyway, "take literally years to get ssi"  does in fact mean that "you can get ssi+medicaid", so what exactly are you thinking i'm not understanding? you seem to agree with me that one can get ssi.  i've spent 9 years, cumulatively, on the street since the age of 16. i've also put in ~3-4 years of volunteer work with homeless services in 5 cities of 3 states. what requirements of homelessness did i fail to meet according to you, the Totally Legitimate Homelessness Adjudicator?
jlhq6b,,gattr8n,There are people like me who have been fighting for years to get SSI. I have been homeless more than ten times over the course of 30 years. I am active with several organizations that address homelessness at the state level. I'm not an expert and neither are you. Stating facts that you aren't familiar with isn't an insult against you. What exactly are you offended by?
jlhq6b,,gatx8i3,>Stating facts that you aren't familiar with  you have to substantiate your "facts". like you claimed that i "don't understand...", i asked for clarification, you responded with "facts" about yourself? did you mean that i don't understand your disability and homelessness specifically? like you agreed that people can get ssi and then said i don't know who you are?  i'm not insulted or offended. i'm confused. i don't understand what point you're trying to make here.

jlhq6b,,gasjans,This was my plan years ago because I knew I would need healthcare, but you are right - unless you are loaded - like have a bank account with $300K or something or have a job that pays tons - you can't move there. Now if I could only find some hot young Canadian girl who has a thing for older homeless Americans .....maybe I could marry her and move there.
jlhq6b,gaq1r6e,,Stop listening to all of the fear mongering on the news and instead pay attention to the daily death count.   Yes we are heading back on an upswing again but the death count is still far lower than what it was back in February and March.   The other big difference is that testing for Covid 19 is significantly higher now and will continue to increase at an exponential rate with stores like CVS and Rite-Aid now offering testing.   Last but not least it should be noted that with a few exceptions our Hospital capacity in the US is more than capable of handling twice as many covid cases right now and we have an abundance of PPE gear, a proven treatment plan and enough ventilators that were now exporting them to other countries.   The reasons given above are why the survival rate per the CDC is now above 99.5% for most age groups.   You still need to take precautions but I wouldn't worry about it and I certainly would not allow the fear of this pandemic to control how I live my life. Just use common sense and wear a mask when in public as a courtesy to others and you'll be fine.
jlhq6b,gaozplh,,If you go to a hospital they will help you tell them you have covid. Boom place to sleep meals, etc

jlw5dw,,gb13vez,Exactly . So fucking dangerous.
jlw5dw,garg9v9,,Lol
jlw5dw,gas6hpn,,If you go into the interior of Mexico at least 50 miles you are actually in Mexico not a border town. Also if you don't act like a touristo (this a almost a cuss word) , but act like a bencinos (a friendly neighbor) you will really open wide your eyes. Find out how to be happy on $ 5 to 10 a day's wage.  Living a lot like your grandfolks did.  The very simple basics of life like your grandfolks, can be very pleasing divested from the rat race of coventness we americans are blessed with.
jkhbwh,gajm6cl,,I know hungry, and it sucks to ask. I have benefitted many times by someone buying me a meal. But I've also learned that sometimes eating what is handed to you or left out for you is not always a good idea. I've also had people get very angry when I turn down food from them. After having piss for lemonade, shit on a sandwich, etc, I would rather have the money to buy what I need to survive.    There is a hate, that burns down inside of you, forever, towards humanity once you become hungry, ignored, casted out, shamed. It is an awful feeling
jkhbwh,,gajmmcx,I'm glad someone out there connected with that description of the hate I saw in his eyes. This reminds me of a quote by Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek: ‚ÄúThe true ethical test is not only the readiness to save the victims, but also - even more, perhaps - the ruthless dedication to annihilating those who made them victims.‚Äù
jkhbwh,,gf4mh28,Yah, past that, I was a bit in awe that you caught any type of look in his eyes. I struggle to meet anyone's gaze, either because they are too busy pretending I'm a planter or a curb or my anger or shame won't allow me to either.
jkhbwh,,gajp8dr,That's just evil to the core. I mean, who gets up in the morning and thinks, hey, I'm going to feed some poor soul a shit sandwich. I seriously hate sharing my air with some people.
jkhbwh,,gajwtzy,I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. I carry protein bars and water bottles in my car for exactly this reason.
jkhbwh,,gf4lo93,No car, and sometimes no way to buy power bars. Car towed for late tags 2 years ago, $2730 to get it out of impound, didn't. Hard to carry backpacks around with food, blankets, clothes, essentials to those jobs.

jkhbwh,gaj3zn8,,Appreciate you buying him food. I once seen a homeless guy shaking (withdrawing) and hiding under a blanket located at a closed down autozone I believe?   Anyways I couldn‚Äôt tell he was shaking or any of that until later but I was in a jimmy johns drive thru with my gf and seen him across the parking lot laying there. I bought an extra sub, chips and coke and brought it over there to him.   He probably was so out of it from what he was going thru he didn‚Äôt even know I was there but I left that food there next to him and I told him that I hope someday he finds peace on this planet and real help.   I think about him every now and then, realistically it could‚Äôve been a woman and I would‚Äôve never known but whoever they are... I hope you find happiness and peace on this planet :(   I say all the time that by the time I die if there is still no help for the homeless or addicted I will truly believe all of this was a waste of a good existence and I‚Äôm 30 so I assume by the time it will still suck... but I pray for different and try to vote accordingly.
jkhbwh,,gaj4f1y,Engels called it "social murder" when the poor are killed off like the homeless are. When conditions are created that make it impossible to survive but the poor are left to die like this

jkhbwh,gajn11e,,You did a good thing, respect : )
jkd85m,gaicidx,,So you got called racist just for saying you were stolen from, even though you didn't accuse anyone? And the shelter not only has video surveillance, they let you, a client, view it?   Sure, buddy.
jkd85m,,gajs3ik,Wanna bet the staff have a very different version of this story? Lol
jkd85m,gaitovj,,I would say sounds good... but... it doesn't. Lemme bust out my BA in PI so I can investigate this case
jkd85m,gaiid2e,,Wow, a double whammy. I'm so sorry, I wish shelters were at least...decent. I hope things turn better for you soon.
jkd85m,gaicusx,,Also, there is no such thing as a BA for private investigation.
jkd85m,,gaiswaf,My diploma from penn foster says otherwise
jkd85m,,gait55g,My degree from penn foster says otherwise.
jkd85m,,gaixhx2,You have a certificate or career diploma, not a BA. And it's from an online college. You know people can look this shit up, right?
jkd85m,,gajs69q,Ironically he didn't expect anyone to investigate.
jkd85m,,gajvmtz,I expect people will look at the classes offered historically as anyone with common sense Would do, and find that the bachelors program for private investigation turned into a certificate program in 2017.  I got my bachelors in 2015. If you can't find it, you aren't looking hard enough.  Edit: misspelled a couple of words.
jkd85m,,gajvysi,Looks like that degree paid off. Lol
jkd85m,gaj0hc3,,I don't think anyone has yet properly apologized to you for what you went through here so allow me. I'm sorry that you had to go through all of that dude. You did not deserve to be stolen from or accused of being racist - adding insult to injury. You were stolen from and did the right thing by reporting it to the mission. They had no right to assault your character like that when you were just reporting the facts. You be sure to stand tall when you stand your ground, you're clearly an intelligent person and ought to be treated as such.
jkd85m,gai6kjp,,And you felt the need to share this story because?
jkd85m,,gaii827,Conversation about life in shelters is a commonly spoken of theme in here. Being falsely accused by shelter staff is something that happens all the time and needs to be point out and brought into the light.   He had his stuff stolen and was insulted too. He deserves a compassionate ear.
jkd85m,,gai6xxz,Because one should never be afraid of shelter staff. Standing your ground as depicted above helps one to remain mentally stable, even when the cards are stacked against oneself.  Use common sense, draw reasonable conclusions, and stick to your guns.  Besides, i see other people venting here, why cant i?
jkd85m,,gai7jc1,Because he not only has been accused of something he is not, he is now been branded. He obviously needed to get it off his chest and is angry and disparaged. Have you ever been accused of something, when You know you were innocent? Doesn‚Äôt feel good.
jkd85m,,gaibtgw,Because he thinks he's the spokesperson for all homeless people and because he loves to talk about himself.
jkd85m,,gait9wc,I aint a spokesperson for jack. But i do like talking about myself.
jkd85m,gai75rn,,It‚Äôs stupid people that accuse someone of racism because they happen to be  white. Idk if your white, but seems like it. Either they‚Äôre racist themselves or thoroughly brainwashed with bleach.
jkd85m,,gai7orr,Well done. Yes i happen to be white. May i ask how you came to that conclusion?
jkd85m,,gaikkgn,Because it‚Äôs become popular to pounce on whites for being racist, whether one is or not, when every race has racists too.
jkd85m,,gaitkip,Seems to me like you have common sense. I fucks with you.
jkd85m,gaj3px5,,Wait why would they call you racist if you didn‚Äôt mention a race? Did they also call you ageist even though you didn‚Äôt mention age? Something doesn‚Äôt make sense lol?
jkd85m,,gajvwy5,The person responsible for resolving this happens to be the same color as the person who stole my items. One can reasonably conclude this is one black man covering fir another.
jkd85m,,gakt6ag,Why would a random black worker cover for a thief that makes your and his life harder just because the thief is black? That makes zero sense and he would not have called you racist for just, ‚Äúsaying someone stole from me.‚Äù But whatever lol
jkd85m,,galic8y,As long as ive been jn the homeless system, i have yet to uncover a different motivation under these circumstances. Some people make a career of homelessness and poverty, a career that often includes theft. The variables are there so the conclusion must be the same. You don't get 6 from 2+2.
jk413d,gahfhev,,What on earth is sheltered homeless, that sounds contradictory. For a whole year???
jk413d,,gaioewd,I was living in a tent/out of my car before social services offered us a motel room for 60% of our cash assistance, we just need to show our case manager we've been looking for income based apartments. Generally, it really can't be beat as we have a roof over our heads, we've made ourselves as at home as we can and moved all of our stuff here, but since income based apartments don't exist in this suburb of Philly we've just been waiting for my ssid.
jjxk6v,galcucm,,1. dumpsters or reduced stuff from the grocery store or Walmart. No full priced canned or packaged item more than $1. 2. Every day. 3. It sucks. 4. Bread or crackers with some sort of cold canned or jarred sauce, chili, beans, etc....and cookies. Once in a while I find a coupon for free stuff - like yesterday I drank a whole quart of heavy whipping cream (64 servings). 5. Once a can or jar is open, all of it must be eaten/drank right then. Bread, cereal, crackers, cookies, etc...on the other hand, I can keep them around for a couple of days unless they get wet. 6. No way to do it. Must consume them entirely immediately. No way to heat, cook, freeze or refrigerate anything. 7. Could write a thick novel on this one, but it has been a disaster. Most of my food every day pre-Covid from hotel breakfast buffets. That 100% is gone now so diet is now infinitely worse and everything is about 400% the cost and I only eat once a day as a result. 8. I can't afford it.
jjxk6v,gdpmpz8,,Hello, did you get other responses? I would love to learn more about your research.
jjmae7,gai89oc,,Born and raised in houma louisiana, currently in demver Colorodo
jjndmf,gadlg4b,,Any experience with free camp grounds? I'm checking some out in the next couple of days. I guess my concern is I need a full camp to not catch shit from cops.  I was sleeping in my car not long ago and got arrested for public intoxication. I was on my psych meds so I'm looking for somewhere safe I won't get messed with.
jjndmf,,gadnyj5,Sorry to hear you had some trouble with the cops.  Free camp grounds can be quite different from each other, so I would suggest you do a fair bit of Googling around and try and check out several.  I've camped at many in the USA (I live in Sweden now), and some were crowded and full of annoying people and also cops/rangers.  Others were really nice and empty, off the beaten path way out in nature.  My advice is to check maps for campsites that are a bit more out in nature.  Also, make sure to be aware of your rights and of the laws in the area you are in.  I know that often cops will not respect your rights, even if you know them and tell them, but do what you can.  Plenty of good Youtube videos out there you can search for on how to deal with cops.  Finally, you can also look into stealth camping.  It's trickier than camping at an established campsite, but it can be a good option.  Just be careful, and remember it's all about picking a good location and, well, being stealthy.  With any campsite, established or stealth, make sure to try your best not to leave a trace.  If for example you stealth camp and mess up the spot with litter and burn in a huge stone fire ring, odds are someone is going to call the cops and/or rangers and report it.  This means not only do you mess things up for yourself, but others.  So be neat, be clean, leave no trace.  Have more than one stealth spot.  Don't overstay your welcome at established campsites.  Hope this helps and good luck.
jjndmf,,gadqm3j,Good insight.  Ive debated stealth but I have intense nightmares meaning I talk and scream in my sleep. I also live in the redneck south. Knowing things wont prevent arrest. Ive tried.  If I get unemployment in the next couple of days In going to scout free camps. Some camping stuff would make life nicer but I have enough to survive.  I need a tent. Last one got destroyed by dogs. A power source and a ton of food would be nice.  Thanks for the thoughts. The cops here ard horrible. I don't want to die. Have had a gun pulled on me. Legally I can't own one which has its good and bad sides.
jjndmf,,gads1bh,I hear you about the cops.  Sometimes there really is nothing you can do.  Try your best and be safe.  There are okay cheap tents you can get, but I highly suggest you pair it with a waterproof tarp, which you can also get for cheap.  You can even score free plastic sheeting from construction sites and such.  Most cheap tents leak or have fabric that is only water resistant and not waterproof.  Let me know if you have any other questions about shelter, or about camp meals for cheap.  I started a whole other thread about cheap and not bad camp meals if you check my post history :)
jjndmf,,gae0ekn,I'm looking at tents again. It just needs to be big enough to lie in. The rest of my stuff will be in my car. Good advice. Thank you.

jinas6,,gab0den,https://harrisburg.craigslist.org/off/d/mechanicsburg-office-spaces-available/7220782274.html  There‚Äôs a bunch on Craigslist. Look under commercial. This one looks great. It‚Äôs more expensive, but it‚Äôs very private and there‚Äôs shared bathrooms and a kitchen!  https://harrisburg.craigslist.org/off/d/harrisburg-beautiful-single-office-for/7209918449.html    To rent an office you will probably need to file a business if you‚Äôre not already an independent contractor for your job. Let me know if you need help doing that. Legal zoom overcharges. You can DM me and I‚Äôll walk you through it for free.
jinas6,,gab0hh8,I don't have a business or a job:/
jinas6,,gabbnm1,Send an inquiry if you want and see if they require a business license they might be fine with you having any remote gig. Do you have a computer or smart phone? Check out a blog called the work at home wife. It‚Äôs all for online side hustles.  GAP is hiring seasonal chat support (entry level!), planted is a start up hiring a lot of remote roles right now, partnerhero is another good source for remote work!  There‚Äôs lots others if you search. I hope that helps ‚ù§Ô∏è
jinas6,ga7o0wu,,Is there anyway to throw up blinds and sleeping bag and blow up mattress down. That would be sweet. But I love the set up and opportunity you got there.

jinas6,,ga7ov0b,Play the long game.  Tape up a calendar tomorrow. Add a couple of "important papers" over the next few days. You really *do* need that 36x48 map, dontcha? And put up about 50 post-its over the next month....  Boom! Privacy!
jinas6,,ga7pcsm,Damn.  You figured that quick. Genius !

jinas6,ga84rab,,I tried to rent out a space like that here in Seattle, but in order to rent one they require a cable or utility bill (they require this to prevent homeless people from renting a room and sleeping in it).  Yes, I'm homeless, but I wanted the room to get work done and attend my classes this quarter.
jinas6,,ga8qt1g,Honestly, why should they give a shit. I k ow people who rented out a business and the guy renting it out put a bed and space heater and fridge in the back office. Oh well. Cuts down on traffic I suppose. Not sure why I'm supposed to give a shit.
jinas6,,ga8x9zp,IBC occupancy classifications Insurance Liability
jinas6,,ga8xeye,Oh. Well damn. I wish for cases like this they could make you sign a waiver and be done with it.
jinas6,,ga9vxwk,Security guards, cops, manager.
jinas6,,gaa7yf1,Yeah, I don't even need it for sleeping. I had a vehicle I could comfortably sleep in, and I'm looking into buying a camper. But even then, they won't rent to you.
jinas6,,gab9fzn,i would pay 20 or 30 bucks for cable for some random person in exchange for them letting me use their address. Then once the cable bill arrived i'd take that and use it to "prove" i wasnt homeless.
jinas6,ga7u0mj,,Some co-working places have showers too.
jinas6,,ga7u3uk,Luckily this one is on the 16th street mall in Denver with a planet fitness across the street!
jinas6,ga7nqmn,,No privacy?
jinas6,,ga7nsp9,Unfortunately not - I think they wanna ensure people aren‚Äôt sleeping in here
jinas6,,ga7z2te,So you aren't allowed to install blinds?
jinas6,ga7qlfo,,Get a some blankets and a air mattress and try to sleep overnight.
jinas6,ga85jud,,That is BRILLIANT!
jinas6,gaa3h00,,I am doing this exact same thing, except I don't have an office.  I have a designated desk with file cabinets.  There are only four an it is very spacious with 24/7 access.  I am basically the only one here because of COVID. I pay $399 per month.  The offices are not much bigger than my space and there is no privacy because you can't put window treatments.  There is a shower here, but I prefer the gym for that. But, there is a kitchen here and I charge up all of my devices and pretty much stay here all day.
jinas6,,gaa415q,I get here about 7am and stay till 10 - go right to my rig and sleep in my sleeping bag‚Äî it‚Äôs like basically a tiny apartment but you sleep in your car for 7 hrs
jinas6,,gaa3xqz,It really is the best kept secret in van life

jinas6,ga9i1vu,,Good for you brother stay strong sir
jinas6,ga9yi69,,This looks super great!
jifcmt,ga64m6s,,It is very broken. Landlords are vampires sucking the life out of the poor.  I'm in a similar situation. Do you have a car?
jifcmt,,ga67rpg,Yes. I'm very lucky to have it. It got broken into and almost all my car-camping stuff (camp stove, solar lamp, big lithium battery, etc.) got stolen, but I could move back into it. That's my backup plan but I'd rather sign a lease.
jifcmt,,ga6e1ct,I would prefer that too but as you seem to know that isn't an option.  Have you called hotels to figure out cost? In my state they can only charge tax for one month. Means month 2+ is cheaper.
jifcmt,,ga6eejq,$160 a night but if you tell them you are a fire evacuee it's $100.
jifcmt,,ga6ust5,Careful if you find a hotel with weekly rates.  I'm in one now until money is saved up and we are paying 1200 a month with a 2k income. Its ridiculously expensive for a place that doesnt even have a kitchen.
jifcmt,,geivj8x,Yeah. Some extended stay places rob you blind :(
jifcmt,,ga6h6jf,Damn. I'm paying $50 a night. I wonder why its so much? The hotel tried to raise my cost due to hurricanes. Told them I would walk with a refund. We never got more than 25% capacity. Asshats.
jifcmt,,ga6hyku,*raise* because of hurricanes?! Not lower because people were fleeing danger?! Absolutely despicable. At least the evacuee prices here are lower than the normal price.
jifcmt,,ga6jbbc,Correct. They tried to profit off a natural disaster. Some of the area that got hit were evacuated but most didnt come to my area. During Katrina refugees flooded our area so these money hungry cunt hairs were getting ready for a massive payday. Covid created a vacuum. They are losing money but won't make up for it with me. They got an absurd amount of reservations and most got cancelled.  Ive been here six months and see the same faces. We have socially distanced outdoor get togethers. We all qualify for tenant rights and discuss how to utilize them. There are families here. Throwing kids into the streets during a pandemic is disgusting. When I pay the employees comment to how I'm the only month to month guest that pays on time. They let people stay, charge a kate fee, because at least they are making money.  The did a mandatory room inspection last week. My area is being devastated by covid but it still forcing openings. The South is retarded. Doing horrible shit with a smile and a stupid accent. Ive been here my entire life and take no pride in that.  Rant/. Tired of stressing every damn day about being on the streets. I need $200. Would have enough supplies to live well out of my car. Have a map with free camping locations. Seems better than the constant worry.
jifcmt,,ga6qu2y,[deleted]
jifcmt,,ga856c5,I second funatical, motels here will rent by the month for business workers like oil field and construction that stay in places for several months. I have thought about it because it includes cable, water and electric
jifcmt,,ga9q34s,It has a bed and privacy. Privacy means not getting roughed up by pigs that have nothing better to do than fuck with people.  I had a psychiatric emergency 8 months ago. Got arrested 5 times. They know my face. I'm hiding.  I have a better idea what to do now. Free camping that looks like camping. Even in free zones if I'm sleeping in my car they will fuck with me. Means I can't take the meds that keep me sane because the trade off is a DUI.
jifcmt,ga6d3wh,,They say that here too but if they NEED tenants, they‚Äôll approve you regardless as long as you can pay your rent. Use your current landlord (roommates) as a reference. Get a personal reference from employer. Spice up your rental application in any way you can. Consider moving somewhere where the cost of living is less, if all else fails, but don‚Äôt completely freak out yet. Our rent to income ratio sucks but we pay our bills & we have had numerous apartments despite feeling it‚Äôs impossible to get approved.
jifcmt,ga697fv,,I cant think of any good advice so I will just send good wishes to you. Here's hoping you find something this week, my friend!
jifcmt,ga6hpvb,,You don't make enough to live alone. Are you also looking into shared spaces with roommates?
jifcmt,,ga6lbp3,Yeah, that's plan A. I'd move into my car before moving in with strangers again though.
jifcmt,ga78swg,,Im having a very similar problem. Me and my bf make like over 2000 a month but its never enough due to the 3x bullshit. We get kicked out on the 31st (5 days) with no where to go
jifcmt,ga73cj4,,See if your state has any rental assistance available due to covid: [nlihc.org](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance)   Or assistance in general: [hud.gov](https://www.hud.gov/topics/rental_assistance)
jifcmt,ga7ghm5,,I‚Äôve been noticing that this is becoming an he norm as well. This or something that says you must have x amount in your bank account.

jifcmt,ga761we,,What about renting a room for the time being? Unless of course you have a family.
jifcmt,ga7thaa,,People can have jobs and have fuck all as rent is too high. You can't do it alone anymore in America. I'm in Dallas. $1500 is the lowest and this is before bills, food, healthcare, etc. Fuck this system.
jifcmt,ga7ukxd,,They're trying to destroy everyones lives right now. I dont know how more apparent it needs to be. Too many true believers in "american democracy" I guess..
jifcmt,ga7uwnl,,I'm assuming you're in the bay area... I know this is a stupid question but have you tried applying to some of the places that ask for 3x the income? I applied for a place and they let me in even without the income requirement (even tho it was listed as a requirement) after I explained that my income is stable and I haven't missed a payment. Some might be more flexible than others even if it's listed. Also, prices are dropping FAST in the bay area. It might be different in a month or two. Sorry if you're not actually in the bay
jifcmt,gacff9f,,When your lease is about to end (14 days) and you're imminently homeless, or if you do end up homeless.  YMMV depending on area but;   The key words to look into and see if you can qualify for are rapid rehousing assistance.   You may also be able to at least get some assistance through a shelter, or homeless service provider in terms of advocacy and  finding a more willing landlord, and working with them to get you approved.  And Rapid rehousing assistance could overcome short term financial barriers while you find a roommate to sustain rent.  Motel route is a trap if you can avoid it. It kind of sucks because if you're not literally seen as a perfect tenant in higher income bracket.  The housing situation landlords  seem to offer these days is their nasty run down motel property they also own which costs an entire paycheck and kind of leaves you stuck.  Also paying for a motel  yourself doesn't count legally count as homeless (even though it is), so it leaves you ineligible for a lot of services.
jifcmt,ga6ivb8,,Last night while we slept, 70,000 children died from starvation.  Homeless people die as well as billionares. Closer to home I had a twin brother who died from cancer. That was 12 years ago, he had just bought a new Mercedes. He died a millionaire. I was always dirt poor and a hobo. Yet I am still alive. Justice is not always in our hands.
jifcmt,,ga6nf9r,I don't care about being poor or rich, I just want to sign a lease.
jifcmt,,ga6w4bf,I agree. Having your own place provides that needed security
jifcmt,ga6azeb,,As I see it, you have been homeless before. You know what to expect, still have a little time to prepare. Prepare for the worse, hope for the best. Because you have a car you have a much better situation than a lot of others. I don't know where you live but $1500 a month for a decent place isn't that high. Where I live, a studio is $1000 a month for the good part of town.  I  live in a bad part of town and sleep with a rifle & with 2 other roomates with  machette & hunting knife. Use your off time to find a camp area like a state park or wildness area.  Craigslist has roommate section and if you are very selective you could try that tempararily.
jifcmt,,ga6brdn,I know I'm much more fortunate than a lot of people on this sub... it's just stupid what we have to resort to to get by. This country treats treat stray dogs better (they get picked up, given free healthcare, housed, fed, and put with families) than humans.
jifcmt,,ga7rkf4,I re read that post and it made me cry. You're so right about the dog thing. Where is our humanity towards each other  ?
jifcmt,ga6zpzt,,Look for place that are not through  a rental agency somone might be more lenient than a rental property
jifcmt,ga7mn2b,,Clarify if it's 3x rent gross or net. Where I live it's gross, so it's before taxes. So even if your take home isn't 3x your gross may be which may qualify you.
jifcmt,ga844ds,,$1500 /month for a room?  #Do you think you are just looking in places beyond your means?  Look at places that do rent for much less! Are you tied to your suburb?
jifcmt,ga8oag4,,Honestly, your best bet may be to get on Craigslist and look at renting a room in a house because people with an empty bedroom to rent are usually pretty motivated to get it rented because they can't cover it on their own.   Also maybe like ok on there for subleases or private non-corporate landlords. They tend to be more flexible on deposit and income requirements.
jifcmt,ga6j772,,Can you rent rooms or shared homes??
jifcmt,ga6lfmn,,Can you rent another room?
jifcmt,ga64w3t,,Looks like it might be time to move. $2200/month shouldn‚Äôt be hard to come by and there are plenty of places with low rent.
jifcmt,,ga654rz,Not trying to be rude, but I think you should re-read their post.  Edit: his to their*
jifcmt,,ga65thi,I did. And what I meant was time to move from that area. No need to be tied to a place with high rent
jifcmt,,ga66hwo,Oh ok, makes sense. I was going to recommend that too. But it may not be the easiest time to find a new job.  OP I'd recommend trying to negotiate working remotely, or being transferred to a remote position asap, after explaining your situation to your boss.
jifcmt,,ga68jmz,Remote work isn't an option. I could quit and move to a cheaper state and look for a new job and a new home, but like you said it's a terrible time to do that.   I'm currently looking at options of finding more roommates or people who will sign the lease on my behalf. I know my options and how to navigate them.  This wasn't really a post meant to be asking for help or advice. I'm just venting at how broken everything is and how unfair and impossible it is for people who don't have family connections to afford a simple and basic life, even when they are good sober people will full time jobs.   I hate that moving out of the state I was born in and away from everyone I know or being homeless are my two options.
jifcmt,,ga68duc,I agree with that 100%
jifcmt,,ga6geej,And then they have no job. How does that make sense? And why do people like you think it's acceptable to have places only wealthy people can afford to live in?
jifcmt,,ga6m9qg,I get what you‚Äôre saying 100% but if they‚Äôre homeless they have a chance of losing there job anyway. So if they moved and got a job somewhere else with a lower cost of living they could be better off then they are now.
jifcmt,,ga6nq9s,I kept a full time job and was a full time student with straight As for two years while living in my car. I'll do it again if I have to.  I see your point about moving somewhere cheaper, but on the one hand if I stay I have a job for sure. If I leave I'm guaranteed to have neither, at least for a while. I'm planning on moving to a cheaper state but I just want to be closer to my family and friends a little bit longer. I'm not doing the greatest mentally or physically and I just couldn't handle a big move like that and starting from scratch again right now.
jifcmt,,ga6p8aq,Places with a lower cost of living usually come with lower wages as well.
jifcmt,ga6cryp,,Nobody says life is easy.  But I bet there are at least a billion people in this world that would love to be in the same boat as you.  If you have $10 in your pocket after bills you are better off than 80% of the world. Closer to home $10 makes you better off than 50 million Americans.
jifcmt,,ga6q0zq,That's a lot of Americans. Maybe we should start speaking out about how fucked the system is and fight for fair housing  and wages then, eh?
jifcmt,,ga6g7va,Wow, so helpful. People die from homelessness every day in this country. Comparing isn't helpful.
jipvis,ga813s3,,The reason the rule.exists is because their are other subs for that like r/assistance. It is simply pointless to duplicate their efforts when the mods have enough to do already.   It isn't mean. It isn't cruel. It is simply not the point of this subreddit.
jipvis,,ga985w1,100% agreed.  They‚Äôve come up with a whole process for vetting people to reduce the risk of getting scammed (for both parties). It doesn‚Äôt always work but it‚Äôs something.  As someone who frequents r/assistance to help, I can only imagine how much time and effort it takes to run that place as smoothly (sometimes) as it does. I can‚Äôt see the mods taking on that extra responsibility as I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre already low on bandwidth.  I‚Äôd definitely try that sub as there are plenty of awesome people on there that have helped others.
jipvis,,gaa1m4n,So we should link to that sub from this one. Like a sticky post or directly in the rules.
jipvis,,gabxc06,The pinned thread from 2 years ago explaining the no begging rule does link to those subs.
jipvis,,gaco2k3,Shit somehow I missed that. I feel silly now. Thanks  Edit: this comment though for sure. https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/994p7j/dont_give_people_money_on_here/e4nluhu?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
jipvis,ga7woxp,,I can answer that from practical experience. Not all, but most that fly signs ( wiil work for food ) be it a real sign or Net note are just plan lying. The money will be used for drugs, booze, or living high on the hog. It's too bad as this ruins it for people really in dire straits that could actually benefit from even a few dollars.
jipvis,,ga83735,>The money will be used for drugs, booze, or living high on the hog.   That's exactly why I drop a brother a fiver. If I'm gonna blow it on booze, who am I to judge him? I don't care what you spend your money on, you do you.
jipvis,ga7vx68,,Pretty sure its a Reddit rule. So, if you like this resource, you have to play by their rules.
jipvis,ga9lhyk,,I hate it but I understand it. The sub would be nothing but begging 24/7 and all other topics, stories, ideas, or questions would get lost or ignored. r/Assistance is worthless for anyone wanting to keep their personal info private.  I made the mistake of simply asking a question over there back when Covid hit the fan in March and was shocked at the mean and unpleasant treatment. I haven't been back there and feel at home on this sub - the best sub on Reddit.
jipvis,gag9qvz,,I wonder how many people who aren't homeless, previously homeless or on the brink of homelessness even bother with this sub?   Anyway I think it would take away from discussions about actual strategy and struggles if all the top post were the most compelling cases to donate.   Having a place for people to vent and share ideas about how to cope sorta separates this place from a lot of feel good bs you find elsewhere.
jhz53z,ga3q876,,As a newly homeless 46 year old, just wonderful.
jhz53z,,ga3sauj,Homelessness sucks balls. I was only homeless for a few months couldn't imagine what it would be like for longer than that. Not only that but it takes ages to recover and I had it a lot better than most. My life wasn't easy before that though.
jhz53z,,ga3zm0t,While I was homeless for 6 months my hair grew slower and cuts and scrapes took alot longer to heal. One of the guys I was homeless with also mentioned that he was having the same problem. Once I moved into a room I could tell my body was using that time to heal. I didn't do any drugs or drink during that time. I can only imagine what people are doing to their bodies when they smoke meth or do heroin
jhz53z,,ga4a84w,All the healing definitely did take substantially longer for me as well. And one very bad problem many homeless suffer from is...(I don't know a proper medical term for it but) foot rot. From having to wear shoes almost constantly, the shoes potentially getting wet, not having clean socks often enough or a shower or toe nail clippers, etcetera. Lots of homeless I knew worried about or suffered from this, myself included. It's especially bad for people with diabetes too. But you get blisters and stuff from walking a lot and its just a bad situation. You don't want to get something infected (which obviously goes for other areas you may not be able to clean enough also).
jhz53z,,ga4bp1o,I've also seen people develop foot problems and foot infections.
jhz53z,,ga4chcb,It's certainly not fun. I used to get blisters a lot. And new socks were a constant need. A diabetic guy I knew (not particularly well) ended up losing toes on both feet because of this. Ouch. It's terrible though. Where I stayed there was a lot of homeless and I learned early on when someone stole my sneakers while I slept that you can't take them off very often or for long sadly.
jhz53z,,ga5s9ep,We always had the rule to take care of your feet and help and remind everyone else to. We had a neighbor in the next tent and his feet smelled like a dead body.
jhz53z,,ga463qm,Yeah I drink and smoke and am trying hard to give up, but with all this Covid19 crap there's not a lot else to do. It's probably going to kill me to be honest.
jhz53z,,ga48afl,Where are you based out of?
jhz53z,,ga48rd3,In what sense?
jhz53z,,ga4fls2,I think they're asking where you live. So they can recommend resources perhaps.
jhz53z,,ga4gpak,I'm ok for now I just need to get rid of the ball and chain.
jhz53z,,ga5s51y,I was a homeless alcoholic for a year and a half and also did whatever heroin I could find. It has wrecked my body. I'm a 39 year old woman but I feel 80. This is shitty. I've been housed for 4 years and am in methadone, I'll probably be a lifer at the clinic but at least it's not dope or 2-4 30 packs every day. I drank 2 and my now ex would drink 2 every day and I have hep c from sharing needles when a random guy showed up outside our tent and yelled "HEY! Y'all wanna shoot some crack?" We were all for it. I did a number on myself especially when we were out in -10¬∞f weather.
jhz53z,,ga5sxlf,Where did you live at the time?
jhz53z,,ga9ecb2,We had a tent in an encampment area at the time. Much like Chris Farley said, we were living in a tent down by the river!
jhz53z,,ga3ybti,I'm 44
jhz53z,ga3q7qk,,Well, I turned 50 today. So maybe I'll die before Midnight?
jhz53z,,ga3ui77,Happy Birthday! Damn I sure hope you don‚Äôt!

jhz53z,,ga4w0ue,I would recommend mushrooms for that ;-)  Fuck making a will and having material shit to leave people Where does our essence go when it leaves the body?
jhz53z,ga39v6d,,Please make sure you take care of yourselves the best you can
jhz53z,,ga4azpd,Well, I AM expecting to die within 24 hours of becoming homeless üòä
jhz53z,ga3tkpk,,I‚Äôm 58, I‚Äôm not homeless now but I have been for several years prior.
jhz53z,ga52c5y,,Oh cool I got 31 years left
jhz53z,ga6xwj2,,Honestly, I would rather die than continue to live this way. I'm severely depressed and my anxiety is through the roof.
jhxs28,ga2w8e7,,We don't need more shelters, we need permanent housing.
jhxs28,ga2xfpa,,There are no questions on your survey that would help you design a shelter. Also, I think you are confusing emergency temporary shelter due to natural disasters and homelessness caused by economics and structural conditions. No city, county, state or country treats those two types of homelessness the same.
jhxs28,ga3tpmt,,They are designing a shelter for a school assignment probably. Not something that will be real life implemented. You can still help whether we need more or not.   Where did the people displaced from the fires run off to if the other shelters are full already? Seems we may still need some if people are out on the streets and they are always full.... üòÇ
jhxs28,ga4y557,,Don't design it like an English poor house from then 1500's. (Most shelters in the US are designed this way)   At a minimum people need some kind of private room, with a door with a lock on it between them and other people, and ideally private bathroom.
jhxs28,ga2w2vp,,Hi,   I have managed long term shelter for individuals experiencing homelessness and I have run temporary emergency shelter for severe weather events and for Covid-19. I can give you some insights into what works long term and what works in temporary shelters. If you are interested go ahead and send a PM and ill send you contact information.
jhbmyf,g9xvplf,,Or find value in yourself , and even if your not realigous and wanna get better, find a city you like and cam get to, mostly every city has a victory outreach women's home, there always free to stay, just do the program and graduate, the pastor's there aren't ways creeps and come from the streets , even if you don't wanna do the Jesus thing, use it as a stepping stone to get of the streets get clean and find a stable job, I've seen many do it.
jhbmyf,g9zrqf9,,Holy shit girl. Gwt yourself away from that creep. I'm actually screaming at my phone. You deserve better and that guy being your pimp. Ummm nope. Move on down the highway. What's he gonna do sue you for back rent ???  Ohhhh this makes so mad. Please find your strength to leave this situation.  Post an update when you can and that guy can F off.
jhbmyf,g9xdsgh,,What you are? Too hard on yourself from the looks of it.  >Said his bills didn't go away either and since I do my extra duties through the motel, he should get a cut.  Not how it works. You tell him you'll simply move to a new hotel and, if you have the courage, boldly tell him to tune you up. Sounds like a bag of shit to me.  Sorry to hear about the rest of the situation.
jhbmyf,,g9xf0hm,fuck...you're right...didn't think of it like that...fuck him....thanks
jhbmyf,g9y2eyh,,Oh my God woman! Don't ever put up with ANY man talking to you like you are a piece of trash! You are worth a million more things than that. Don't let his words kill your self esteem.

jgqhbw,g9sh6rs,,Wow !  I would def find housing and a job and bank the rest. This is the Jumpstart you been waiting for. Don't squander on drugs or booze. I do however love the invite to get burgers !
jgqhbw,,g9v28vp,Op says they have a car... I'd say gym, clothes, job. $3000 seems like a lot but housing will eat it up so quick.
jgqhbw,g9v3hr1,,You can easily pay a security deposit on a shared house room.   Use it to:  1. Get a hair cut.  2. Go to a motel and shower 3. Do laundry.   All in one day.   Then   4. Go on Craigslist and find shared housing the second day. 5. Pay security deposit 6. Get full time housing: CHECK  Then   7. Go to indeed.com.and filled out a SHIT TON of applications.  8. On the next day, call all the places you applied to and tell them you sent in an application and we're wondering when you could schedule an interview.  9. Land a job  Then  10. Enjoy not being homeless anymore.  Possible issues:   1. Not having ID or proper paperwork: you won't need this for craigslist shared house, but you'll probably need it for work. There are organizations for getting homeless people a government ID, I'd recommend looking them up online.  2. If you don't have a phone, get a Tracfone from Walmart.  3. If you have any damaging addictions to substances, I don't have any advice for that.   What NOT to do:  1. Spend money on eating at restaurants.  2. Gamble 3. Buy booze 4. Buy any drugs (housing and job first, weed later) 5. Stay at motels many nights in a row (expensive af) 6. Tell people you just got 3k.   Consider buying:   1. New gear if your current gear is falling to shit. Maybe a travelers backpack, a new 1 person tent, a down sleeping quilt, a good pair of boots, etc 2. Buy one outfit from a thrift store that looks very nice for job interviews. 3. A bicycle?  Ut you could get one of these for free if you know where to look.  4. A hiking stove and propane tank (now you can cook hot meals like spaghetti or pancakes). 5. Macrame string to make jewelry to sell for cash.    I'm beyond happy for your blessing. Use it right, it could totally change your life.
jgqhbw,,g9x5p4k,Thanks so much for all these great ideas! Almost feel this post should be stickied in homeless for everyone who's lost in it.
jgqhbw,g9u2457,,Treasure that Bro
jgqhbw,g9u3enf,,Congrats dude. I hope you the best
jgqhbw,g9ueeec,,Make an investment on gadgets that make your homeless situation less problematic. Like solar powered phone chargers or inflatable beds designed to fit inside your car, first aid kits, quality hygiene supplies, a portable mini air conditioner (not rly important if you usually stay in colder areas like in buildings during the day), etc
jgqhbw,g9ujg26,,I had $5,000 in July and still got denied housing due to my credit score üò≠
jgqhbw,g9s0c9m,,Save save save.
jgqhbw,g9sdh9z,,I'd honestly consider this an emergency fund. Put it somewhere where you won't be tempted to spend it so that when shit inevitably comes up you have some money. Not sure how you're getting income now (if at all) but maybe get some repairs done on the car and just hang on to the rest of it. Don't tap into it unless you absolutely have to. Congratulations on your new life savings! :P
jgqhbw,,g9u79wy,When you‚Äôre homeless, there‚Äôs no such thing as  an ‚Äú emergency fund‚Äù.
jgqhbw,,g9udfb6,Lol yup all your funds are emergency funds.
jgqhbw,,g9ueqv6,My b, it seemed like you were getting some unemployment or something and this wasn‚Äôt the only money coming in. Still a nice ass payday though!
jgqhbw,,g9uf2hx,Your good. Unemployment deposits into a bank of America account which auto transfers to my bank. Well apparently some didn't get auto transfered so I found out I had all this money sitting in it.   I am getting Unemployment right now and waiting for disability or a job. Financially, I can survive the rest of the year no problem.
jgqhbw,,g9uf9be,Good to hear, dude. Stay safe out there!
jgqhbw,g9t4pmm,,I will save it until the hype goes down... Your dopamine can play tricks on you and send you messages: "Buy this!!, "get this", "you need this"... and in the end you end up spending all the cash.    ...   How to avoid this? Save the money in a safe place for a month, at the end of the month you will notice that the hype has gone and you will use that money smartly
jgqhbw,,g9x324w,This is really good advice.
jgqhbw,g9x4n5r,,I would get the gym membership first. Then, get some nice clothes to interview in (target and wal mart). Haircut, shaving products and clip fingernails. Then get job, then housing.  Congrats! I am happy for you.
jgqhbw,,g9xuutm,Thanks for the tips. Good advice. I have an interview at Walmart. All I have is a pair of clean jeans and T-shirt. That should be fine for Walmart right
jgqhbw,,g9y5sks,Sounds good, yes I think that should be fine. Good luck with the interview.
jgqhbw,g9sfdt4,,personally I'd upgrade to a van/camper van. That is assuming getting a flat is not an option.
jgqhbw,g9sm7tn,,Get your car tuned up, Replace tires, and make sure your insurance is paid up. With what's left, put 50% in a six-month CD, 30% into your liquid savings account, 10% into improving your skills, and the final 10% into your phone bill.
jgqhbw,g9spc92,,buy bitcoin, forget about it again.

jgqhbw,g9tiq16,,Libraries are closed no?? Cuz otherwise that‚Äôs where I need to be daily... not looking for coworking spaces. I find one in Sacramento I can work out of for free in exchange for 2 hours of volunteer work per week. But I‚Äôm more free for my base and what city to work in if I can go to any library. üòÇ
jgqhbw,,g9tjoeq,What exactly are you doing? Libraries around me are coming testing sites and you have to reserve your book online and pick it up, no one goes in.  Interested in what you get for those 2 hours of volunteer work. I wouldn't mind doing that.
jgqhbw,g9turmr,, I don't mean this in a rude way at all...but why wouldn't you want to get a place? I know theres many reasons but I'm curious why that wouldn't be top of your list??
jgqhbw,,g9txvwh,Depending on where he lives now, $3000 may not be enough to get into housing.   Keep in mind, you need more than just money to get into housing. You need good credit, references, and a clear rental history plus a job that pays 2.5 times the rent in income.  So $3000 is a decent start, but repairs on a car might be more of a priority right now.
jgqhbw,,g9u0o44,Its enough. I don't know why I don't. I'm autistic with mental issues so I don't really bond with people the way others do. Its hard for me to rent a room with normies and I can't afford my own place. I'm trying to get a job while I wait for a decision from disability to pay me or not.  Got a lot of things on my plate right now and last time I rented a room I had the roommate and neighbors call a 5150 on me. I'd love a room to sleep in but it's not as easy as that.
jgqhbw,,g9wn8dt,Ya I understand 100 percent..I was curious what your reasons are. Wish u luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
jgqhbw,,g9u9u82,This, I found a room for rent in July that would actually take me with just me having unemployment, but turns out this woman has severe legit issues so I'm likely homeless again in a few weeks. I've looked, even month to month rooms for rent want proof of income. It's ridiculous how I actually have a lot of savings right now, but I can't secure housing without an actual job. And I will be living in a paid off car that's in great shape.   In homeless sense I'll be like the top 1% of homelessness.
jgqhbw,,g9udnya,Lol ya same here. Its hard to get a place without proof of income. I almost want to say ill pay you 3 months up front but that doesn't seem like a good idea.
jgqhbw,g9v574i,,Whooo! Hell yeah, get a hotel room and order in a pizza! Congratulations buddy!
jgqhbw,ga3iibk,,Drive food delivery for awhile. Possibly not sure as I‚Äôve never done food delivery. I‚Äôd definitely agree with others and say getting some new clothes, access to a gym and setting up some interviews.  Goodluck.
jgqhbw,g9sa3yf,,I'd say by a van... As much as you can to convert it. r/vandwellers
jgqhbw,,g9udtdd,With $3k? I'd love to find a running van to live in for 3k but I love my volt even more. Van doesn't really solve the no bathroom problem, but it does give privacy to pee in a bottle.

jfyurb,g9opdc7,,Pretty sure a Karen called the cops on me once. In 2015, when I first became homeless, I initially slept in a park. I made sure it was out of the way, specifically to avoid what happened to me; I didn't sleep on a bench or in full view of the public, I slept behind the public toilets, surrounded by bushes. You would have to go out of your way to find me. Woke up one morning to find two cops stood over me, who said someone called them because I was sleeping there, before they told me to move along. Like, ffs, I wasn't hurting anyone, and I always left the park as soon as I woke up, but some Karen was so offended I found somewhere safe and secure (so I thought) to sleep she had to call the cops on me.
jfyurb,,g9ukty9,they need to be hunted down and publicly shamed. you can find out who called the cops on you and sue them!!!!
jfyurb,g9naw0g,,I find the Karen‚Äôs more annoying for involving themselves in other people‚Äôs business, and they‚Äôre probably the reason the cop showed up in the first place. The cop *is* just doing their job, even if they can be massive pricks at times they don‚Äôt need to be.
jfyurb,,g9oxtr0,its not their job to stalk and watch homeless people. if its their job to do that to everyone then they should be doing it to the guy with the 50 dollar take out in the bmw
jfyurb,g9nn585,,I haven't had a big Karen issue yet, honestly I guess I'm really lucky on that. But the police on the other hand, I can't even look at one without getting bad memories or think they're trying to arrest me for no reason:(
jfyurb,g9wol1b,,My mom was a Karen, and she always made sure to start fights and shit with people everytime I was with her, it made me cringe so bad and sometimes even feel sorry for those people she picked a fight with. and sometimes the fights were so heated up that I actually was scared as hell
jfyurb,,g9wrc2v,I actually went back to the same park yesterday. It was even worse. I won't be going back. When I got there the place was empty and I thought I found the most isolated, private, out-of-the-way spot possible. But soon an army of moms driving mini-vans loaded up with screaming kids  - what seemed like a convoy - arrived. And I was surrounded by them. It was the exact opposite of what I wanted. If they had been there first, I would never have gone near them. But they acted like they owned the place and like I was in their private country club even though it is a city park. That was one of the nice things about the total shut-down back in the Spring. I had the whole city to myself.  I hate the lack of privacy and the inability to ever be alone more than anything about about being homeless. I am always lonely, but I am never alone.
jfyurb,ga3slx3,,Taking your photo without permissions is not nice. Yell at them "Do you want an autograph too?"  &#x200B;  if you got a phone, take there picture  t/c
jfyurb,g9ntrdn,,It‚Äôs all based on looks. If you dress nice they won‚Äôt say shit. Polo and some jeans or shorts.. maybe they got that free at the clothes donation places...  showers are free somewhere too right?   Females are perceived a lesser threat for sure. and if kids are there they just take pity. What can you do with kids around anyway? Rob someone in front of them? Put them in harms way if a potential ‚Äúvictim‚Äù wants to fight? Well that‚Äôs why they do Not bother them anyway.
jfyurb,g9ord3a,,>Funny how being a female doing the same thing...doesn't seem to prompt the same sort of reaction.  Well, we males DO commit the majority of crimes, and the vast majority of violent crimes.  It is not an unreasonable bias.  >The guy eating his $50 take-out in the BMW? I guess that is OK.  He's not a better person, nor is he less likely to be a criminal, he's just less likely to commit *violent* crimes.  My neighbor down the street drives a Beemer.  He's in the finance business.   I don't worry about him committing robberies or rapes or burglaries.  But he is the type that would embezzle my 401k.  If I ever heard that he was anywhere near my money, I would change brokerage houses immediately.  There are government agencies - SEC, FBI, IRS, etc - that keep an eye on people like him.  They won't bother you.  Different kind of crimes, different kind of cops.

jfyurb,,g9oj2pe,Explain this one to me please how men benefit
jfyurb,,g9oyumv,because the same ideas that women are weak and men are strong are why stuff like this happens. its also why there are so many more resources for homeless women.
jfyurb,,g9pkmhf,Yes and men are left to carry the weight on there shoulders
jfyurb,,g9q6iau,Feminist ideals would promote ideas that claim men do not need to carry the weight on their shoulders, as you said.   Here's one:  The idea that "men must be strong and protect women" comes from the sexist belief that women are weak, needing protection provided by men. If that belief is taken away, men no longer need to be macho and emotionless, because women would simply take care of themselves. In that feminist world, men could cry and express emotions without fear as being perceived as "weak" "inferior" or "unmanly" *which would lower mens suicide rate* (which is currently very high). It would also take enormous pressure off of men to have high paying, stressful jobs to take care of a nuclear family by themselves.  I could go on, but I want to get back to my book, "Sex At Dawn." But since you asked, this is just one way of many that feminism can be healthy for men. Hope you learned something.
jfyurb,,g9o4olv,Well, it is in its best incarnation of which exactly one in a million subscribe too. But feminists at wolf don't think your way. Nor do most women.
jfyurb,,g9o55xn,And you're totally in a position to speak for most women üòÇüòÇ
jfyurb,,g9ojo8x,Yes I can speak  for myself  and I am a woman and I see how feminism treats men how that movement says all in the name of equality  but I see time and time again  is all about superiority and cherry picking and strawmaning
jfyurb,,g9pxcnu,Agree. And I‚Äôm a female.
jfyurb,,g9o87or,I wasn't speaking for most women, I don't need to as they can speak for themselves.
jfyurb,,g9oa0s8,You literally said in your comment "nor do most women,"
jfyurb,,g9o1ugx,LOL wtf planet do you live on?  Sorry for mansplaining to you  Also it's an earning gap not a wage gap
jfyurb,,g9nikrf,What does feminism have to do with Karens? Genuine question
jfyurb,,g9njeab,I think they may have[feminism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism) confused with  [feminazi](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminazi) People seem to have the two confused quite a bit unfortunatly.
jfyurb,,g9okx2r,Then what the difference  the way I see it it they both have the same name if it has the same name it means the same thing
jfyurb,,g9ol0ub,Did you even open the links are read them
jfyurb,,g9okpgc,Every single Karen I've meet is  a feminism and if not then they use there woman pass to call the cops to use somone else positions of power to ruin a guy's life woman think they can do no wrong
jfyurb,,g9ox0wp,This doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
jfyurb,,g9pl3v3,Woman are valued no matter what  even if they make horrible decisions
jfyurb,,g9ne3cm,Provide something PRODUCTIVE. The idea is homeless men are rabies infested stray dogs.  I think what that speaks to is the deep down darkness most people have. "If I was homeless If rape, steal, and vandalize and become Im a horrible person that odd man must be as well.".
jgf1de,g9q2kem,,If you were wondering whether it was a good idea to be in a homeless shelter this winter the answer is clearly no. At least not if you have any other options.   Take your chances with the cold or with the virus.  Good luck!
jgf1de,,g9qobb7,Or travel to warmer climates and keep your distance from other people. Is that not such a good idea.
jgf1de,,g9r4k22,What if you don‚Äôt have enough frequent flier miles
jgf1de,,g9q9oab,My area has a thermal shelter that is opening soon.  Cramming people together is better than freezing, but I worry about infection there.
jgf1de,g9qnkad,,My very private 8'x14' shed with nearly full amenities, including internet, TV /w Roku, water (soon), HVAC, small frig, and microwave, is where I'll be hiding (free) for the foreseeable future. I'm in good shape in spite of zero income.
jgf1de,,g9qpmq1,How will you be doing that for free? Sounds like you have to pay for internet, electricity and such...
jgf1de,,g9qrimq,It's paid for just not by me. It's all extended from the house of the guy paying for it. He built it for me.
jgf1de,,g9rb4al,Sounds like a great guy
jgf1de,,g9rz7op,Wow that's awesome!!. It's on my xmas wishlist for somebody to build me one. üòÜ
jgf1de,,g9s08ty,I don't know if they are still active but in my state (Ga) there was a "fly under the law" charity that built small shelters for people on property that they didn't necessarily have permission to be on, much less build structures on. Building under a certain size doesn't require a permit here. They generally required that you have been living on the property for an extended period of time, or have permission, so that they had a reasonable basis for assuming they weren't wasting their time, effort, and resources on something that was going to get destroyed in short order. But, at least a couple of years ago, there was a charity here that would do that for you. Though it didn't have the amenities I have.
jg8arv,g9s0vtn,,I see ‚ÄúNow Hiring‚Äù signs everywhere here in Portland Oregon. If you can work you shouldn‚Äôt have to beg for help. Taco Bell across the street needs workers, Burger King is hiring. Just lower your standards and accept a legitimate job offer. I volunteer at homeless shelters here and across the River in Vancouver so I know that nobody here is ever turned away. There is always help available if you‚Äôre interested in working for it. But I‚Äôm talking REALLY interested in working for it.
jg8arv,,g9s6q9d,I found online work that's going to sustain me and my family for the time being and it's not that I don't have an issue with working or any of that I love to work the main issue is just being able to be close by and maintain from my wife who's disabled she was in a merry-go-round accident when she was 14 and her spine is in the shape of a question mark in the right below her neck. So I have no problem doing work it's just the availability of it and yes well I agree there's now hiring signs everywhere at least down here in Louisiana you got 50 people applying for one dang job so it's a numbers game not a determination game when it comes to finding sustainable long-term work now determination is great for short-term day jobs day labor things of that nature which I've been doing. I just got off a job actually right now about to head down to the plasma center make my 50 bucks pay my motel rent for the day get some food and try to relax before I head out this evening to film some more provocative online things that help earn me money. But the greatest news of the day is I have found a long-term stable home that I will be able to get into Halloween day and then I can do whatever program of activity I wish in that son of a gun and make some serious green since I'll finally be able to start saving money back and putting it into investments really thinking about Tesla as a stock option they seem to be on a steady increase with very predictable profit margins and stock increases. And if that cannabis bill passes the house in the Senate come November after the election. I'm really going to start investing in some cannabis stocks as once cannabis is legalized throughout this country it's going to be insane cash crop likes that we haven't seen since cotton.
jg8arv,,g9s8n6o,Great news. Best of luck to ya!
jg8arv,g9pu0rr,,Give him advice then.   - Post on craigslist and see if someone can offer you a tent.   - ask about emergency shelter again. They should be prioritizing families and kids.. your wife and kids may be able to get in a women‚Äôs shelter and you rough it on your own or try a men‚Äôs shelter...   - send the kids to temporary family for however long you need to get on your feet. Check https://safe-families.org/locations/ for your local city. Try as soon as possible.
jg8arv,,g9pxf74,Craigslist is a good idea for a tent didn't think of that.  As for shelters they are still full from hurricanes Laura and delta. Did find a place that's affordable but just got to wait to get my wife's check on the 30th to pay the 500 rent. Landlord is going to work with me on deposit.  As for the kids if we can't find away to keep our room till my wife gets paid. There is no family able to take them. My dad lives 100 miles away and just had major back surgery on the 16th to fuse some disks together, my mother lives closer but she is unable to keep em as she is barely hanging on as it is living in a old rv that's really not safe for young kids.  If I had a car we could just rough it. As is though I'll probably have to loose what I can't carry if we have to camp out for a while.  I'm asking around at a few church's to see if some one could help with rent and get us in there before we have to be on the street.
jg8arv,g9pyvyz,,Well safe families isn‚Äôt about putting them with your family but putting them with a local family in the area. Well to do families who go through a background check and home study. The state is not involved and you can pick them back up whenever. This is a private agreement between you, the agency and the family.   They don‚Äôt need anything but the clothes on their back. The family will feed and buy whatever they need. There is no cost.   Sometimes releasing them for a while is better than them being homeless with you. I used my last money and sent my kid off thousands of miles away to my estranged family so I can rough it out on my own, make some moves and get stable before I retrieve her. But I have also used safe families before when I was in a new city state to get established, start a new job. Etc. I had a child care issue. She got placed with wonderful family who even bought me a used car so I can get to work. Lol. Otherwise was a 1.5 hour bus ride each way. 25-30 minute drive in a car... Personally I don‚Äôt mind distance. Just do what I gotta do. Hahah. No guarantee you will get a car but at least they will be safe. And that‚Äôs a selfless thing to do. Not be attached to them and force them to be homeless with you... it‚Äôs much easier to make moves and get stuff sorted without additional responsibilities.
jg8arv,,g9q08qd,It's a option I'll use if I have to, didn't realize that such a thing was possible.  Thank you very much for the info. If things go real bad before I can get the rent for our new home I know at least the kids will be ok and that's what matters. They are the only reason I have begged so much cuz IV been trying to keep them safe and sheltered. Wife and I can camp, the kids shouldn't have to.
jg8arv,g9r47rc,,Have you looked into options just for your wife and children? There may be more resources available for women and children.  Have you looked at all options locally to make sure you‚Äôre getting the cheapest accommodation you can? AirBnB? Again, look at whether you can get anything for just wife & children or if you each take a child somewhere.  It may not be an option as you say your wife is disabled but are there any extra hours or side hustles she can do?  Anything you can sell?
jg8arv,,g9rbi0o,Nah sold everything I have worth of value back in August and yeah there's very little options as to what we can do in this small City but I talked to my grandmother last night and we're going to work something out where we can still have access to home needs like bathrooms and a kitchen but keep social distancing from her and just kind of camp out in her yard for a few days so we can keep our stuff in her storage shed
jfh5gd,g9kl5cx,,How do those Aussie bars taste?
jfh5gd,,g9lr0su,Aussie bars are amazing
jfh5gd,,g9kn7sm,absolutely delicious!
jfh5gd,g9koocl,,If you can get mail Millennium energy bars are rad. Only had one and it wasn't the greatest but 400cal, vitamins and all that, and doesn't create thirst. You feel full enough.  I bought a decent amount getting ready For car living/riots and martial law. Nutritional powder is good too.  I'm packing on weight so I have some to lose. Also eating hot meals. I rarely do regardless of living situation but it feels good.
jfh5gd,,g9l6g76,For martial law? Lol
jfh5gd,,g9n4lgz,One can dream...
jfh5gd,g9ktthc,,Those Aussie Bites keep forever!
jfh5gd,,g9ku07y,oh yeah months
jfh5gd,g9l3gsf,,I really need to find a filling and healthy snack that I like, I eat a lot of crap foods:(
jfh5gd,,g9lkjs6,Same, almost a month homeless now. Besides a few healthy snacks, mostly just live off fast food app deals. Today i got a loco taco and chicken wrap at Taco bell for $1.03, a whopper at BK since they are $1 on Wednesday. Its easy but can not be healthy.
jfh5gd,,g9mq28k,Yeah I eat a lot of fast food as well because the the price. Once a month or so I go to Walmart and get some fruit and dry stuff.  Its not that bad tbh but I wish I could be eating healthier:(
jfh5gd,g9lo47o,,Nice
jfh5gd,g9vrccc,,Great that you got food
je1q1g,g9brbh7,,Wow !   What great news. New chapter, new places, new people, new adventures and new life. Congrats and enjoy it all.
je1q1g,g9bu646,,Enjoy boot. Glad youre making progress.
je1q1g,g9c0tpv,,Good luck mate. Keep us posted on your adventures!
je1q1g,g9cqfyl,,If you get stationed at Fort Eustis, let me know. It's close to my house (5 minute drive) if you are wanting to get out of the barracks. I'm in the Navy, but if you have any questions let me know and I'll try to help.
je1q1g,,g9dhst1,That's very thoughtful. Idk where I'll go, but after bct I think I'll be at fort benning for ranger training. I went in for sf despite a high asvab score. He told me I could still have a different mos and go to sf
je1q1g,,g9dq3en,My LPO (basically a supervisor) had a friend who was in the army for 23 years before retiring. The advice he gave my LPO was to buy a property near the base you get stationed at. Rent it out to others in your division,  and make sure the rent they are paying completely covers your mortgage.  Then you also make the full mortgage payment, but contact the lender directly and make sure what you pay goes to principle. If you do this, you can have a 30 year loan paid off in about 5 years. If the property is next to a military base, even if stationed elsewhere, you can rent it out strictly to military.  The benefit of doing so is if they break things or refuse to pay, you can contact their chain of command and their command will make them pay and you don't have to worry about it. My LPO didn't tell me that until after I had been in for 8.5 years, so I just bought my house 2 years ago. Hopefully this helps you out. Make a plan and stick to it. If you make enough at a lower rank that you have enough money to do that, when you make rank and get an increase in pay, put the money you get from your pay increase into savings. Another thing would be to set it up automatically for 10% of your check to go towards savings, and keep it for emergency use in the event you decide to only serve 1 contract. Make a plan and stick to it, and you won't have any issues. Feel free to message me at any time if you have any other questions.  I hope this helps.
je1q1g,,g9dw7p0,Holy shit super life pro tip that's avery good idea I'm going to look into this more. Tha ks dude I'm gonna add you on here if that's cool
je1q1g,,g9dz395,Of course, that's  perfectly fine. I'm not that great at using Reddit, but I'll try and add you. Getting a VA loan is nice because it doesn't require a 20% down payment like other loans do.
je1q1g,,g9diegj,They try to fill empty positions so will tel you that what you want isn't available or you should do a different job and switch. If you want a specific job then you can have them wait until it's available. If you already signed it, then their isn't much else you can do about it. When you finish bootcamp and your school(s), you will be sent to a location where you will stay for the rest of the contract. I'm Navy and don't know the terminology the Army uses, so I apologize for that.
je1q1g,,g9di1ae,Did you already sign all the papers?
je1q1g,g9btk8j,,Good for you! That recruiter must've really wanted to help you. Don't forget to send them a Christmas card to say thank you!
je1q1g,,g9dhl57,I made a high asvab score and he gets commission, he definitely didn't do it out of the good of his heart lol
je1q1g,,g9d3n1y,Recruiter gets commission.
je1q1g,,g9d42gj,So they both got something they wanted. He got to finally join, the other gets a bonus. Win win
je1q1g,,g9dblb6,Yes
je1q1g,g9c7tf9,,That is awesome news!  Congratulations and good luck with your next chapter.
je1q1g,g9ck0et,,Congratulations! You have a lot to be proud of in making it this far. You also survived tattoo removal---that shit is painful!! I hope this is the start of many new beginnings for you.
je1q1g,,g9dhntw,Thank you, I wish the same for everyone here. I honestly feel some kind of guilt making this post. I want everyone to be ok
je1q1g,,g9dwqir,I think your feelings are normal, and it's likely going to be an emotional roller coaster ahead as you adapt to so many things. The important thing is to acknowledge the feelings and let those bad feelings pass through you. Focus on what is feeling better, even good--there will be more to come.
je1q1g,,g9dxts8,You're right. Yes ma'am will do. Thank you
je1q1g,g9d4asr,,make sure you choose a good mos with civilian skills when you get out like plumbing or air traffic control so you can make the big bucks if you decide to get out.
je1q1g,g9cqll6,,The recruiter paid?  Like out of their own pocket?  How much did that cost?
je1q1g,g9cizio,,I'm really happy for you! This is good news.
je1q1g,,g9dhvuv,Thank you, I wish we were all ok, I feel bad making this post because I want us all to be ok
je1q1g,,g9dzuhd,There‚Äôs this thing called survivor guilt... it‚Äôs okay to feel compassion for your fellow sufferers and still have  joy that you are not among them. It‚Äôs happened to me and I found it helpful to ‚Äúoffer up‚Äù other suffering for it. It sounds weird, but it worked for me.   When some drill sergeant rousts you out of bed at 0200 to run your twenty - offer it up, run your best run yet...  Anyway, I‚Äôm glad you posted. People need to see change to believe it.
je1q1g,,g9e248a,You guys and gals continue to say correct and amazing things. I will do that, thank you for the advice
je1q1g,,g9fj2pv,Just think if you stay in the Army for 20 yrs you can retire young with pension and full benefits
je1q1g,g9cjqyt,,that is so awesome! don't be a knuckle head and stay the course! GL
je1q1g,g9cph15,,Vet here, good luck!
je1q1g,g9e1uoc,,For the love of God don't buy a car as soon as you get stationed at your unit. Avoid people who wanna be your best friend as soon as you arrive too.  I only did 7 years before I was med boarded for PTSD. But joined as an older guy and saw a lot of bullshit.  Shoot me a message if you have questions.
je1q1g,g9cslz3,,I‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôve found your way to changes that work for you. Good luck to you. I wish you the very best.
je1q1g,g9cxay8,,Congrats on your succes story man!  You're lucky you found such an awesome recruiter.  Good luck on your journey. When you get deployed, please be nice to the civvies from other countries, they're just victims of the long war.
je1q1g,g9czqs5,,Very lovely advice, my friend. Good luck, be safe and enjoy the adventure! <3
je1q1g,g9f2b2e,,Congrats my dude. I ship out Monday so I won't be homeless either!!
je1q1g,g9d7gui,,Use it to your advantage. All the best.
je1q1g,g9dluqn,,Congrats bud! That was my ticket out of the gutter and it did well by me. Good luck!
je1q1g,g9e0rmq,,I'm happy for you. I acquired a shotgun today
je1q1g,g9e4bmw,,Omg, that's really great. All the best , keep working hard. All the best.
je1q1g,g9f8tjw,,Joining the army is no joke. Shit is going to get real, very fast.  But you have something going for you now and that‚Äôs awesome. There is a future now. Let me tell you, if you can make a career out of the army and retire from it, you‚Äôre set.  I‚Äôve got several retired military buddies who are sitting pretty.
je1q1g,g9ckh8l,,Stay in for the full 20 years for retirement benefits
jebduk,g9gkjkh,,My biggest issue is trying to be grateful I have life at all. I hate being alive if this is the way I have to live. Sorry but that's how I feel.
jebduk,g9dekbj,,Every day. I‚Äôve gotten as used to it as one can get, which isn‚Äôt fully possible I think...
jebduk,g9eapee,,humiliation takes place even at a shelters. It's not easy.
jebduk,g9gpjr6,,I really think you guys are heroic.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll last 24 hours out there.
jebduk,g9hxr9m,,I do feel worthy. I always have the Buddha's assistance wherever I go, and I go to the library often to learn and continue my studies and expand my mind. The key is to be friendly to all, and to avoid shady people. If an officer stops you, simply say you don't have a name so you don't get stuck under trespassing.  People around this world are depressed, from all walks of life. A strong spiritual practice will keep you from being suicidal, even if ultimately you find it all pointless out here.  I haven't been humiliated yet, but I have a good past backing me up (volunteering, etc), so I'm not too upset, as I can always rely on my good deeds and my generous and jolly nature. I wonder how long I can endure it, but perhaps something will turn up. Honestly, I'm not too upset at the prospect of jail at the moment, as it's been raining and perhaps a jail bed is better than a steel bench and wet clothes?  Simply teaches me more gratefulness. When I received the bag with 12 pop open cans of soup, I was in heaven with something as simple as chili and beans. Keep yourself simple, but keep your mind sharp. Have goodwill for those who look down on you; they are teaching you patience as they take the guise of an enemy. Respect every gift given to you. And treasure advice like this.
jebduk,ga4503b,,Makes me feel like the world is against me, tbh. But I keep pushing against the grain and hoping that I can work it out eventually.
jdbgy5,g97xu33,,>It is always interesting to listen to people‚Äôs unfiltered/vile thoughts about other human beings, while the speaker thinks they are speaking to someone not belonging to that group.  Oh yes it is. The quieter you are the more you hear and the more you find out what people really think and feel underneath their social persona.
jdbgy5,g97x9m4,,My one friend and x wife know.  My x because after long enough I will go crazy and need my kids kept from me.  My friend because its a joke for him. Owns 30+ rental properties. Only thing Ive ever asked for is work. He's offered help a couple of times. When I take him up on it he renigs. I love that man but watching him give people who are wholly dependent on their parents at 40, and I live in my car is frustrating.  Oh well. Two more weeks at the hotel. At least it will be cold sleeping in my car. I can handle that. Also just got a solar charger so won't have to run my engine as much.
jdbgy5,,g985yz0,Smart,solar charger was 1 of my best buys
jdbgy5,,g98cj46,I got mine on Prime day. Debated one of the huge ones but decided portability was important in case my car breaks down or I get arrested for being intoxicated (on psych meds) sleeping in my car again.  What a shit life.
jdbgy5,,g986ztj,What do you mean by he gives to people?
jdbgy5,,g98ae4n,Endless free rent.
jdbgy5,,g98d38w,Why does he give out free rent?
jdbgy5,,g98fvjt,Usually stupidity.
jdbgy5,,g98j74z,Always stupidity.  I wanna say I'm his only equal and therefore cant take from him. I think its more he enjoys my suffering.  Hes my only friend. We talk a couple times a month. See each other 2-3 times a year.  My x wife saw what was going on. She warned me. I didn't see it. I see it now but aside from not talking cant really do anything.
jdbgy5,,g98o0tz,He doesn‚Äôt sound like a very good friend, TBH.
jdbgy5,,g98ornn,Hes not.   That said, does ability mean required? I guess I'm jealous in that he helps others while he watches me fall apart but does that mean anything?  I don't know what his thoughts are. I don't even ask. Has never done any good anyways.
jdbgy5,,g98p322,Maybe you should focus your energy on people who will try to bring you up, rather than those who enjoy looking down on you. You deserve quality people in your life
jdbgy5,,g98qy2h,Im happy not having friends. He and my x are grandfathered in. After my last episode I decided no more friends/witnesses.  All the work I put in to lead a normal life is lost. Again. Because thats how ot works.
jdbgy5,,g98i6ly,Their poor decisions. One spent their savings on a rotting yacht. Other because they quit their jobs because they "couldn't take it anymore" despite having kids.   The common denominator is they are his wife's friends.  I cant figure it out oast that. I do think he likes the thought of my suffering.
jdbgy5,g98dcfp,,Yes, I've lost a lot of friends because of this.   Also, if you do happen to have a job, do what you can to make sure your coworkers never find out you are homeless. They will try to get you fired.  One major reason there is so much discrimination towards the homeless is that people are afraid it can happen to them, and you are a reminder of that. So they won't want you around.
jdbgy5,g992r7s,,How sad that this is true!!   I'm pretty open about my last homeless experiences, and even then, even when I'm not homeless anymore, people act WEIRD afterwards. As if im somehow sick or bad. It's so discouraging, especially when all these people believe they are "good people." Like maaann get out of here with your stupid self-righteous bullshit. You can't be a "good person" and think that homelessness is a sign of some evil or wicked behavior.
jdbgy5,g997ckd,,Once upon a time a young bird refused to fly south. His mother and siblings all told him winter was coming but he couldnt be bothered, and soon afterwards the north wind began to blow. Determined not to yield to this thing called winter, the little bird went out in search of a warm place. After walking across a snow covered field the bird encountered a cow, and in a stroke of blind luck the cow dropped a large load of shit on the bird.  The shit was warm, and the little bird felt his blood warming up and after a few minutes he began to sing. It seemed everything would be okay, he was warm and getting warmer and the little bird couldnt help but sing a happy tune. A cat from a nearby farmhouse heard the bird and promptly made his way to the field and ate the bird.  The moral of this story is this... Those who shit on you may still be your friend. Those who dig you out of shit may still be your enemy. And if you are up to your neck in shit and you are happy to be there keep your damn mouth shut about it.  Homelessness makes enemies look friendly and vice versa. Dont be fooled and keep your mouth closed unless absolutely necessary. Giving strangers on the street (or even friends who know you) an earful about your lot in life rarely ever ends well.    Minding ones own business is a virtue.
jdbgy5,g98i5ep,,I find when you‚Äôre struggling with housing a few people may really want to help but also have the idea they know what‚Äôs best and that all their unhelpful advice is a sign you‚Äôre just too picky or lazy to solve your problems. Good thing some people who are paid to be helpful actually understand and don‚Äôt think getting a job is the ultimate solution despite high rent costs. People who haven‚Äôt lived your life will never understand and people who have that basic need met are coming from a place of privileged ignorance.
jdbgy5,g991eg4,,I have thick skin, so this is nothing to worry about.
jdbgy5,,g9dt2p1,I'm the same way, if 'friends' turn out to be hateful about something important to my life then they can GTFO, I don't care. Coworkers were a different story because people WILL try to get you fired, but just friends? Judgmental? They were gone so fast because I ditched them if they even hinted at anything like even pity. Life is too short for me to keep people like that around, even when things got tough.
jdbgy5,g98fsh6,,My mother knows. My ex husband aka best friend knows. My brother from another mother knows.  Not sure about anyone else. And honestly i don't really care. I have more important things to focus on right now than listening to idle shit gossipy bullshit from people who have no real world experience.  OP, if I were you, listening to that toxic shit is going to do nothing but depress you and make you feel like a failure. Find yourself some people that will be happy for you even with small things... Like finding a warm place to sleep or a halfway decent item of clothing.  Don't surround yourself with nasty people.
jdbgy5,g9b8ua1,,My friend laughed at me.....
jdbgy5,g976p33,,Your friends are just shitty or you were bumming about
jdbgy5,g976n1t,,Thats just probably who your friends are. My friend started to look down on me. Its because he saw me smoking weed more than working and that I ate a lot of his snacks. That and some other shit but that is unrelated to my homelessness. The friend who I am staying with now? Nah man he dont look down on me, although to be fair he's been there himself. I mean there's a 1000 reasons you should have a house, but its just easy to forget you only need one to not be housed. You were unlucky enough to be in your situstion. Maybe its more your fault than not, but all that means is you were unlucky enough at sometime in your past when you learned whatever it was the enabled you to make thise decisions. But most of my friends are just supportive. No one wants to see yoh like that, so they gave their own reason as to how you will get out and how long it will take
jdbgy5,g9hzpt9,,Most people are fools and do not wish to understand the sufferings of others, being half blind and deaf themselves. Many people, being inferior spiritually and mentally, decide to look down on others to gain a sense of value from life, not realizing that they are really looking down on themselves ultimately. This situation can happen to anyone, thus I've always had compassion for people in this situation.  That said, turn to something good and true. For me, it is the Dharma and the Five Precepts, which keep me off drugs and with a clear mind while I'm out here. Check into them.  Don't let people look down on you. Have a spiritual sort of pride to you. You're homeless, sure, but aren't you also a king that sleeps under the stars and moon and beautiful clouds? Shift your perspective and you shift the tables.
jds2tj,g9ahq5x,,The variability is so extensive that asking specific questions like this is almost like asking what kinds of jobs do humans do. The majority of homeless people are invisible that do a lot couch surfing. Most of these actually have a job but simply do not make enough money to maintain a home. This was exacerbated greatly when companies started limiting hours to 20 hours a week to avoid having to offer health insurance. Yet the scheduled hours are so inconsistent that working a second job without schedules clashing is effectively impossible. Especially when even a full 40 hours often wouldn't make rent. These are the homeless people that keep it secret, and are the ones most people deal with in some capacity everyday without realizing it. There's also a high number of homeless people attending college. Officially about 18% of people attending two-year colleges and 14% of those attending four-year colleges are homeless at some point during their studies. Some people attending high school are also homeless.  The most visible homeless people tend to be the most visible for a reason. Because their issues extend well beyond just being homeless. So in spite of them being a minority they tend to be the subset of homeless people that the statistics to ostensibly define the issues of the homeless are drawn from.   For these reasons I, or anybody else for that matter, can't answer questions 1 and 2 at all. Those questions are simply too general. Like asking which hair style homeless people prefer. It simply makes no sense in the context of the entire homeless population, or even a majority.  **Question 3:**   I've seen homeless people attend college. I've seen homeless women sleep in ditches by night and wait tables by day. I've seen homeless people on bicycles pulling trailers that migrated north to south with the seasons, constant on the move from state to state. I've seen homeless people that would squat abandoned houses. I've seen homeless people, both male and female, become prostitutes. Join gangs. Marry. And everything thing else you can think of. I personally made the majority of my money collecting cans, and purchased a moped since it was cheep and didn't require a license where I'm at.  **Question 4:**   Define "stand on your own feet?" I always stood on my own feet. More so when homeless than any other time. But probably the single biggest challenge is the fact that if you are homeless any and everything you acquire will periodically get gone if it's not strapped to your back, and sometimes even then. There is simply no place, however small, that you have control or autonomy over. Like what anybody with a home has. Much less trash pickup service or the ability to call any authority to deal with someone encroaching on your personal space. Your space is not even your property to control.   **Question 5:**   Anything people are willing to give is fine. I don't fly kites or begs at all. I'll even avoid paying to much attention to people because it puts them on the spot and tends to make them uncomfortable. If they want to offer something they can come to me, and some do. I'm not going to judge you either way. I well understand that most people simply have no foundation for understanding the issues. Like after hurricane Katrina a family that just lost the home and everything in it was camping in a field. When they called a FEMA hotline from a payphone they were told to wait on a callback. And when they tried to explain that wasn't possible they were accused of having an attitude and should do what they were told if they wanted any help.   Largely the demands put on homeless people to receive help actually makes their situation worse. How can someone continue attending college if they are required to abide by a curfew at a shelter miles away, and they don't even have the transportation to get there? How do you maintain or extend a support network, that helps you eat, provides an occasional couch to sleep on, provides occasional transportation like the guy at an apartment complex I scavenged the dumpsters for cans from that would periodically haul my cans to the scrap yard for me, etc. etc., if a shelter imposes a curfew on me and micromanages my free hours in order to "help" me?   So if there's anything I'm going to judge people for it's not going to be for the ill conceived offering of help. I'll thank you the same for a completely useless donation as I would a handful of cash. But once you make demands or put conditions on your help you can take your help elsewhere and forget I ever existed. Essentially universally the people that are the most insistent on "helping" you will decide that you then "owe" them anything you have of value that they want. Including that $15 dollars you hobbled around on a bad leg digging through dumpsters for all week for. Shelters are often not any better, and in some ways worse. They just getting their benefits primarily from other sources. But their micromanaging of your choices is worse. Institutionalization of people is not "helping." It simply makes you personally the property of someone else.
jds2tj,g9dgf2w,,Homeless is different for different people in different places, but this is my experience.   \1. Is homelessness just a phase or does it become a lifestyle?  I take some issue with the wording of the question to be honest. It sounds almost as if you think that people choose to become homeless... Let me make this clear. The vast majority of the homeless do not choose to become homeless, they are forced to become homeless, often with physical threats of violence. But regarding the answer, for the majority of those that are homeless, they see it as a phase that they are moving through.  \2. What leads to one becoming homeless?  Eviction usually. What causes evictions? A lack of affordable housing, a lack of decent paying jobs, racial discrimination, mental health issues, a lot of things. Mostly boils down to landlords and greed.  \3. What have you done (or seen others do) to get out of the situation?  I got lucky and found a program that would take me in and house me for a while. Just about everyone is trying to get out of the situation that they are in. ALMOST NOBODY CHOOSES TO BE HOMELESS. People are constantly looking for work or, if they have managed to save up enough money, which is surprisingly hard to do, they will be looking for a place.  \4. What are some challenges you (or others) come across when trying to stand on your own feet?  When I was homeless I was almost constantly standing on my own feet in a very literal sense. But I doubt that is what you mean. It is hard to find a job without an address or a shower. It is hard to find a place without a job. Its hard to find a place to not freeze to death when it is cold, and it is hard to find a place to not overheat when it is hot. People are constantly treating you like you are the scum of the earth. People are constantly assuming that you choose to be homeless. The cops never leave you alone.  It is made very clear to homeless people that they are not wanted or welcome everywhere you go. It's hard to do much of anything under these circumstances beyond survival. And it is all very tiring.  \5. What is your philosophy for when it comes to accepting/asking for free stuff?  I didn't really ask for stuff unless I needed it. And even then, people would give you shit and tell you to "Go get a fucking job you lazy bum", as if I wasn't trying. I'd happily take whatever people had to offer though. Sometimes even if I didn't need it, just because I knew another homeless person that did.  You take whatever help you can get from folks. You swollow your pride and just do it, because otherwise you die.
jds2tj,,g9dwwuo,Thank you for clarifying a lot of the misconceptions. I was in some small seminar where the speaker brought up the topic very briefly, regarding the rise of homelessness in California as if it's the best state to become homeless due to the year-round comfortable climate and to escape the steep rents, in addition to the mental illness or drug addiction that leads an unstable life. And it made me realize that society does think that way, but I didn't like his tone/perception, so I wanted to hear from the other side of the coin.
jds2tj,,g9dxv31,No problem. I can't imagine a ton of homeless folks moving to California for the weather. Lol.   There is a program, at least where I lived at the time, where they would get you a one-way train, plane, or bus ticket to anywhere in the US if you could prove you had housing waiting there. That was kind of cool.  Drug addiction and mental health are not the most common cause of people becoming homeless, but they tend to keep people homeless once they are. Both are things that make it hard to find a job and a place. And they can lead to a negative feedback loop. I mean life sucks, so drugs help you with the pain. And being homeless is not really great for any mental health problem.  I appreciate you reaching out to this sub to get the other side of this. As I said in my earlier post, most people treat the homeless pretty bad, so I do appreciate you listening.
jds2tj,g9a6zd2,,Its a chronic issue. Homeless once often means homeless again. Van dwellers, vagabond, etc can be a choice.  For me mental illness. I build a life, go psychotic, lose everything.  Never seen someone get out. Not fully. I did for a decade. See comment about mental illness.  Its not an "on your own feet" thing. You have extreme privelage. You may not see it but you dont know what it's like to be on your own two feet. I have no safety net. When I fail nothing catches me. Most Americans are one flat tire from homeless.  What am I asking for? I need medicine. Food. Theres no shame in asking for help. Again, my privelage isnt as great. Being a nearly 40 white male used to help. Cops pull guns more now. That advantage is gone.  Feel free to ask for specifics. Most of us are ill. Like everyone we made poor choices, or had no choices, but that lack of a net comes into play.  Edit: reads kind of angry. Not intentional. Most people don't see what they have till its gone. After every episode I had less and less. The idea of getting on our feet is pointing blame when really homelessness is a social issue that affects an individual. Know a cheap place to stay? No? There isn't one. Look at all the laws against us then tell me of all the opportunities we are missing.
jds2tj,g9a66nk,,2. You lose your income.  You get evicted / foreclosed.
jds2tj,g9e6egz,,What I dont understand is even though a person makes mistakes. The justice system and society in the US in general is set up to where you cant make a better life. Most repeat offenders go back to the same lifestyle because there are no other options. Take me for example.  I've been homeless for three years. I played my dues I'm sober and will continue to stay that way (that is my intention anyway) but yet I cant find gainful employment. Sure I can get a job at a fast food restaurant that pays minimum wage.  But oh you say there are lots of single mothers working at fastfood restaurants living on there own. Yes there are. But they arent convicted  felons.  They live in subsidized apartments,draw child support, families first, snap benefits and etc. These are things a convicted felon isnt eligible for.  So we are released to the world to gender for ourselves. So after all else fails. We eventually revert to doing the same crap we've always done.
jds2tj,g9e8w90,,Mine is so rare I doubt it would help. Plus if your trying to learn how not to be homeless it most likely won't apply to you.  But don't ever think things are so good that you can't ever become homeless. You might have a plan. You might have family that you could go to. But even with this it's super rare that anyone outside the 1% could ever lose everything and become homeless. It doesn't have to be your fault. Anyone can become homeless in an instant.   Look at covid. I'll guarantee many people who thought they were immune to homelessness are now homeless because of it. Or the effects of it.
jds2tj,g9aduz1,,https://www.google.com/search?q=what+causes+homelessness&oq=what+causes+hom&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.5963j0j7&client=ms-android-sprint-us-revc&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8  You already seem to have some opinion that homelessness is a choice. It is very rarely a thing experienced voluntarily.
jds2tj,g9i04sy,,Question 1 and 2 are completely variable on the individual in question. I can say from first hand experience though, that the typical scapegoat of addiction and mental illness is not actually as big of a factor in homelessness as the media likes to blow it up to be. I'm not saying there are no homeless people out there who are are homeless because of those factors, just that it's less common than you would imagine. Now addiction and mental illness are extremely common in the homeless population but often that is the result of being homeless or of other factors that led to the homelessness such as trauma or family estrangement. The reason I originally became homeless myself was because of childhood trauma, uninvolved parents, and a broken foster system, but my struggle to escape homelessness became exacerbated by the mental illness I developed as a result of all of that. So TLDR the reasons behind homelessness are a lot more complicated than you would think.   3..  I've done some crazy shit to try and get out of my situation and I've seen other people do some crazy shit too. Some people get married, or have kids and try collecting the welfare, some people sell drugs, get involved in prostitution. On the flip side I've also tried getting a job, going to shelters, and I knew people who did the same, but it rarely pans out, at least that's been my experience both in my own case as well as those I have known.   4..  Systematic disadvantages + social stigma. Definitely the largest barrier to becoming self sufficient. Employers don't want to hire homeless people. Landlords don't want to rent to us. There are many other smaller factors in this like illiteracy, substance abuse and mental illness, physical disabilities, and just general lack of a support system. But the systematic aspect is by far the biggest barrier.  5.. Be safe. Basically. Be cautious when accepting assistance, food, money, favors, anything really. Rich people will try to lure in homeless people to take advantage of them, for things like sex or labor. Other homeless people will help you only so you can become indebted to them or so that they can steal what little you have or sexually assault you once your gaurd is down. In regards to asking for things I try to only use that as a last resort since bumming is typically frowned upon even by the homeless population themselves.
jds2tj,g9jo9ix,,I would disagree with your claim that ‚Äúno one in society seems to care about the homeless.‚Äù  There are countless organizations and people who care and want to help.   Sometimes the people trying to help ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù don‚Äôt listen to the people in need.   Kudos to you for educating yourself and wanting to help. I think a lot of people tend to think of homelessness as an intractable problem, but there are solutions that work.
jds2tj,gaaoto9,,There can be many reasons why someone becomes homeless. Choice is rather rare but one reason. Those that absolutely hate being homeless usually find a way out. Even going to jail for a roof over your head. However after a year of homelessness, many just settle into the daily routine. Often BUT NOT ALWAYS using drug and/or booze to cope.
jds2tj,g9a5d57,,I'd like to know as well
jcyojs,g94arv7,,Right now, hating a particular type of work is not an option. If you need money to survive, then any legal job that pays, should. Choice is a luxury. When you luxury of choice, then you can choose your employment.
jcyojs,,g94p4gg,r/choosingbeggers
jcyojs,,g94bl9i,I just have trouble understanding how people can tolerate jobs that pay so little yet demand so much, and then demand even more just for the slightest chance at better wages. I worked my ass off at my best job, and was told I wasn‚Äôt working hard enough. I was later fired when they learned I was homeless.
jcyojs,,g94eixo,Because in order to survive, we need to work. Everything has a cost. You want to buy gas, you want a phone, a T-shirt.   The best promotion- is self promotion. In another words, you work at a job, look for a better job and then leave. You don‚Äôt stick around to be abused or fired, because they feel they own you. You don‚Äôt wait around to see when they will value you as a wonderful employee. Many employers take advantage of their employees.
jcyojs,,g94f8pl,But if I juggle 3 part time jobs, all of them draining me physically, mentally, and emotionally, operating on 2-6 hours of sleep, will I ever be able to find work I enjoy? I‚Äôll only have time for work, no time to look for better work, no time to improve my programming skills, only labor. And in the modern age, the concept of existing just to exist, constantly working, sounds outdated and bad.
jcyojs,,g94gx81,Sometimes, yes, juggling multiple jobs. It depends on the individuals circumstances and wants. It‚Äôs what you‚Äôre willing to give up and how much of it, in return for something else.  If you don‚Äôt want a typical job, then you do something with entrepreneurship, but you still have sustain yourself with some income until then.   You actually believe people nowadays work harder than pre-Industrial. Those people worked before the crack of dawn and only stopped when there was no natural light with maybe Resting on Sunday only. They had very, very little for the amount of hard work they put in. That was hard work.
jcyojs,,g94h1dc,So basically, I‚Äôm just lazy?
jcyojs,,g94hbkp,I‚Äôm not saying that. What I‚Äôm saying is- you get, what you put in. If your satisfied with your current state, then that‚Äôs all it matters.
jcyojs,,g94hmbs,Idk if that‚Äôs true. I put in all I had in my Walmart job, and got told I wasn‚Äôt working hard enough. When I am working a traditional job, I am always underperforming, regardless of effort. What I put in only benefits those already more fortunate than I. And I‚Äôm always just stuck in the gutter.
jcyojs,,g94iijt,I agree with you. Many employers don‚Äôt appreciate their employees, but you have to find a way to show yourself in a different light.  A lot of times it‚Äôs just perception. Other people are better showing themselves in better light, doesn‚Äôt mean they work harder. All I‚Äôm saying is work, until you can transition into better job or be self-employed
jcyojs,,g94neay,That's actually not true about how people lived in the past.
jcyojs,,g94czib,What bills do you have to pay since you are homeless? I am assuming you don't have rent?
jcyojs,,g94d4dx,Phone, insurance, gym membership, and a citation for swerving on the road at night.
jcyojs,,g94z8mv,Employers shouldn't be able to fire you for being homeless. You may be able to file a lawsuit.
jcyojs,,g9apzb2,Pretty sure that‚Äôs illegal. If that‚Äôs seriously the case you should consult a lawyer
jcyojs,,g9bmtzm,With what money? Anyway, it‚Äôs not like I can prove it.
jcyojs,,g9bxguv,Maybe you can find someone who will rent out their RV for a while, if u have a car maybe you can do Postmates or door dash to make money on the side and still have time for your project
jcyojs,,g9bxnef,Suing people isn‚Äôt my passion. There are other things I‚Äôll spend the money on way sooner than trying and failing to sue.
jcyojs,,g9ccmlx,I made that suggestion just as a money making opportunity, I absolutely understand not taking a legal route but just so you know there are lawyers that only have you pay if you win the case. What you do is up to you I only want you to know what possibilities are out there. Always do what is best for you! That‚Äôs all that matters :)
jcyojs,,g9ccrdd,I also just might need to work at that precise location again, and don‚Äôt want them to hate my guts.
jcyojs,g94yev7,,What skills do you have? Just by being a game dev - I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôll have a lot if you list them down on some paper.  Possibly consider becoming self-employed by doing commission work for emerging online businesses. Ex: copywriting, creating landing pages, ads,etc.  The idea is to provide some service/value to one of these businesses, it is a hot market imo. If you become good, you can get on a contract to get paid repeatedly + get recommendations.   You can look into pivoting to IT/app dev temporarily also. Your main thing should be to get your head above water and increase income. Start a side business online, if the jobs you‚Äôre qualified for won‚Äôt cut it long term  Edit: there are also benefits to owning your own business(tax deductions=more money in your accounts). All of the info you need to get ahead is online, please research as much as you can. Hope this helps üëçüèæ

jck7pu,g944l91,,Good point about donated clothes not being washed. I'm guessing it may depend on each state or public health department to oversee donation businesses and set standards for reselling items, so maybe that's where to find out if stores sell dirty stuff. I get that you can't "prove" clothes are washed so it could be BS even if they say clothes are washed, but I know the thrift stores in my area that clean items before putting them on the floor make sure customers know that's their policy.
jck7pu,g984zws,,Join a Monastery or a Commune... is that different...?

jbslec,g9ek91m,,hello,  don't sneak in.    alot of times people try to sneak in using an old expired card or they borrow someone else's card.  there's no name or picture on the card so like anyone can use your card.  some gyms will give you maybe a free or cheap 7 day trial.  alot of gyms used to give out free trial memberships.  don't ever tell them, you're homeless.  if you do, they will not give you a membership at all.  they are gyms that give out memberships for as low as $20 per month.  if you have a checking account, they will take a check for the first month and they will take it out of your account for every month after that.    i had a membership with 1 gym.  they had like a hundred locations.  i paid for like 2 months and i kept using it for a year.  they sent me a bill later on for what i owed but i got to use the place for a year.    these name brand gyms aren't really the type that you can sneak in.  sometimes you might be able to get into a gym at a college or a university without anyone giving you any trouble.    if you can get an id from a college or a university, you should be able to use it's gym.
jbslec,g8x7ope,,Walk in like you own the place, but have no interest in speaking to your employees or 'the public'.
jbslec,g8y4z3v,,Depends on the gym and how "on their shit" they are. See, now with the covid restrictions all the gyms in my area been closed so when they open, I feel like they'll probably be all neurotic. Probably taking people's temperature at the door, maybe taking names for contact tracing..who knows? Again, depends on the level of crazy and enforcement. Pre-covid days I knew some gyms I could get away with it and some I couldn't. Some I just walked right in (looking at my phone, busy and like I belonged with no worries), some I walked in straight for the locker room and even threw up a friendly little wave if the desk people glanced in my direction acting like I knew them or was a regular or something. And some (best case scenario) I walked in and wouldn't even see anybody really watching or paying attention and just slipped right in unnoticed. I don't know if you have a vehicle, but I'd say just try it. I mean go for it. Worst that can happen is they stop you and turn you away. In which case I'd just drive to the next closest one and try there. The first time you do this it might be a little iffy or you might have to test the waters at multiple spots. But it's like anything else, soon you'll figure it out and be doing it regularly like it's nothing. I figured out which were my two favorite easy ones and used to go there periodically. Mix it up you know? I'd hit there and sometimes the truck stops. The truck stop ones cost money but they also have laundry facilities there too (all for the on the road long haul guys) and it's usually pretty cheap...so I know being broke is tough but if you can muster up $12 bucks (what I paid for a shower and laundry on the rare occasions they made me pay) it might be worth it to be clean and have clean fresh clothes. And sometimes you can meet a cool attendant who will just unlock it for you and look the other way (if they don't have a manager around). Never hurts to ask ya know? There are some kind people out there where if you explain your situation and reach out (and that you're not asking for money, just to shower and be clean....people are sometimes sympathetic to that as it's such a fundamental need). I wish you the best of luck.üôÇ
jbslec,g8yjsgj,,All of these won't work because they will always make you scan a key card even inside.  Go late at night, lookout for people in rv's or trucks/cars that look like they live in it.

Say hello be nice but don't over talk that's suspicious.
jbslec,g8xeocj,,when you walk in like you own the place carry a hampster cage. If anyone does try to stop you let them know you are actually part of the extermination team to exterminate the roach problem. And when they ask whats up witht he cage explain that hampsters are the new thing for getting rid of roaches because they just eat them. they are trained to seek out the roaches and dispatch them and return to the cage when they are all gone or when they get full.

j9vj14,g8oq0la,,>I've monitored this subreddit for a few years  Great. Just what the homeless need, more monitoring. /s
j9c5c2,g8jdyq1,,Where are you? Near a Catholic Charities by chance? Lots of help there (at least where I am, in Minneapolis/St. Paul). They have a shelter that can lead to housing for single adults. No need to fit the criteria of domestic abuse.
j9c5c2,,g8k1l5o,Yeah the catholic church near me has a huge campus but posted no trespassing signs everywhere and has zero homeless help and will call the cops on us. But tbh all churches are like that where I'm at. Church is a business in TN honestly.
j9c5c2,,g8k2o3k,Catholic Charities is not a church, but an organization specifically to help the homeless. The one near me has an emergency shelter, meals, medical care, mental health treatment, dental, access to computers, clean needles and long-term housing. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs even MORE services that I don‚Äôt know about. Churches aren‚Äôt always helpful to the homeless, although I feel they should be.
j9c5c2,,g8k35hz,I'll have to look that up. And yeah Jesus is gonna have some questions for some pastors and church administrators for sure.
j9c5c2,,g8jlsqu,No not much help at all.
j9c5c2,g8iu7t5,,I am so sorry. Our world is fucked to an extreme level. You deserve a safe and warm home regardless of your mental condition or whether you have a job. DM me if you want to talk.
j9c5c2,,g8ivygp,Thanks. Feels nice knowing at least one person gives a shit
j9c5c2,g8jc96e,,I don't know why some communities can't pick a space and put old cars in it and let each homeless person have that one car to live in. Then the community services can try to help those they can. It's a quick solution. I don't know why I've never seen it. Tons and tons of old cars.
j9c5c2,,g8jfjb1,They wouldn't even have to do that, there are enough bank owned foreclosures to just give everyone a house who needs one.   A. It would actually be cheaper for taxpayers to lighten the burden of the most vulnerable this way than to treat the symptoms and fallout of homelessness.  B. This could be accomplished with foreclosures currently held by banks that received bailout money during the credit-default-swap fiasco.  The homeless serve a function. We operate as an unspoken threat, the final punishment for legal non-compliance. We are the stick to the Kardashian carrot. Without us people would start demanding an end to their obvious oppression, but so long as the threat of something worse looms people will clutch their monkey wrenches and the system operates smoothly.
j9c5c2,,g8k1tp1,You fucking genius lol. That's all we are a reminder that if you don't play the game perfectly and do your 40 hours with no mistakes we will make you suffer.
j9c5c2,,g8k3qw1,For almost fifteen years it was my life's mission to abuse that illusion. I've spent years, counting up the number of seconds at least two full years in a stranger's direct line of sight, frolicking gaily as an obviously homeless person, sleeping on sidewalks, fucking in bushes, day drinking, all with the biggest shit eating grin I could muster, even as my teeth fell out.  I would hold on to that mission like a stuffed animal, standing for hours and hours on the side of a highway as countless cars passed. All the while trying to look intrepid and beatific and hopeful, and above all, happy. I wanted to be a proof of concept for freedom, a beacon out, a signpost for those grappling with turning their backs on late stage capitalism and joining us in the ruins.   I retired a couple years ago. Eventually my joi-de-vive attracted a hot-wife with secret leninist leanings. She's more neuro-typical and is able to compartmentalize her contempt for our crushing oppression enough to work a legitimate job. She's a front line grocer making 18/hr, so now I'm a video game addict/house husband/haute chef/epic-level masseur/shut-in.
j9c5c2,,g8k4wky,You should make a video game lol
j9c5c2,,g8kcbkm,as a straight dude, i think i love you.
j9c5c2,,g8lsh4x,Same, I'm too mentally ill to work and can't pull it off. I could do college, but not a nine to five. Thankfully, I have very kind parents who let me stay here, and I was good looking (this helps if you don't have a job), so I always had girlfriends that didn't care if I lived at home. I'm 41 and date a 29 year old chemist. I'm luckier than most. I have a brother who will take me into his basement when they pass. I just cannot work, sorry, society. No SSI just food and shelter from family.
j9c5c2,,g8mmwa2,It isn't your mentality that's ill, it's the society your mind-brain is trapped in. It's a reasonable response to an unreasonable situation. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  The *only* people who manage in this kind of exploitative econocentric society, where the laborers don't ever benefit from increases in productivity, are people who can compartmentalize away the cognitive dissonance and pray that they're destined for something better. üî•üá±üá∑üî•  Well, and the sociopaths who find it easy to do the exploiting and work their way quickly into middle management. They're usually the ones decrying the failures of the poor and looking suggestively at everyone's bootstraps. Of course what they're really eyeing are those delicious looking boots, because there is nothing a Walmart proselytizer loves more than licking boots.... some people need to be told what to do, and that they are doing it right. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
j9c5c2,,g8molyo,It's impossible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps in some situations. Many have abuse problems, mental illness, etc. I'm lucky to be from a supportive family that always took me in, but imagine trying to navigate this shit as an 18 year old foster kid straight out of the system? The only person I know who can't work and is semi-making it gets SSDI: almost impossible to get and only $1200 a month. He's able to rent cheap places, have a computer and a car. If you can't make it in the low wage, inhumane 9-5 world, you are fucked. Many are not lucky enough to have a support network to fall back on.
j9c5c2,,g8jh45d,Banks are never going to let people just stay in empty houses while they're on the market for the same reason grocery stores won't give away food that isn't selling. Some communities would rather lock up a house than even rent it because there are people who, even in a rental space, will tear up the walls looking for copper pipe.  In between those people and those who use drugs that represent a sizable chunk of the homeless, opening all vacant homes to the homeless has serious problems.
j9c5c2,,g8jjsg5,A. Grocery stores in some Dutch countries legally mandate their grocery stores to give away spoilage.  B. Vacant hoses get their copper stolen far more often than rented units, I've known people who got a great rental price on their house because someone couldn't rent it and they didn't want it vacant before they could make improvements. It's the reason for most owner-carries.  C. What problems?  D. Again, those banks owe the American people trillions of dollars, it doesn't have be their choice. We can force them to pay back those loans with currently frozen equity.   What about insulation in the cars? Have you ever slept in a car? It leads directly to back and joint pain. It's every bit as humiliating as sleeping in a tent on the sidewalk, or a field. At least in a tent you have space to stretch out and for a mattress and blankets.   I've lived in a car for months. It's fucking awful. I've lived in a tent for over a decade, it was pretty alright.   You know, if we're pointing out obvious problems (which I totally wasn't doing, btw, was not telling you that you were wrong) there are the obvious and serious problems with using garbage to house homeless people.
j9c5c2,,g8k2n3t,Yea but old cars that dont run could be gutted and beds put in. But it wouldn't work for the same reason shelters don't their are evil and selfish people. The bank idea would be what the American people deserve though. Property as a business and a credit score being tanked by medical debt because I cant afford a deductible why tf would I pay a premium I also cant afford because rent is 60 percent of my income is why ive worked for 10 years and I'm 28 but still can't own a home.
j9c5c2,,g8kh2lx,But there are also, in my opinion, way more compassionate people than the evil and selfish ones. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair of you to relegate several billion people you don‚Äôt know, and absolutely will likely *never* get to know, to an asshole status.  Furthermore, you‚Äôre only 28. Do you grasp how many 50, 60, 70, 80, etc year olds have been working 4, 5, 6, 7 decades more than you and still have haven‚Äôt heard the ability to buy a home? Or how many people in So many places are forced to love of off half a dozen dollars a day *if that*? Or how many folks in India have to live off pagpag because they literally can not afford to buy food that hasn‚Äôt been collected from trash?  I don‚Äôt know you, and I‚Äôm not judging you...but I‚Äôm trying to show you that compassion is key. I sure as shit don‚Äôt have a trust fund or some kind of buried treasure, but I make do with what I do have, and most people are trying to do the same just to survive day by day.  The world doesn‚Äôt owe you a house just because you survived to 28.  You gotta work with what you have. Ya know, the same way all the rest of us several billions of people are trying to do.
j9c5c2,,g8jk0ov,The idea of offering cars was not a solution so much as something that could EASILY be done as a first step.

j9c5c2,,g8k0yer,That's great but I've seen in the dumpster diving forums that huge amounts of food goes in dumpsters. And the food distribution is often through food banks, which are often run by a church group, which can be a bit of a trip.
j9c5c2,,g8kx322,Fair enough. I too have seen a lot of dumpster diving for food. Do you know of more dumpster diving communities than r/dumpsterdiving and the trash tossers discord server?
j9c5c2,,g8kz43y,Try Freecycle. https://www.freecycle.org/
j9c5c2,,g8k1y85,Yo Wal-Mart gives all food not sold to homeless shelters lol
j9c5c2,,g8kbc17,it is my understanding the bailout money you are referring to is actually a loan and the companies have paid it back with interest to the government. The similar bailout that's been given to the airlines currently is also a loan that they will have to pay back.
j9c5c2,,g8kf2os,Okay.   That is actually super complicated.   I understand a little about the original CDS quagmire, but TARP is an entirely different far more complicated solution to an already complicated problem.   I did not realize.   I didn't even know that I didn't know.   Thank you for helping me find my ignorance. Damn.   Three more minutes in the TARP wikipedia page would have made my eyes bleed.
j9c5c2,,g8kbk8o,Also, the foreclosures you are referring to are the debts that the loanee took out with the mortgage company. So to give away the house would be to eat the loss in the remaining balance for that loan. Mind you, the money they loan out is the money from their customers bank accounts. The money that is deposited into their bank is redistributed as a loan to other assets.
j9c5c2,,g8kfmjb,Seriously tho, we could be moving people into arrested developments and stagnate condo projects, the government could step in and buy the failing properties and give them over to municipalities to manage. Dallas bought the famous Decker Hotel when it went bankrupt, turned it into a jail. The same could be done for affordable housing.   OP deserves a house that they aren't afraid of losing. That they don't have to navigate byzantine bureaucracies to qualify for, where they aren't discriminated against because of lifestyle or disabilities or even for past mistakes.   We all do.   Profit is for luxury not basic necessities.
j9c5c2,,g8l2ada,I'm not an expert on this either. The government did build public housing in the 1930s, they were the Projects. I don't have an exact reason, but If I had to extrapolate a reason, they stopped maintaining physical properties because of the large overhead and like most public projects, it was given over to private bodies. Now that program has transformed into Section 8 housing program, where the government subsidizes people's rents. Since the government gave up those public properties, I doubt they would go back into the business of owning housing again because of the headache that is associated with it.

j9c5c2,g8kzhgu,,Head on down to Monessen PA. 48% of the town is abandoned, but theres plenty of houses that one could claim and just live in if they chose to.   It's also a college town, so always dorm parties, cheap delivery food, 24hr gas stations, and a drive through beer store, and liquor store on either end of town.   I lived up there in college for 3 years paying 495 for half a house at my first place, a small 1 bedroom apartment with a full basement, half finished, half was a workshop/laundry room. My 2nd place I was sharing a 6 bedroom 4 story Victorian with my ex and a friend, and with utilities we were only paying 250 a month each, since the landlord was the then mayor, and she didnt like overcharging students like the school does(500+ a month for 1 room).  If you enroll in the school, Pell grants and FAFSA will cover most of the courses, plus a dorm room for at least a few semesters, which is what a lot of people I know did, just to get a foot into the housing and make friends there. A few squatted in empty dorm rooms with their girlfriends, or boyfriends for months, and as long as you're not causing a problem, no one should rat on you.  The school also had 24/7 access via key fobs for almost all of its buildings, but the main one has a kitchen and wifi.   Theres also a monthly food drive, and if you work it for 8hrs, 2 days a month, you'll basically get to pick out about 800 bucks or more worth of free groceries from their donation piles. Anything they cant put into every single box goes to the workers, and theres a LOT. When I worked there, we had 8 deep freezers of just meats, and 2 walk ins for more meats and breads.  Between me and my ex, we would bring home around 1500 a month in food each, and were always being told to take more, and give it to our friends. Had I not drove a small ass car, I would have. Wed give whatever we couldn't fit in our pantry and fridge to who ever came first, and wed have a bbq or taco Tuesdays every week, along with always having birthday cakes and cookies/pastries on hand for whoever's birthday it was that month. All free, for 16 hrs of labor loading boxes into cars.    Sorry for this long ass post, I'm a stoner insomniac who goes on rants, but hope some of this helps someone in some way.

j8qp45,,g8ejdde,Same I don't understand this feeling tbh
j8qp45,,g8l99h2,I think we are social creatures and some people miss it subconsciously more than others  Me, growing up in a pretty cold and violent household, actually liked to eat on my own and be in peace  That‚Äôs probably why I lean towards meditation and solitude and the life of a Christian/Buddhist monk appeals to me greatly. Simple and blameless living without hurting others
j8qp45,,g8lal2m,Yeah I feel that, although I think you need to understand that Christianity is actually a very social religion. It's based on missionary work, that's what Christianity is at its core. I also don't think Christianity to be a good religion in general. Sure it could make some people get on the right track but at the expense of hypocrisy and extreme narrow mindedness. They don't really accept other people that aren't Christian well. Where a Buddhist is literally the complete opposite of a christian.   The reason I bring this up is because Christianity in my family is a huge reason why we've never gotten along. I don't have to explain how asinine christianity is, they show how asinine they are pretty blatantly. Christianity hurts people a lot in my experience..  Be a Buddhist not a christian. Or even better taoist

Anyways, fast forward a couple years and now I'm with my partner and don't do alot alone but I do miss it. I think it takes a certain kind of person to do things alone.
j8qp45,g8ecgdj,,I always eat alone unless I'm with someone. Too many people have misconstrued my actions. Kinda wording that weird I guess. A "hi" for example. Especially on a hot day.

j8lbgd,g8c8fep,,This would be illegal in my area.  Texas is horrible. Even Austin.
j8lbgd,,g8cec49,Huh, yah. How many cities have made it illegal to feed the homeless? I remember whole Crises around feeding the poor in parks with soup and sandwiches.  People were arrested.
j8lbgd,,g8d513a,It happens here. To do it you need a permit.  The organizer won't pick up which makes it harder for the next person to get a permit.
j8lbgd,,g8d7ojr,They don't issue those permits though.  The logic goes like this. As soon as you make refuge or aid for homeless a thing, word spreads and that activity draws more needy people to that place, the park whatever. They set up 'camp' and congregate around the next scheduled 'feeding'.  Then the city council looks out their window and or starts receiving complaints about *"all the damn homeless in THEIR park"*.  "It used to be such a nice place , I walked my dog and let my children play and now all this 'riff riaf' is coming round."    "Can't you *do* sometheennng??"  In my experience it was better for me to just disappear off the beaten path as much as possible and see to my own needs. Out of sight , out of mind.  Screw all the normies that look down their noses at poor people,
j8lbgd,,g8hi17l,I avoid other people like the plague.  My father is one of the people you outlined. When he runs his mouth I ask why he doesn't want ME to have food, safety, and healthcare. I'm mentally ill so he makes an exception for me.  Most of the homeless are. He won't hear it though.  I live in a liberal mecca. Those morons think they have it figured out which is just as, if not worse than, the entitled conservative view of things. Discussing it with people is impossible. Evidently I didn't try hard enough.   Everything is shit and I hope it all implodes under the pressure of their self righteousness.
j8lbgd,,g8hjhd7,Their self righteousness and greed hidden behind the tarnished cloak of false piety.  The wider problem too with how they view and treat, not just family, but the whole world.  You described my Dad too. He used to bar me from home except holidays, had to keep up appearances. One time he left me at the end of a dirt road with my backpack , then drove home to sleep like a baby in his four bedroom home.  He always justified this kind of behavior with religion. 'The Bible Says', give them over to the devil, translated in his mind, if they don't go to church then its okay to abandon them.
j8lbgd,,g8hnzc1,Sounds familiar although my father wont go with "Jesus will it.". He is convinced of his superiority to all. Narcissism at best. Megalomaniacal at worst.  Trying to explain to a generation that prospered off their parents but think they did it themselves is impossible. I was close with my grandparents. They watched in horror at the generation they spawned. Like all they thought they were doing right.  Stay vigilant. We have an edge in that we know how to survive. I cant think of any other benefit we have.
j8lbgd,,g8i56lv,Oh yah, my nfamily only hides behind religion facade, they really think they are superior too, just use it as an excuse.  Do what I say or god will punish you. They also get out of helping others, they just 'pray for them' without actually helping. Dump it in gods lap, right? Blame others for not doing 'gods will'. Narcs and religion are a perfect match made in hell.  Each generation to come will be smarter, more aware of manipulation than the last, thank goodness. More power to them.
j8lbgd,,g8lemnk,My kids are being raised without religion. Not atheist per say, just an emphasis on morality and community. Prayer doesn't make sense to them. It amuses me their reaction.   My x's parents where super upset by this despite being fake xtians. My father respected what I was doing. I think, in part, his reaction was due to the fact that religion didnt fix his evil. It was just a cover. My x's family see it as a last ditch effort to get into heaven. Its weird. The only time her family goes into prayer is when her father is having chest pains. "I'm dying!!! Help me Jebus! I don't want to die!!!". Even my youngest sees the hypocrisy in their pleas.
j8lbgd,,g8lk7la,Your kids are aware, not fooled by religious dogma. Good for them.   Churchianity has little to do with actual Spirituality. Like you said many use it for cover. Narcs excel at this, having many facades of hobbyist, busy body pursuits that keep up appearances of normalcy. Its only when you are on the inside you begin to see thru their false piety or cloak of respectability.  Your doinga great job raising your children. More power to you. :)

j8edyi,,g8d82xq,And he gains another couple millions every single day. But he's working so so hard for it and he does so much and he's such a good guy and a hero and and and yadda yadda... I can't hear it anymore. Nobody should have that much money. Nobody deserves that much. Never!
j8edyi,,g8hporb,No one NEEDS more than $10 million. If you have that, you and your family are set in perpetuity. Warning a lousy 5% on such a fortune is an income of half a million dollars a year.  Anything beyond that is used for just one thing; power. Power in the form of manipulating public opinion, political influence, rent seeking, bribery and threats.  Amazon and Jeff Beelzebub is the poster child for what's wrong BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY TAXES. They don't contribute to the country; they're systematically parasitising America. They're the same as Wal-Mart in this regard.
j8edyi,,g8hq7ba,Precisely. Politicians will probably never do anything about it, even though it's taxes that pay for their salary. We're on our own. 230 years ago they had some good ideas of how to deal with rich folks that don't pay their fair share. Even though they later overstated the case a little...

j7z0it,,g886fmf,A lot of those people are really well off though, and it might be tough for OP to relate. Their mobile homes are really cool, but it's like Tiny Better Homes and Gardens sometimes. r/urbancarliving is more real.
j7z0it,,g889b8a,You got that right. Some of those vans cost more than my house. But I have built two myself for touring with bands going to festivals and long haul, month long trips.   The most expensive thing inside the van was the double sized futon mattress. Everything else was just leftover 2x4s, paneling and wood screws. I bought foam insulation for the ceiling and covered it with slats of poplar, just to have a nice look.
j7z0it,,g88bplo,Sounds nice. Pics?  I want a van. Current SUV doesn't have enough space. Would love a futon in a van. Have some storage too. Maybe a place to use a camp toilet in emergencies. I saw one not long ago with two batteries. Custom.  I'm nearing 40 and have never had a home. Ive been feeling it more recently.
j7z0it,,g88gv65,This was many years ago, I built my first one in 93 from a 10yo Chevy starcraft hi-top I had, I moved the bench seat forward built a loft behind it and took it on tour to see bands all over the US then took it to Alaska. It could fit five backpacks under the loft. It got trashed on the last trip.  When I got back I built a simpler one from a Ford E-250. I made a 2x4 frame that could fit a dozen milk crates under it with a plywood lid and put the futon mattress on top. It had room for two Mt. bikes in back. It was a cargo van, hence the insulated ceiling. It got stolen in MS and they ripped out the frame, stole my bike and my tools and the futon.  Now I have a pickup with a cab and an inflatable mattress. The mattress is the bomb because you can deflate it to make room for other things. Just pull the bikes out, put bags in the cab, blow up the mattress and crash. It is significantly colder though, sleeping on air in a fiberglass shell with no insulation.
j7z0it,,g891wl1,I thought about a truck with a large camper. Does yours have an AC? With winter coming it wouldn't be a priority but being based in Texas anything would be dangerous without one.  Whats the total cost of your current build?
j7z0it,,g89cgny,I actually bought the truck with the bed shell (not a camper), the air mattress was $20 and the pump was $10. I have 2 wool blankets for $10 each. Milk crate stacked along the side of the bed.  I stay in AirBnBs to get cleaned up and have a real bed when I feel like it.

j7z0it,,g8icejh,[removed]
j7z0it,,g8iofqj,Those are really sweet campers. Since I use my truck for parts/tools/ bikes/ packs, having open space in back is a necessity for me.  A camper is just that, a camper. Even if they are 30‚Äô feet long. You have to avoid parking structures entirely, or pucker up under every light and sprinkler head. I‚Äôve come to find that a milk crate full of food under the bed is every bit as functional as those tiny cabinets. It‚Äôs all about your lifestyle but I like to have a couple toolboxes, jumper cables, air compressor, bike tires and spare parts, I also have a fair amount of cold weather gear which doesn‚Äôt hang in 6‚Äù closets. You can buy a toilet that is good for 10-20 uses without water. A Coleman cook stove has two burners and mine has a griddle. I can pack it up and stash it out of the way. Cooking in a vehicle doesn‚Äôt work for me, grease and odors build up fast, Check out campers world and see what that equipment really costs.  For $30k your paying for a ton of shit that you probably don‚Äôt really need, but I would take an empty pop-up shell in a second.
j7z0it,,g8iujd6,[removed]
j7z0it,,g8iz37b,I feel you, but if I put stuff where ever it will ‚Äúfit‚Äù then I have similar use gear stashed all over the place. If I have a plastic tote with every bike part I want, it‚Äôs well organized but won‚Äôt fit anywhere in a camper. It‚Äôs a toss up.
j7z0it,g87y5w3,,Being homeless is nothing but pure hardship and one does not truly understand if they have never lived it. It leads to hopelessness that is extremely hard to build back a life , especially how today‚Äôs society discriminates against homeless people.  It‚Äôs not a life I suggest for anyone..I know this from personal experience as I was homeless in the downtown streets from the ages of 13-18 yrs old and am lucky to be alive.  Homelessness in my eyes should not even be a thing accepted in society!
j7z0it,,g88d9ip,I‚Äôve heard the process of rebuilding after homelessness described by people who‚Äôve exited it as akin to incarceration, in terms of the devastation it wreaks on your personal and professional life as well as your psyche. It is not a LARP; it is not cosplay. It is hardship through and through, and this inquiry is Exhibit A that most of us have little to no idea just how much violence it actually does to a person.
j7z0it,,g8c4k0h,Yes my struggle to regain my life back has been real hardship. I ended up homeless of no choice of my own. I was born into what I call a ‚Äúhouse of horror‚Äùand was taken out apparently for my safety and that is when I became the governments child. With lack of services I ran to the streets of down town Toronto at the age 13-18yrs old. I was exposed to all walks of life and exposed to violent crime.  I made friends with what is known today to be Canada‚Äôs 5th notorious killer And rapist and when he tested 39 out of 40 on the most dangerous offender list. I am lucky to be alive!  I met a man whom was a pimp ( I never worked) but the relationship was extremely violent and he end up fathering 5 of my children ( love them all they are my world) his control and abuse was unbelievable.  I met another man and unfortunately it was extremely violent and plenty of charges were laid including attempted murder...I had one child by him( which I truly love and is one of my worlds)  I lived shelter to shelter when I started having the children and I could get away from my Abusers as they were stalkers  I have attended many and I mean many programs to help me recover from my trauma. I had an issue with binge drinking but have addressed it and have not touched a drop for 15 years now  I am under psychiatric care now for 25 years as I have been diagnosed with mental health issues as of a result  of my past and homelessness   I live in fear every day as flash backs are hard to control.  I have physical issues not just because of the physical abuse I endured but issues with my stomach because of having nothing nearly to eat .  Even though I have been fortunate enough to obtain subdivided housing and have lived in my present place ...I yet have to understand what a true home is about? It‚Äôs more then hardship ...even though I have a bedroom. Most times I sleep on the couch still in disbelief I have a home.  For my safety I got a Rottweiler so I can sleep at night as I fear my Abusers but there is always that fear what if I do something wrong and lose this place?  I apologize for the length of my letter , i just want to get it across the true suffering one can endure just by being homeless.  Best part about this is..my six children I mentioned . Well no matter what I went through I swore to myself none of my children will ever endure what I did...so I kept my word and to date they are all successful young adults with my second last child just graduated with a degree in Finance after completing his diploma and my youngest is in her second year of college on the deans list . I did it with little help from social assistance and subsidized housing and all the help I could get and that included getting my children help as they were the ones that witnessed the violence.  Even though I sit in my own world like a prisoner thanks to the cruelty of others ...I still have the will to speak up and make more awareness on the severe affects on one individual it has when they face homelessness.
j7z0it,g87tro3,,I do think homelessness teaches you something, however. You definitely learn what physical things you really need versus creature comforts.  You learn how little you really need to get through a day, and you appreciate and don't take for granted that you have those few things.

j7z0it,g8864a9,,If you want a community of intentionally homeless people, check out r/vagabond. A lot of focus on train hopping and "crusty kid" lifestyle.
j7z0it,g87z7a0,,No one chooses homelessness.  You are probably looking for r/vagabond
j7z0it,g88nriy,,I think you're going to find two very different perspectives on people *choosing* to be homeless and their experience over those who were forced into it based on circumstance. They're not even in the same sport, let alone the same league.  >I see a lot of complaining here or maybe just wishing to have a physical home. It seems like most people on this Reddit are not happy being homeless.  As ever, you're going to have to connect with people who chose that life as many who have escaped it/not chosen homelessnesss probably aren't going to be inclined to recommend it. Most people who are "homeless" by choice aren't *actually* homeless, they just have different lifestyle choices that don't include a specific address/residence and an income to support the way they *want* to live. The "complaining" you might see here is likely more comparable to severe hardship, suffering, pain, and frustration.
j7z0it,,g88udyv,Yes that word complaining was poorly chosen.
j7z0it,g88s5b2,,Vagabond.  Not homeless
j7z0it,g88w01y,,Homeless by choice VS. homeless by force are two completely different things.
j7z0it,g89dlc9,,it‚Äôs not nearly as fun as you think it is. i‚Äôm currently losing a war against everything I own going moldy.
j7z0it,g8811k4,,I have several friends out here who are very professionally homeless.  There's an analogy that a friend of mine came up with. Think of a Role Playing Game where you start out lost in the woods wearing skimpy clothes and maybe you're armed with a stick. Your goal is to acquire food, armor and weapons. This game is set on beast mode, super hard to level up, very easy to screw up and lose levels.   It's been 5 years since I went from couch surfing to the streets. The time since then has taught me quite a lot, though I'm still nowhere near the top of the player's roster, I'm certainly not at the bottom. Mostly because I'm too old; too old to hike to an ideal spot every day, too old to fight often.   I know how to stay warm and dry, how to stay fed, how to stay clean and get my clothes clean. I have my own ways to hustle up enough cash to buy the necessities and a few niceties.   The best advice I can give: Be nice to your fellow homeless, don't make assumptions. The relationships that you build will become your greatest resource.  Don't drink too much or too often. One good bender can set you way back. Don't do meth, not even a little. Just ask my friend who's scared of heights how he jumped off the bridge to the rocks below. Don't do heroin, fentanyl is serious. Get trained, carry Narcan. Don't smoke weed offered by a stranger, too often it isn't just weed.
j7z0it,,g888rmq,Do you feel being homeless has given you more spiritual insight than would have occured otherwise?
j7z0it,,g88daa4,I can say that corrupt poverty pimp religious organizations have affirmed my atheism.
j7z0it,,g8918zb,If you are looking for spiritual insight, do a week long plus retreat (any tradition will do).  It will force you to confront yourself and see your shit.  There are many that are free/donation only.  What you won't have happen at a retreat is getting beat up, getting your stuff stolen, have people try to manipulate you in the worst ways, be incredibly judged by housed folks.  Streets are not kind, and not a good place to get to know yourself.  It's a good place to get incredibly bitter about the state of humankind.
j7z0it,g8949am,,wrong sub...  r/vagabond  r/vandwellers  r/FullTiming
j7z0it,g89htfr,,the first thing I one must understand is EVERYONE is homeless when we live on earth.  Your 4 walls are built with temporary security in mind.  Now does happiness depend on individual comforts that depends on the individual.  In my case there is a sense of REAL privacy and freedom that comes with this lifestyle.  This does not mean i do not have a safe, quiet, consistent place to sleep every night it just means on ANY particular night I may have to move.  I live a simple life.  This is acceptable to me.  I liken it to any other animal that lives by unconventional "human" waysüòâ
j7z0it,,g8a8gko,Wait what?! I'm going to correctly guess that the majority of society would disagree with your statement that those on Earth with homes are homeless. IF you really did have real privacy and freedom, wouldn't that mean that you wouldn't have to move unless you were the one that decided to do so? See how your statements are contradicting? Just trying to understand
j7z0it,,g8agd4o,Hi Rayne...  The etymology of the word HOME is from HAM which means "dwelling place."  That would mean the earth because it is a place where people live.  In THIS society meaning United States people who live on earth are LABELED erroneously "homeless."  Instead of the proper reference to people who don't pay rent (mortgages) such as yourself.  Just because you live in a house doesn't mean people who live outside one are without a dwelling or place of residence.  By the very definition of this society's mainstream label "homeless" is a contradiction. When I speak about privacy is NO one has my information to my dwelling space UNLIKE yourself and YOU can be found more easily than I.  And yes I'm more FREE within my mind than YOU because I do not have a subconscious fear that if I don't pay rent or mortgage I may lose my house or apartment, I don't fear that some one might break in and steal my things while I'm on vacation, and I NEVER have to worry about Eminent Domain. Hope this cleared up your confusion.
j7z0it,g88v4oz,,When I used to volunteer at a local food pantry I met a guy who called himself a wanderer. He lived it.  A relative of his volunteered one time and said the family had offered him places and he would stay briefly but preferred to be a wanderer.   I friended him on Facebook and keep up with him that way.
j7z0it,g8exi0v,,I recommend packing your shit and trying it out for a few nights. If it‚Äôs something you think you want to do, go for it. If not, you didn‚Äôt throw everything away in the process.

j7z0it,g8aygxc,,I love being homeless... I do seasonal work when I want to, but i mostly just hang out at the river and chill with other like minded folks. City homelessness sucks.  Food banks help, panhandling is sometimes an option. Set goals for yourself, stock up and supplies and hit the road, listen to other travellers, they'll show you the ropes.  Theres a freedom you get from travelling that most people will never experience, and once you experience it, you'll never want to go back.
j7z0it,g99zldq,,I am a semi retired hobo of 50 years.  Started in my mid teens. Being a hobo, or whatever the newer terms for one are, is like oatmeal. You either love it, or hate it.

j8czjs,g8cg379,,Why are you babying an adult man that gives less of a shit about himself than the effort your expending on him?  Move on. This is not your friend. You‚Äôre trying so hard and you‚Äôre wasting your energy. Focus on yourself, just like he said.
j8czjs,g8a9nqi,,That is a lot of backstory.  None of it answers the two most important questions that you have to answer.  Probably just as important though, none of it addresses the question you have to ignore.  The question you have to ignore is "What do you WANT to do to help?"  This question, although seemingly very important, is actually very irrelevant.  The two questions you really have to look at carefully are as follows:    1. What CAN you actually do to help him? 2. What are you WILLING to do to help him?  Now.  As to question two... the answer of "Anything" is not productive in any way.  Both of these questions need a list of specifics.  I did notice how you began with talking about asking him to seek governmental help, and later on you talked about calling his ex-wife and his mother... or rather how you realized it was useless to call his ex-wife and how you did call his mother.  These are indeed things you \*can\* do, but you've already realized that they don't really help his situation.  Regardless of what you choose to do, he has to be willing to accept the help, or he has to be involuntarily committed to some kind of institution to have help forced upon him.  \*Can\* you put your health aside, spend every dollar you have access to, travel to him, and then do everything possible there in person to help him get back on his feet again?  Maybe.  Are you \*WILLING\* to do that though?  Can you contact any and all homeless shelters in the area where he is?  Sure.  Will he go and stay in one of them?  Who knows?  Can you get all of his relevant personal information that would be necessary to apply for work somewhere, and do his job hunting for him?  Sure.  Will he go to any interviews you happen to get for him?  Who knows?  Can you send him any and all of the money you have access to, in hopes that it is enough to keep him off the streets?  Sure.  Will he actually be responsible and take full advantage of that opportunity to get financially independent faster to take the load off you?  Who knows?  The point being... you cannot MAKE him do any of the things that may become necessary for him to do, in order for his life to succeed.  You could find him a place to stay and a job he just has to show up at to claim as his own... but he actually has to agree to stay in the place you find for him, and he has to actually show up at that job you found for it to work.    Maybe... you can make sure that he always has a way to contact you and the outside world.  Maybe you can get a second phone, and a solar battery charger, and send them both to him so that no matter what happens to him, he can always call you, and he can always charge the phone.  Then, at the very least he knows he isn't alone, even when he really feels like he is.  Maybe that is all you can do for him... to be there whenever he needs someone to communicate with.  At any rate, start with those two questions.  Make a list of all the possible things you \*CAN\* do for him.  You can call people.  You can set up meetings.  You can research possibilities (searching for resources that are local to him, how to get on public food assistance, etc).  The distance between you limits this list.  Then, when that list is as complete as possible, you start looking at it to see what you are \*WILLING\* to do, considering every minute you spend on trying to get his life in order, is a minute you can't spend on your own life.  I realize that part of why you are here, is so that other people can fill out this list of things you can do.  And to some degree I am.  However, what can be done for him, is partially dependent on what is available in the SPECIFIC location he is in.  However, there may be more resources available in a nearby town or city, if he is willing to relocate.  He might even be willing to live in a vehicle.  There is an entire subculture out there of people living in cars, trucks, and vans... Facebook groups and websites dedicated to helping people set up their vehicle to make living in them easier, tips on where to park to avoid trouble, etc.  Maybe helping him purchase a trailer/caravan to live in would be the way to go... a little home on wheels.  In the end though, there may not be anything at all that you can really do for him, because you are pretty much on opposite sides of the globe.  I guess this is why prayer appeals to many people, because it gives them a sense of doing something, when they aren't really doing anything at all.
j7cwg9,g83yf5x,,Hey that‚Äôs crazy man!  Please promise to not spend any of that on more tickets ! It would be a shame to try and chase that high again especially when you can use that money

j7cwg9,,g85336x,I do! The past year or so I had been working on fixing my credit up so I could get a credit card for emergencies. The past couple months I had to get a hotel room a few times which is why I owed 580 on my credit card. Normally I pay everything I owe on my credit card by the time the bill comes around but this last month I wasn't able to do that so getting that 500 and making possible for me to wipe clean my emergency card again is awesome considering where I have to sleep.

j5wc0u,g7xd9h2,,I've been living in my Jeep for nearly a year and a half now and I absolutely love it. Since then I've even started a small business and run it all out if the back. It's a challenge but I like to keep things interesting.  Tip, get a garden sprayer for pressurized water. Game changer for me.
j5wc0u,,hyoag75,That is an excellent idea. Putting that on my to do list.

j5wc0u,g7usvbm,,Yeah, it's great until you have mechanical problems. I have a gas leak in engine compartment right now. Dangerous to drive. Car reeks of gas, can't sleep, and gonna cost me $$$$ likely to fix. I cant figure out which is making me sicker: the gas fumes or repair bill anxiety.  Sorry to be a downer. I hope you live welll in your new ride. Just remember to keep a car repair fund. Words from the wise.

j5wc0u,hqbxnjb,,Station wagons are the best car campers. Enough space to lay down, and lowkey enough to where people aren‚Äôt trying to see if anyone‚Äôs living in there. Plus better MPG than vans and RVs.

j5i8rs,g7s9k7z,,Nice try. Rounding us up for extermination.  If you need a solid, well researched number, there are 6. They mostly live in the suburbs. Look for houses with Trump signs. Thats secret code for "homeless encampment".
j5i8rs,,g7s9m2k,Ok
j5i8rs,,g7s9nav,Wait is this serius
j5i8rs,,g7s9y6i,Wait what i want to help people pls dont joke about helping people
j5i8rs,,g7sclx4,You want to help people by wearing a costume?   How would you expect to get the information you requested? Homeless people do not have addresses, you want a sheet of names?   Maybe just ditch the "superhero" and make direct payments to soup kitchens or even money directly to a homeless person you see?  You, wearing a costume in Detroit, while seeking out the homeless, during a pandemic, while riots and protests are taking place does not sound like an intelligent thing to do...
j5i8rs,,g7scply,While im 13 right now im planning on doing this when im older at least 18
j5i8rs,,g7scwkv,Not wise. Not in the execution at least. Its fine to have a desire to help others, but not at the expense of your own safety.
j5i8rs,,g7sd2wg,Well im probably going to have some kind of self defence with me just in cass something goes wrong maybe a tazer just in cass someone attacks me
j5i8rs,,g7sdaca,Admiral that you want to help others but you should be focusing on yourself, your education, working and saving money, unless you happen to be a wealthy benefactor/trust fund baby and these things are of no consequence.
j5i8rs,,g7sdhrv,I want to put others before me all i need is a house a job and a education after that im good and i can help homeless people i want to give people something to smile about
j5i8rs,,g7sdy48,You can't put others before you if you are not in a stable environment. Home, job, transportation, education, bills, potentially thinking about starting a family, etc are all things that require time and money. There is a reason younger people are thought to have the chance to go to school because their "overhead" is generally less then a tenured adult, as well as having the time to do so.  Maybe you should speak to a trusted adult in your family about your plans and take their advice seriously. You can't help anyone if you don't help yourself first.
j5i8rs,,g7se3yq,Thanks for the advice i will make sure i have a stable life before i do this stuff
j5i8rs,,g7tcuh7,If you insist yeah wait till your 18 and take a weapon with you
j5i8rs,,g7sctvm,My plan is to put on my outfit and go find homeless people on the streets and give them blankets and pillows and mony and food
j5i8rs,,g7sdq3h,Do not approach homeless strangers alone. You should talk to your parents first and pitch the idea of helping others and go from there. Your heart is in the right place kid- but your definitely not ready to seriously help those in need at this time.
j5i8rs,,g7sdvxo,Im going to wait untill im at least 18 and if i do do this im going to have a buddy with me and me and him will have teasers in cass we get attacked
j5i8rs,g7td47n,,I left a sarcastic comment earlier. But here is my serious comments it would be safer for you to volunteer with an existing agency or church that does homeless Outreach. You can get to know the homeless people who come out in the daytime for meals and Pantry items for example and it might be a way to determine if this is something you want to keep doing but it will be already structured for you and you can be part of the team there. They'll love of the superhero costume and you'll probably end up in the newspaper.
j5i8rs,,g7tezmd,Thanks for the advice i will consider this but i still want to walk around and find homeless people and give them supplies i have considered safety my plan is i will be with one or two buddys and we will have teasers in cass someone were to try to mug us or attack us but i will consider this safer choice
j5i8rs,,g7tfjb5, your heart is in the right place but this concerns us for so many reasons. There could be a misunderstanding that results in you getting in trouble with the law or hurting someone too. I hope you find a good solution that keeps everyone safety in mind.
j5i8rs,,g7ug55h,Im not going to use weapons unless a weapon is drawn on me and i will use non lethal weapons like a gun with rubber bullets, teasers, and pepper spray
j5i8rs,,g7vid85,[deleted]
j5i8rs,,g7xvvsb,Thanks for the concern i am aware that what i posted is not very specific im going to wait untill im at least 18 and my plan is to give out free supplies to the homeless but you are right i might need more than 2 people do you think 4 people with me would be more safe?
j5i8rs,g7vrozi,,How old are you? I'm really hoping your older than 12. This is a bad idea. Better idea? Go to soup kitchens, food banks and volunteer your time when your not in school. Go to the supermarket and buy food for them, tins etc.
j5i8rs,,g7xvjsq,u/becccssx Im planning on doing this when im at least 18 and have a job im going to be with a buddy and have pepper spray (just in cass we get robbed)this is my way of helping people but thanks for your concern also what kind of sick fuck would troll on a subreddit dedicated to helping the homeless
j5i8rs,,g802pss,Wait when did I say you were trolling? Lmao and you can still help now.
j5i8rs,,g82f2v8,Sorry that was for someone else
j4sles,g7ndear,,Oh that looks like such a great campsite!  Also, kudos that it is clean and we'll kept!  Respect!  Never understood people who burn their own spot by trashing it!  Sleep tight street warrior!
j4sles,,g7nf16o,Dude, just the other night some shithead parked about a block away, chilled for an hour then just threw out a huge bag of taco bell trash, 3 empty energy drink cans, and a single joint tube. I walked over and picked it up but damn why are people like that. He was literally on the side of a mountain
j4sles,g7m7ve6,,If any of you find yourselves in the Vegas area, drop me a line.
j4sles,,g7m9fgm,I'm in Vegas. Where are you staying?
j4sles,,g7matjd,Pahrump! Are in metro vegas?
j4sles,,g7oo8a2,Yeah. How are you doing out there in Pahrump? What's it like being newly homeless?
j4sles,,g7p96xb,I'm more in amargosa valley but pahrump is where I go for supplies, it's hot. Super hot still and at night it hits 41. although, the forecast says the heat should be going slowly starting tomorrow and then it'll be getting pretty cold about 27 average, luckily u/stinkiforeskinboi gave me good tips for dealing with cold temps.   Newly homeless at first was bad, dehydrated anxiety no money etc. About a week in I have the things I need and more so I am very very extremely grateful for it all. I got robbed the other night and all they took was my weed and my pipe but hey at least they left a bottle of water. Couple nights ago one of my friends comes and stops by the spot that I'm staying at and brought me a huge mason jar of bud, a nice glass pipe and bong, some kool aid powder, a plate of dinner, two lighters and a Dallas cowboys necklace because I'm from Texas and he likes the cowboys. Literally made me bust out crying like a bitch right then and there. I'm very grateful for the few people who are assisting me.  Sorry for wall of text  How are things in Vegas?
j4sles,,g7peo0d,Although I've been all over the world for sometime, Vegas is my home so it's just like any other day for me. 11 months into my new job and my anxiety and stress levels are at all time highs. I'm grateful to have enough and a supportive family in case things go awry but I feel like I am suffering from excess. Excess expectations at work and home. Excess amounts of basic livings needs. If only I could take time off work to clear my mind in nature.   I'm glad you are doing better and I hope you can get back on your feet. Everything is about perspective. Though you are involuntary homeless and suffering quite a bite during this stage of your life, try to see the silver lining in all this - you get time to yourself to reflect while being in nature.
j4sles,g7nmqag,,I wish I had a place where I could set up a tent and fire but I'm working tonight so I'm not asleep in my car somewhere atleast not till I get off work luckily I can park my car at my work and there is an outlet outside which lets me run an extension cord through my trunk into my car so I don't have to leave my car running while I sleep (also I'm lucky my place of work doesn't mind for me to sleep in my car in the parking lot lol)  Be safe out there. There is crazy people around.
j4sles,g7mdt6y,,You too, take care.
j4sles,g7m43kx,,Very nice picture. Like the colors
j4sles,g7mtrle,,so freakin cool üôÇ
j4sles,g7oldqg,,I see you have a redmi note 8....I can't seem to find any phone service that will accept mine...if you do have a phone carrier,which one are you on ?
j4sles,,g7ou2kp,If the phone is unlocked, then it should be able to work with AT&T, T-mobile, CRICKET, or Metro by T-mobile.  I doubt it'll work on Sprint, Boost, or Verizon.  All you need is a sim card from the companies I mentioned and it should work as long as the phone itself is unlocked.
j4sles,,g7p9ag2,Yeah this guy is right so far it's worked with Verizon, tmobile and att
j4sles,,g7r9d51,Ahh, thank you.  I've tried cricket and metro but both said my phone service may stop working in the future due to some tech stuff I didn't understand too well . I'm going to give AT&T  a try. Thanks again!
j4sles,,g7rar8m,To be honest, I would disregard the ignorance of some employees that don't know much about phones other than a Samsung or an iPhone. However, like I said if the phone is unlocked (and since it's a Huawei phone) it should be able to work on the networks that I mentioned.   At the same time in order for you to get LTE data speeds, then you'll have to make sure that your APN (Access Point Name) is the right one that works for your carrier. If you need more info on that, then I would suggest looking to Google. It's nothing too complicated really.  I also wanted to mention that the U. S. did ban Huawei, so even though your phone may be unlocked and that you have the right APN; you may still not be able to get the full LTE data speeds. . But again I would suggest doing your proper research on that just to be sure.  And if you're ever in the market for another phone, then I would highly recommend the brand of Oneplus. I've been using the same phone for almost 3 years and it's still going strong despite my heavy usage.
j4sles,,g7t3unn,>I also wanted to mention that the U. S. did ban Huawei, so even though your phone may be unlocked and that you have the right APN; you may still not be able to get the full LTE data speeds.  Okay that makes more sense! After doing my research I've came across lots of people saying the same thing. That's a real  bummer. Well I'll be in the market soon for a new phone and I think one plus will be my go to. How is the camera?
j4sles,,g7uond2,The camera is great! At least for my needs. I currently have the Oneplus 5, which on ebay is sometimes sold for less than $150. (I originally bought it for almost $500 when I first got it). It has 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. It's a beast of a phone and it's incredibly fast (charging wise specially). The battery life is quite good as well.  Nowadays there are other newer models such as the Oneplus 6T (My girlfriend has this phone), Oneplus 7T, Oneplus 8 Pro and so on. They are a bit more pricey, but I've seen many reviews and they seem to be great phones as well. The thing is that I love my the ergonomics of my Oneplus 5 so much, which is the reason why I plan to keep it for many more years to come. But like I said Oneplus overall is a great brand.
j4sles,,g81cvve,Wow! I appreciate your love for tech haha. Thanks for the info man really helpful. I think I'm going to get a oneplus 8 in a couple months....that 12 gigs of RAM and 256 of storage is a beast of a phone.
j2glm4,g7ajxak,,Not saying you should, but if I was homeless I wouldn‚Äôt feel safe without a gun. All it takes is traveling through one bad town and you could lose everything. Also, with the current political climate & uptick in violent crime (cough, cough, BLM) It would probably be a wise decision. The legality of it, I don‚Äôt know.
j2glm4,g75cty6,,Definitely wouldn't want to break firearm laws on federal land.  Best would be for them to read up on gun laws for each of the states they will be traveling through, and the laws for firearms in National Forests/Parks/BLM land. Also, if their guns aren't registered, whether they need to be.
j2glm4,g75hafa,,Entirely state dependent. For instance, in California for the handgun you would need to have a concealed carry permit and break the gun down and placed in a locked box. For a long rifle you can open carry without a permit but it would need to be unloaded. If it's loaded or even accessible there are states for which this would be illegal.
j2glm4,g7a79be,,Where are they going and what do they have?  Method of carry, open carry or concealed, declaring or not declaring.
j2b63p,g75eydv,,Lmao whaaaat?!! I never thought I‚Äôd see my town on here. I‚Äôve lived in Mariposa for 3 years now (living on my family‚Äôs property). I was homeless on and off for years before moving here so I subscribed to this subreddit. Anyways, Mariposa is a beautiful place with lots of small weed farms that need seasonal trimmers from October to December. Pretty easy way to make about 10k. Mariposa is a very small town of a few thousand people but is the gateway to Yosemite National Park so we get a couple million people coming through every year. OP do you live in Mariposa??
j2b63p,g77j70r,,This is awesome!
j2giwe,g75cil5,,Any chance one of the parents is a Veteran? There are excellent resources for homeless Vets across the country. Personally, if I were a homeless civilian on the east coast I might consider Tennessee. The Nashville area seems fairly socially conscious, and it‚Äôs definitely warmer. If they can make it all the way to Georgia, Atlanta might be a worthwhile option as well, more opportunities than most other southern states. Out here in California it is getting insane, so I‚Äôd stay away.
j2giwe,,g75hvg1,We can't be guessing here. We need to here from some homeless or former homeless people who can say for sure which states are better or worse than others and why.
j2giwe,,g76cj4l,I am homeless, and newsflash‚Äîthere are no guarantees, only guessing with this pandemic/election/unrest. Your discouraging help isn‚Äôt helping this family.
j2giwe,,g776j9t,why so? I am trying to find what they want, not what you or I think is best.
j2giwe,,g77iihm,Did you even read what you typed? You‚Äôre asking for advice, and people are only able to offer what they think is best. Especially with being homeless, everything goes out the window, there are no guarantees. Perhaps because you‚Äôre not homeless you don‚Äôt understand. If gate-keeping is the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you‚Äôre providing them, then they‚Äôre just as well off on their own.
j2giwe,,g771hbp,Unfortunately there is no such resource as you desire, I have longed wish there was. States make comparisons difficult to discourage the kind of forum shopping you want to do.
j1eci2,g6ytfk9,,I‚Äôm glad you shared this sentiment! A lot of people unfortunately think that homelessness is struggling by choice when the reality is that those same people are judging people that either don‚Äôt have a home to go back to, and I‚Äôll even entertain the idea of choosing not to have a home, and still feeling contemptuous over them when it‚Äôs not only a heavily nuanced discussion, but also literally something someone sad does.
j1eci2,g705m3q,,In medical school we were required to refer to it as "someone experiencing homelessness" rather than "homeless person".
j1eci2,,g70ja9j,That is encouraging!
j1eci2,,g71ge9r,Also here we use the term house less. Because the land is home.
j1eci2,g6yuzvi,,I had this sentiment until they started having sex on my porch
j1eci2,,g6zplri,Well then they're not neighbors, they're roommates.
j1eci2,,g6zpv7o,in 1967
j1eci2,,g7168ap,I don‚Äôt get it
j1eci2,g71w70l,,My neighbors don't usually piss in my yard, leave their garbage behind, or steal from me.
j1eci2,g6z3swv,,Does that change in phrasing come with anything useful, like housing?
j1eci2,,g6zbjuo,I know what you mean and I expected some would have a negative reaction to this, but posted it anyway because I think it is a net positive...forcing people who hear you to think about the people in this situation, and maybe, just maybe, move them to action.
j1eci2,,g6z9we2,Nope. Just a whole lot of feel good for people who are to busy with their own shit to give the homeless a second thought.  Cant wait till people change their Facebook avatar to solve all this.
j1eci2,,g6zm8qf,Oh, geez. Language still matters. People first language; person before the affliction. "Neighbors experiencing homelessness" is a much nicer way to speak, rather than saying "homeless person". It's the same as saying "a person with autism" instead of "autistic person". As OP said, the affliction doesn't define the person. This way of speaking does humanize people. And recognizing the human experiencing the affliction, whatever it may be, is the first step in people beginning to relate and thus beginning to help. So yes, the way one speaks truly does matter.
j1eci2,,g6zw36l,Actshually, some autistic people prefer to be called autistic people. They see it as their identity.  Really, words are just words until you apply a meaning to them so it depends on the understanding. We prescribe a negative connotation to the term "homeless person" so therefore it carries that stigma..because we put it there. The term is inherently neutral and means what it means -its referring to a person without a home/a homeless person. Using a different phrase to refer to a homeless person doesnt magically make you care or means that you actually do.  I hope people can understand what I'm saying here. Its the energy that matters, including the energy when you do give someone in need something.
j1eci2,,g6znxkd,How do you think humanizing and softening language is going to help?  Do you think people are going to wake up and see street people as their "neighbors" and work to a positive end? So like, theyre going to go "Oh shit. Ive been treating these people like trash my entire life, but they're my neighbors so Ima start making eye contact!".  If you wanna take the "Its a start.." argument fine but then whats the next step and how is this the precursor?
j1eci2,,g6zsu5n,Man, we're all just people trying to be people. None of us has the answers, clearly. Do you? Should we not arrive for humanity since we don't have the answers? Perhaps it would be better to spread negativity and hatred until the answers appear?   Oh, wait .. no, it wouldn't. So until I have the answers and can act on them, I, like every other homed person that actually cares enough to read this subreddit in some attempt to learn how to help, will continue to make any positive changes I can to those around me. Come join us!
j1eci2,,g7008o3,I see. So youre doing us a favor? A non homeless person benevolent enough to check up on us lowly homeless people? Is that your point? You are giving us a new title to feel better about your slightly higher privelage?  Well thank you so much. You have made a difference. Congrats.  Everyone! Can we get a round of applause for this "homed" person? Lets do it. They were nice enough to stop in and let us know we are neighbors.  I do have an idea. Why don't you call us something that doesn't sound like were your fucking friends and maybe actually do something. You ever written a letter to a senator? Rallied for a solution? Started a grassroots movement demanding a solution?  Id keep going but hey. Youre just popping in. Thank you for your company. I know I feel better.
j1eci2,,g700qwp,Holy shit, you're an asshole.
j1eci2,,g71rx96,I very much am. Ive said it elsewhere but I apologize for lashing out.   I cant always spot the rage while its happening. Off to the doc in a bit to reup on dontbeadickanol.
j1eci2,,g70wr0m,I dont know your whole story, but I can tell my realization stirred up some negative feelings from you and for that i am sorry.  Take care
j1eci2,,g71qpcj,I apologize for lashing out.   My issue is I see "good people" talk a good game, but when it actually comes to doing something they are nowhere to be found.  I'm tired of our culture doing nothing under the guise of doing something. Wrapping it up in a nice little box and putting it on the shelf as bought and paid for.  I apologize again for lashing out. I just don't want to be the flavor of the week.
j1eci2,,g730wn6,No apology necessary, but thank you. I share your frustration about words versus action. It feels like the government is letting its citizens down big time when there are people struggling who wouldnt be struggling if better programs were in place. Instead , we just lock people up.  It is sad.  Well, anyways, thanks for reaching out.  :)
j1eci2,,g707u4y,üòÇ great comment.  the this persons post is a microcosm of what the government does for USA üá∫üá∏.  Put a quirky title on something, pat themselves on the back, then retreat back to their comfortable lives. üòé  The poor class in this country is there for a reason.  Bet your bottom dollar if the wealthy or middle class gave a damn about "their" neighbors skid row would disappear in a decade. its called universal housing, health, and food supply to the citizens of the nation.
j1eci2,,g71rfd5,Thats my biggest concern. These horrible, complex issues will be in the spotlight then everyone gets their photo OP with the most destitute among us to post online then the "Well. We helped. I don't know what these peoples problems are. I showed my support for this issue!".  They could call me "big fat floppy donkey dick" if they actually helped.  Actions are what's important. All the feel good language in the world won't change that.  I do want to admit and apologize for lashing out. I could have handled it better.
j1eci2,g6zsdu7,,Virtue signaling at its finest. Rather than reach into my pocket, I‚Äôll call them something less offensive
j1eci2,,g6ztiy6,I reach into my pocket AND call them something more respectful of their humanity AND hope it influences others.
j1eci2,,g7081yk,reaching into your pocket solves nothing.  or else the homeless "problem" would have disappeared by now.
j1eci2,,g6zvfco,Who said people who are using those terms aren't also working on helping homeless people? Isn't that a little presumptuous? There are people who are trying to help homeless people by both talking about them as if they're humans who deserve basic respect, and are also trying to make sure they can be supported by social programs or donations.
j1eci2,,g70wzrj,The person I learned this term from is someone I'm pretty darn sure does charity eventsand work for the charity organization.
j1eci2,,g714gh1,I worked at a community college trying to support our homeless and food insecure students and they wanted to make sure they were helping the students get the help they needed without looking down on them. Dignity was a big thing in my department! We usually said housing insecure or unhoused, but the term you said was good, too!
j1eci2,,g7313j2,I wish lunch was just free for all students for this reason.  Why point out that some students are in financial hardship?
j1nbyt,g70uk46,,Fun. I've never bothered with the shelters. Lots of towns where you can make decent money spanging or busking. Friendly people, easy hop outs. Any place can be a shit hole, and then againcany place can ve alright depending on your skills and mentality.
j1nbyt,gaioxbp,,Just like anywhere else except a little warmer in winter.
j0vjip,g6vie2y,,Damn, and I thought cigarettes were cheap in Kentucky.
j0vjip,,g6vihc0,Trust me, these cigarettes weren't worth the money.
j0vjip,g6w9p6c,,You guys are lucky cheapest cigs in the UK are about ¬£9.30 which I think is around $11.80 usd for 20 smokes  Australia have it worse though think it‚Äôs around ¬£22 a pack
j0vjip,,g6xxh7g,Yeh it‚Äôs $50 here for a pack
j0vjip,g6vfl6e,,Never heard of these. Everyone around here smokes Burley or the Cheyenne cigar things. Those really start to hurt my throat so I found a better brand called aura which they don't sell in the gas stations only the tobacco shop but it's $3 a pack and it's worth the extra dollar
j0vjip,,g6vg3ba,I never heard of these smokes until now myself.  unfortunately, you get what you pay for with these "Edgefield" cigarettes. A very flimsy filter and loosely rolled tabbaco.  Perhaps the harshest cigarette i ever smoked.   Will it do the job? Sure will. Are these smokes worth it?  Absolutely not. Spend an extra dollar or two and enjoy a pack.
j0vjip,,g6vjpll,yeah, georgia is still one of the like 5 cheapest states. i remember getting a carton of newport reds for $45 somewhere north of atlanta off i75 a few years ago.
j0vjip,,g6vk9f3,From my drifting travels, I have found the most "undesirable" or "ghetto" areas of certain states you find these unknown name brands of certain products for the cheapest of prices.
j0vjip,,g6vivis,little cigars have much less nicotine and burn too slow for my liking. i've always preferred rolling my own if cash is limited. a pouch of pipe tobacco (6-8oz) sells from tobacco shops for $1/oz or less, then papers are $1-2/pack. you end up with over a carton's worth for $15-20. getting an injector and using tubes is even cheaper overall, though higher initial cost.
j0vjip,,g6yfgvw,I use an injector tube machine and it's awesome! After the initial cost of $40 for the machine, it cost $7 for 8oz very decent tobacco and $2 for tubes. So $9 a carton, give or take a pack.   Whenever I'm strapped, I can get 2 small bags of crappy tobacco for $2 and pack of 50 papers for about $ .75.
j0hp7s,g6rj30n,,Hey some churches have open free coffee daily. Never hurts to ask.

j0hp7s,g6rbx0q,,Good spot!  Back at you street brother!
j0hp7s,g6r8vlb,,Now that's being homeless! Good find, friend.  Churches are a great spot!  EDIT: Nice timberland socks. I have some Timberland boots that have been very reliable.

j0hp7s,,g71m2sm,out by 6am
j0hp7s,g6v9i89,,This looks like a window wells at the church that hosted the women's homeless shelter. Their boyfriends would frequently sleep in the window wells and meet them in the morning. The window wells were also the place we went to smoke joints away from the security camera and so sometimes it was annoying that somebody was in there already but everybody needs a place to sleep. So we managed.
j0hp7s,,g6va1ug,It sounds nice but that shelter for women is kind of strict and they would actually kick out women when they caught them bringing out coffee and food to the guys early in the morning and called the cops they didn't both leave the property because the rule is during Shelter hours only women were allowed on the property.. The shelter never realized the guys were sleeping on the property but they penalize the women. One of the volunteers figured it out and started sneaking breakfast out to anybody who is hiding on the property Before Sunrise and she got fired :-(
j0hp7s,g6y2qgs,,legit question...ever get peed on?
j0hp7s,,g6y2v26,Fortunately not‚ÄîI‚Äôm camped out in a pretty affluent suburb so there isn‚Äôt a lot of homeless people far south from main city services

izxwzz,,g6tw98z,I volunteer at homeless shelters frequently, I wear gloves and masks (that the shelters provide) and it‚Äôs chill. But I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre taking social distancing seriously, at least !

izxwzz,g6mf9w4,,I recently became housed and I am so lonely. I stay at a college dorm thinking I would make friends. Nope. Stuck inside thanks to COVID. I never felt lonely at the shelter. :(
izxwzz,,g6mg5un,Glad I'm not the only one. Thank you so much for your comment.
izxwzz,,g6mgaxl,It‚Äôs normal to want human interaction. Being homeless changes you in a lot of ways. After being homeless I‚Äôm now desensitized to a lot of weird shit.
izxwzz,,g6mgw6o,I still get unnecessarily tense at loud noises. In the shelter, if people started yelling, something was going down and I had to be prepared to defend myself. In a call center, people yelling is likely a celebration of some sort. I never got used to it.
izxwzz,g6nqz8r,,Never stayed in a shelter, but sometimes I miss the simplicity of the homeless life. Low/no responsibilities compared to being a job-working, tax-paying, citizen; also, the relative lack of clique. I'd forgotten homed people will play stupid social games for shits and giggles.
izxwzz,g6m7etq,,Speaking of side quests have you ever played an mmo? It's been awhile since I have but when I was lonely the comraderie I had with my guild was such a life saver. If you decide to try it out I could give recommendations to different games that might suit you

izx7vr,g6m5qye,,None that I am aware of. Expecting a totally free motorhome may be a bit of a tall order.  &#x200B;  However, if you are mechanically inclined and can fix up an old one, consider working whatever jobs you can and save up some scratch (around $800 or so if you can). A lot of older RVs with very minor mechanical failings can be gotten off places like craigslist or from people you may meet in slightly more rural towns, often for very little money; That's how I got mine.
izx7vr,g6r0a55,,I will say I have seen some bad mobile homes for as little as $700-1000. Bit they are going to need work. I had gotten myself a fifth wheel when i had no where to go with my tax return one year for around 5grand and I had to get a few things fixed still.   Definitely check daily on CL for RVs, tents, cheap shared rooms.

iz49gs,g6gpqsf,,Sociopathic jerks.
iz49gs,,g6h0xt2,One time they came in trucks and tractors to remove us from under this bridge. No warning, at dawn, while we slept.   First the police woke us up by thwacking me on the back of the calve with a Cobra Whip as I lay asleep . Then they hurried us up making me carry my sleeping bag down the hill where a city worker with an orange vest scooped it up and tossed into the bucket of a skip loader. I had to beg the cop standing there to let me get it back while the city guys laughed.  I'll always remember that you assholes.  I wanted to go to that guys house with a tractor , hit him while he slept then load his bed into a dumpster, just for laughs.

iz9tat,g6i7nl5,,Fake. Sorry, you should have developed your history better. "I'm a 14 year old girl who's running away, better get my ducks in a row and start a Reddit account." Sorry sir, you shall not receive my upvote.
iz9tat,,g6i7sth,I don't know what you mean. But okay I don't need useless votes lol.
iz9tat,,g6i98ah,Who runs away and then decides that's the right time to create a reddit account? I second, this is FAKE.
iz9tat,,g6i9sf8,I do. And I second I don't care.
iz9tat,,g6ibn1b,This dude is trying too hard.Total troll. Fake as fuck. Also, he cares. He cares so hard. Pathetic.
iz9tat,,g6j2flp,Imagine saying this to a 14 year old girl who's actually homeless. It's clear you're the one trying to be a troll.
iz9tat,,g6khrv3,Imagine if a taco came to life and farted glitter. I can't imagine a 14 year old being that stupid so, nope, not thinking it possible for you to be someone who ran away and only thought to open a reddit account instead of, say, save money or stay with a friend. You're garbage for taking advantage of people's emotions.
iz9tat,,g6ix8pt,You don't need votes. You need help. I'm late 30s, male, large, and armed. People still fuck with me.  I dont care if youre legit or not. Some other young woman may stumble across your threads and would hopefully use our info.  If you sleep on the streets solo you will he assaulted on a long enough timeline. You very much come across as a know it all child. Trust me. You do not know this. It isnt camping. Its not a vacation. Its brutal and with winter coming it is even more so.  YOU HAVE REAL OPTIONS. Use them. Look at the stats for how many homeless kids go missing every year. The number is high for a reason.
iz9tat,,g6j32p1,I know that odds are highly stacked against me and I know eventually I'll have to either be forced to do something I don't want to or have to make a choice that I'm not prepared for. But even still that doesn't justify someone else saying shit just to make me feel worse. Just because you think you're right doesn't mean I do. Just because I might fail doesn't mean I can't try.
iz9tat,,g6j6458,Might? No. You are failing. Unlike others here I believe you are what you say you are. You are to arrogant and nieve to be anything but.  What's your plan? Lets talk this out. I'm rooting for you. I really am but for the reasons outlined I don't think you understand what's happening to you.  There are long term issues here. How will you make money? Get food? Stay safe? Not freeze? Deal with medical?  People here are being nice to you compared to whats going to happen.
iz9tat,,g6ki7vl,If, IF, this is real, you need to listen to u/funatical. I can't imagine anyone being this foolish, but unless you actually want to seriously suffer, listen to this guy.
iz9tat,,g6kqhfm,Im hoping she does. My oldest is her age. Breaks my heart someone has to go through this.   We can help. We don't want anything from her. That will likely be the last time for quite a while.
iz9tat,,g6j6res,I don't have a plan. I'm taking this one day at a time. And just because stuff is g to get worse is no excuse for people to act like they have. Simply put you and other people here are ganging up on me and trying to bring me down emotionally. You should be ashamed of yourself.
iz9tat,,g6j8qc9,How am I ganging up on you? I'm treating you deadly serious. I'm actually concerned. You need to learn quickly that just because you dont like someones attitude doesnt make them wrong. The street is full of people who will actually gang up on you. They arent your friends. They are competitors. If youre getting butthurt by me you are in greater trouble than you realize.  You need a plan even if its short term. What does food look like? What is the temp where you are? What supplies do you already have?  You can either keep bitching about how people are treating you and lose what little help you may get or you can talk this out and increase your odds of surviving. Up to you. I'm happy to help but Im not going round to round with mean redditor bad! If someone is nice to you on the streets its usually a ruse to gain your trust. Your age, your vagina, these are reasons to take advantage of you.
iz9tat,,g6j8gfo,No we're not ganging up on you, we're trying to help you not become another statistic (or some other person who may stumble on this if you're a troll). You see it as ganging up and bringing you down emotionally because you're young and in a really shitty situation. Please trust us if you're truly in the situation you say you are; go to the police and they will help you get to child protective services, this is what they're hear for.
iz9tat,,g6j8pyq,Stop fucking telling me what to do.
iz9tat,,g6j9prl,then go write a blog away from a sub-reddit to vent if that's what you need to do. Because posting like you are on a subreddit that most people use for advice about homelessness and getting mad when you get advice is very illogical. What do you expect? People on this subreddit are mostly kind people who just want to help, so you're options are: listen to us, stop posting here and post elsewhere, or continue to post and just keep getting the same advice. Either way good luck, as it seems you are dead set on not listening if you are who you say you are.
iz9tat,,g6j9tvg,You're literally still telling me what to do. Just leave me alone.

iyl89y,g6di9kh,,Wonderful write up that is, sadly, very true. At least in my state, homeless people can get help with shelter, addictions, mental illness, etc. I guess I'm fortunate to be stuck here during Covid - I was on my way out West.
iyl89y,g6f4sgq,,Diggity.  To add to the church addiction platforms, everyone relapses. Their response is further punishment for being human.   I worked behind a shelter. Many came looking for food because they tested positive. It is very non Christian to punish people like that. It makes sobriety harder and incentives deception.
iyl89y,g6dpe22,,This really depends on where you live, but any state with decent Medicaid coverage usually has a good amount of Suboxone or Methadone clinics. I‚Äôm not a fan of Methadone only because you‚Äôre required by law to go every day and they are usually high barrier. Suboxone costs $1 a pill (usually free for Medicaid) and I‚Äôve seen people go from borderline nonfunctional to coherent and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in 3 days on it.  Detox and inpatient is mad expensive and hard to get into, so it‚Äôs been awesome to have MAT. I couldn‚Äôt agree more about way too much religion in outreach and recovery. So many of them are anti-MAT even though the recovery rate is 5-10% for abstinence and 50% for MAT, and there‚Äôs literally no reason that people can‚Äôt do both if they want.
iyl89y,g6g21zz,,A friend was recently homeless and to stay at the shelter meant mass 3 times a week for hours. And you could only stay for like 3 months.  I found there were no non religious shelters in my state basically. Maybe like only 1. That really disgusted me how they took advantage of the vulnerable.
iyl89y,il9e8ek,,My first rehab. At 18yo was Teen Challenge.  If it had been. Something less culty I may have stayed clean and not run away.
iyqk4d,g6k7auh,,I don't think running away is the answer. Instead, if you got a cellphone, even a $30 one from Walmart without service, will record audio and video. DOCUMENT EVEYTHING. Stuff like at 6:33pm June 32nd they did this to me... Documenting EVERYTHING will assist your Dad in getting custody of you.  You don't want to be 14 and homeless, nothing good ever comes from that.
iyqk4d,,g6msi55,Ok thxüòÅ
iyqk4d,g6eeqf3,,In many places you are old enough that your wishes will be considered by the judge. You just have to find a way to get the information to the judge. Maybe look into free legal help by phone. You can call the state lawyer bar association and ask for resources.  Be careful what you wish for. Things can seem worse than they are where you are and better elsewhere than they are.   You REALLY don't need to be running away. It is deadly scary out here even for adults who know what they are doing, mostly. As long as you are in no real danger, stay home. If it gets physically dangerous or you start thinking about ways to hurt yourself, talk to a counselor at school or even a cop.  As soon as you feel you can, as long as your grades are good, get a job and save as much money as you can. Have a very good fireproof hiding place and assume your siblings will be looking for it, even if they aren't.
iyqk4d,,gcyfmzf,Ok
iyqk4d,g6ghejt,,Trust me- speaking from experience as a former runaway in Oregon‚Äîas a minor you dont want to run away. Without an ID you‚Äôre not even able to get a part time job when you turn 15-16. The DMV requires a parents signature to get one‚Äîassuming you even have access to your vital records. What invariably happens is you‚Äôre intercepted by an informant‚Äîusually a concerned citizen or wherever you‚Äôre loitering‚Äîyou‚Äôll be picked up, booked in the local Juvi‚Äîand you‚Äôll end up in the jurisdiction of child protection services or CPS aka ward of the state‚Äîthere you go through the foster care round robin most likely‚Äîcause everyone wants to adopt another teenager right? Lol   You‚Äôll cycle in and out of foster parents that might be just as bad or worse than your current situation (or like me you get shipped 2 states away to a private NGO where its kinda similar structure to an orphanage‚Äîgroup housing bunk beds in an institution) until you‚Äôre 18‚Äìthat may or may not be better than your current situation as you describe as abusive. But just prepared to spend hours and hours meeting with adjudicators in mental health, social work, law enforcement and the courts if your parents contest it. Sometimes when you take into account a cost-benefit analysis one situation might be better to tough out than an alternative. The one silver living to foster care is when you‚Äôre 16 you can petition the court for emancipation if you can demonstrate a game plan for self sufficiency i.e. barring any things like mental illness or bad behavior while you‚Äôre in the system...  Good luck!
iyqk4d,,g6ghpbf,Ok thx for the advice
iyqk4d,g6m2cx6,,Before you run away give CPS a call and there's also [1800runaway.org](https://www.1800runaway.org)
iyqk4d,,g6m2kx9,Cps didnt help when my cousin got choked by his mom so i dont think they would help now. I‚Äôll checkout the website though
iyqk4d,,g6m75ds,I've heard stories about CPS and have some experience. Most importantly I was removed from a foster home and it was shut down by CPS due to abuse allegations (not mine) and so will say that I think they do try to do the right thing. But for you when things get bad for you they are there and yes there are many organizations who's sole mission is to help homeless teens. I use to work for a homeless shelter for teens btw.
iyqk4d,,g6m7amd,So should i run away if my dad loses? Some ppl have said not to so idk
iyqk4d,,g6phy8p,I don't think you should run away but I also don't know your situation at home and if you feel safe there or not. You should at the very least call the runaway hotline before you make any decision to run away. They should be able to guide you and give you the information you need to stay safe.
iyqk4d,g6ehvqj,,Get an evidence they hurting you and go to the police  with it.
iyqk4d,,g6fcjvl,Police in my state dont care. My cousins get choked by there mom and cops do nothing.
iyqk4d,,g6feoer,Its hard to think but i think your dad can get your custody if you have evidence of she hurting you or relatives of your dad can help you at this point.

iyqk4d,,g6g1cfc,Ok
iyqk4d,g6edg1d,,You‚Äôre 14 and people will try to take advantage of you. Regardless of how mature you are, people will try to hold power over you. This is the most important thing you need to understand.   Best bet is legal counsel. Lawyers are required to do pro bono work 1-2 times per month. So you can get legal advice for free. I believe it‚Äôs in one hour sessions. If you want to live with your dad, the legal counsel can give you and your dad advice on making it happen. If you want to go another route, there are special shelters for youth under 25. At 14, you might go to a group home or foster instead of a shelter.  Another resource is 211; assuming you‚Äôre in the US.

ixwzmu,,g6ajcpt,Sometimes the first upvote counts as a downvote I think. I don't know why.
ixwzmu,g69juqg,,Yeah a soup kitchen you typically go in there and get in line, eat a meal cafeteria style whereas a food pantry is something else. A food pantry typically might run once a week or once every two weeks depending on the place. They give more stuff you would prepare at house. They typically give out boxes of pasta, sauce, peanut butter, assorted canned goods and lots of non perishable stuff. You might be able to get certain things there but I've really found pantries are intended for those with somewhere to cook. Whereas a soup kitchen you just go in and have a hot meal. You need to get a list. You can typically go online and get the list (usually a long list like it'd be a packet if u printed it). It will have the list of ALL such services in your area with times and dates. I don't know about other places but none here run everyday. It would be a challenge to survive solely on these services as it would involve a lot of traveling. One might run the 2nd and 4th tuesday of the month from 1pm-4pm in one town, then another might be every Thursday at 2pm-5pm in a different town. Etcetera. All different. Your best bet would be to obtain such a list for your area. And also to try and go obtain a foodstamp card. Typically if you go to your department of human services and you are homeless or not working you can often get the card that same day. Likely it would take lots of paperwork and some hours of waiting but you would then have your own card you could go use at almost any store to buy the food you desire. Between foodstamps and the other services you should be able to eat okay. Just be cautious how you spend foodstamps as you need to store certain foods, things go bad, and most instantly eaten stuff is expensive. Also with FS you can not purchase "prepared foods" aka hot stuff. Like if a market has a deli area with say heated chicken in a warmer or a gas station with hot sandwiches those are excluded but most other stuff is fair game. Get a FS card as it will help you immensely during this time. Good luck. Ive spent my fair share of time homeless and know it's not easy especially at first to navigate.
ixwzmu,g6a3diz,,With a soup kitchen, just be prepared to wait in line and arrive early, like very early.
ixd5cu,g668p2a,,By the way, you can put ramen in room temperature water and let it sit. It'll still turn into noodles as good as the cooked kind.   I've noticed those vienna sausages are crazy cheap on [walmart.com](https://walmart.com) and amazon.com.
ixd5cu,,g66j6as,I was at a local dollar general. Much cheaper there. Haha
ixd5cu,g66397p,,Lol bubble tape and chew. Nice combo
ixd5cu,,g663j7f,I mix it. Its such a great combination. The wintergreen chew matches perfectly with original flavor bubblegum.
ixd5cu,,g67a5yj,So you literally mix the two together and put them in our lip?  Or do you put the wintergreen in you lip then chew gum at the same time?  I have hear of redman (actual chew) and gum but never dip (grizzled wintergreen) and gum.
ixd5cu,,g68k37h,Sure do. Grab yourself a good pinch and mix it in with a  glob of bubblegum and just chew like you normally do with gum. Its delicious.
ixd5cu,g66kgfb,,Find the lasagna
ixd5cu,,g66kvsl,Homeless lasagna? One can of spagettios. Layer two cans of Vienna sausages on top. And then add a can of chef boyardee ravioli.
ixd5cu,,g66po9n,Chef Boyardee lasagna is same price as ravioli and better
ixd5cu,,g66pxae,I haven't seen the lasagna yet. I thought it was a joke. I looked it up. There is a lasagna.  I may have to check that out!
ixd5cu,,g66vp7g,It's the best of the whole line and when I know I'm going to be broke I buy a dozen of them
ixd5cu,,g66vrj2,You sold me. Perhaps your destination in life could be a salesman.

ixd5cu,g67kqb7,,thats good work food. lunch time, pop the can open and go to town.
ixd5cu,g68tg7g,,Vienna sausages all the way. Gourmet like nododys business. Love the spaghettios!
ixd5cu,,g68u5u9,The best part of Vienna sausages is sucking out the juice from the cans.

iwsbw6,g62tavm,,Hygiene Only Prevents Epidemics.
iwsbw6,g657msk,,Ya the word hope for people just needing to take a shit is really telling something of society today.  Sounds good though, I know its hard when you gotta scramble to goto the bathroom on any day. Because we homeless only shit on the weekend.  Let me know what area too, cause right now in CA its super hard to take a shower unless you can get to a truck stop or homeless shelter.
iw0isr,g5v6zkm,,can you look for a used vehicle to live in? van dwelling is the shit: i do it üôÇ ...otherwise look for tent campable areas on google maps: i recommend Ventura county.
iw0isr,,g5vs384,If it was just me, I'd prolly do it. I have my kids and they need more. Van life sounds amazing, tho.
iw0isr,g5xw1hs,,Try Long Beach  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.transitionalhousing.org/ci/ca-long_beach
iw0isr,g5yrwxs,,I'm sure you are doing so already, but use your kids as the driving force to get out of this situation and on your feet. I'm going to look into some resources for you and get back to you. Give me a couple of hours as I have an exam, but I promise I will get back to you with what I find.
iw0isr,g61gpli,,Do you have any income at all right now?
iw0isr,,g627tgj, I have some from financial aid. Not enough to afford a place.
iuppki,g5r5mxb,,Good to know! And it looks delish! Thanks for the tip
iu792d,g5j98x4,,What do the participants get out of it? Being homeless is a full time job, people should be compensated for their time.
iu792d,,g5m4u69,Good question, I was going to ask, once I got PM'd, how I may assist the person who is helping me.
iu792d,,g5m6y91,I actually advocate for housing issues every year in my state. I'm willing to answer questions as long as you provide a gift card or something to someone currently homeless.
iu792d,,g5jvju2,In Seattle it is common for compensation to homeless, for instance, with food, gift cards, by the state University, social agencies like churches
iu792d,,g5k3jqx,Haha nice hustle
iu792d,,g5kquia,Yea. It sounds like they want us to do their homework for free.
iu792d,,g5m50eo,Sorry if it sounds like that! I in no way wanted to seem like I am making someone do my work for free.
iu792d,,g5m9bzl,Sorry if I sounded serious.  I was just joking.  And others probably were just jokimg also.  We're homeless in the middle of a pandemic, so our sense of humor can be a bit off.  Good luck with your studies.
iu792d,,g5jt6ar,I was going to say that if this was for high school, then payment would be a little crazy to request, but since I'll clearly for college, this is a valid question!
iu792d,g5j5csv,,What is the project for?  Or who is it for?  Since this is your only post I was questioning validity!
iu792d,,g5jtcui,Given their username, I reckon it's for their capstone course for their Master's maybe? Regardless, it's for college credit. Just my thought, anyway.
iu792d,,g5m59ax,This project is just for a class! It's for class credit.
iu792d,g5jtpg0,,Oh yes..I am slowly but surely catching on!  Thanks
itfn6f,g5e8ert,,You have stamps? In my state they will give a man $50 for 3 months ($150) every 3 years.  Ive been asked why I don't have them. Now is bad. Tomorrow may be worse.  I feel its built for that. False charity.
itfn6f,,g5ed85j,u/fanatical I fully understand your position. And I dont disagree.   Eating warm food can be a game changer, albeit temporarily.
itfn6f,,g5edzv2,Oh yeah. I'm all for it. I survive of canned food for the most part out of habit. I became accustomed to eating it cold. People will ask "Did you want to hest that up?". I growl at then as I finish.  I kid. A hot meal changes how you feel. I put it in the "luxury" column.
itfn6f,,g5exd45,It is. Absolutley it is. So it's a reason to be glad for someone somewhere.
itfn6f,,g5gt6hr,Im stoked. I have yet to see it in my state but progress is progress.  Remember when all corner stores had microwaves? First bout homeless I realized they didn't anymore. That was a weird realization.
itfn6f,,g5r96ef,Yes I remember. I have my theories as to why they dont show love like that anymore.
itfn6f,,g5rektg,I don't even know when it happened. Their existence is a fading memory.
itfn6f,,g5f531y,Get a camp stove. 30 bucks off amazon. Delivered in lockers, certain areas. But propane tanks or butane (certain camp stoves do both). Cook food every so often.  I know... Having a job is a big part of having money.  Keep your heads up. Your situation does not make you a bad person, your choices in situations do.  Be good people, regardless of circumstances.
itfn6f,,g5faetn,Great positive response. Thanks!
itfn6f,,g5fbkfe,I cant tell if thats a passive agressive response or not, hut you are welcome.
itfn6f,,g5guam6,Ive been looking at those off and on. It see a like a luxury. During the summer the inside of a car can be absurdly hot and I always worry about that being an issue. I found one yesterday for cheap. Going to pull the trigger.  Im retreating into the woods after I mail off my ballot. I have acquired enough stuff. I'll be fine for a month. Ive been homeless a few times and know how to prepare better than the first time it happened. Im ready. Terrified, but ready.  People treat it like camping. The tools may be similar but the concept is much different.
itfn6f,,g5ey0xc,I like your nickname.
itfn6f,,g5guhfr,Lol. Its a derivative of my first username 20 years ago. It was "funetical". I delete every few years and start over.  Awesome to see another with the same thought. Do you sign things "fan"? I always sign things "fun".
itfn6f,,g5gvup4,I will now!
itfn6f,,g5h3smy,Lol. Good deal.
itfn6f,,g5ffbkp,To whom is this directed?
itfn6f,,g5fn2ei,My ‚Äúnamesake‚Äù.
itfn6f,,g5faa8g,Same!  I agree!  You down for cold Beefaroni!  Yes my fav!
itfn6f,,g5gtlub,I blew out on ravioli and spaghettios when I was a kid.  Beefaroni? BRING IT.  I grew up in my grandmother's kitchens. Depression cooking teaches you a ton.  I also have a habit of finishing others meals, mainly my kids. "How does daddy feel about wasting food?".  "Dont.".  "Great! So whats up with all this pizza crust?".  "Ugh. Save it for later. Make pizza crust cinnamon toast.".  "Correct.".
itfn6f,,g5fa4mg,That is horrible!   In Texas it is 194 for single adult...no hot food not even a cup of coffee.  A hot meal is a real luxury!
itfn6f,,g5g6b6y,Only hot fast food becomes a luxury. Nothing you make yourself starts out hot
itfn6f,,g5gtsbt,The ability to heat it up is problematic. There are options but if I were caught building a small fire they would fine me at best. Put me in jail at worst.
itfn6f,,g5hjv4a,Grilllll
itfn6f,,g5kutjd,Im looking for one.  I'm about to dissapear into the wilderness. That should open up some options.
itfn6f,,g5gtxbx,Food seems to be cheaper here. Ive travelled the west and the midwest. Prices are higher on everything. Thats no an excuse.
itfn6f,,g5ejq00,Which state?
itfn6f,,g5em9pd,Texas.
itfn6f,,g5eoe5p,Yeah, I don‚Äôt know which Texas you live in, but the one I live in you get $192. Also the timing restriction (while always awful) has been lifted because of COVID. Apply for them again now, you should have them for a good bit of time.
itfn6f,,g5gv90y,Huh. 3 years ago I worked with a social worker (first long term homeless) and that was what was offered.  Is it forever or is there a cap? I'm talking to another social worker today. I'm moving on it.  Thank you. I eat on $20 a week or less. I'm gaining weight and feel gross.
itfn6f,,g5gz9rh,If you're working you might get less. But if you weren't working and this social worker only got you $50 in food stamps a month... they should be fired.
itfn6f,,g5h626g,I would have been working. It's just recently that my disability has prevented me from doing so. I want to say at that time I was making about $12 an hour.
itfn6f,,g5htqdf,Yeah, so how much you got was affected by how great your "need" was perceived to be. But if you reapply now, you should get a solid chunk of change!
itfn6f,,g5kupdh,My social worker is moving on it. I know I could do it myself but I'm going for disability so its important they are involved.  I got rejected by food banks in my area for not having proof of residency. An Amazon packing label won't work.
itfn6f,g5etogh,,Hey guys so I realize this is just one place in the universe of our Food Stamp use but its still a point for our side. Maybe other places will catch on. Lets just go ahead and say they will.
itfn6f,g5eypnh,,Omg I would LOVE this. I get 198 a month and hate that you cant get prepared foods on it. Im homeless so the only way I can cook is leaving stuff on the dashboard of my car in the hot sun
itfn6f,,g5f0i2j,I know how time consuming and "uphill in the wind" that is believe me. Ive defrosted many a Dollar Tree Dinner on a Dash. Another, better option will be made available to you soon.    I should have asked the proprietors whose bureaucratic dick they had to suck to provide such a "luxury."
itfn6f,,g5f28x2,Not sure if this helps but I‚Äôve noticed lots of gas stations have a microwave for the food they sell. Most cashiers probably wouldn‚Äôt care/notice if you used it for a microwave dinner
itfn6f,,g5hewjh,I do this
itfn6f,g5fq18b,,Awe... Shakespeare said don't expect anything and you will never be let down...I am gonna see what he said about hope.üòÅ. Still cool. I may head your way!
itfn6f,,g5fqz7e,Hit me up when you get here.
itfn6f,,g5fv5gc,"Oft expectation fails, and most oft there where most it promises and oft it hits where hope is coldest, and despair most fits."  "Come gentleman! I hope we shall drink down all unkindness."
itfn6f,,g5fwo2q,OMG...wya?    You are the only other homeless person I know who likes Shakespeare!!!  What's your favs?
itfn6f,,g5fyx93,This is very selfish of me....but what I love is how I feel when I read it. In my head or out loud.  My mouth is full of jewels when I read Shakespeare. (Thats Frank McCourt, not me. But its an excellent simile.)  I could choose a favorite in Shakespeare about as soon as I could choose a favorite star.
itfn6f,,g5ggin7,This is the coolest comment thread!
itfn6f,g5epcm9,,This is great finally.
itfn6f,g5hf5y1,,Great can we have salad bars back too? I miss my salad. My nutrition has greatly decreased and so have my food stamps ever since they put down all the salad bars. I could get a great high protein good salad with nuts and chicken and bacon and cheese and veggies for less than $3 and now I can't anymore.
itfn6f,,g5r8xls,I hear you loud and clear.
itfn6f,g5eqc3d,,Never made any sense to begin with. A lot of places have microwaves for cold food you just bought. I even remember asking about rotisserie chickens, you can buy the cold ones with EBT but not the ones in the hot case?!   Someone, somewhere decided that poor people shouldn't eat hot food. ü§∑
itfn6f,,g5heu9o,It's because hot food has technically been prepared which is labor and the food stamps don't pay food preparation people. All just a technicality because the deli sandwiches I buy were clearly prepared too.
itfn6f,,g5ilxkk,Yeah, everything in the grocery store was made by people: grown, processed, packaged, ordered, shipped, stored, stocked, and rung up by people. Even when machines did the work, people designed and monitored production. That argument never should have survived the first three minutes of the food assistance bill drafting meeting.
itfn6f,,g5es77z,I know. Its just another tactic to keep us hating our lives so we dont become the formidable threat
itfn6f,,g5etl4b,July 23, 2022: We knew this would happen, it all started after Wisconsin started letting people use EBT for hot foods and some guy was able to buy chicken strips from the hot case instead of another turkey sandwich. It seemed innocuous at the time, but now the entire country is on fire, roving bands of merciless killers are sweeping through what's left of the cities. The police are all gone and what's left of the military has been called back to protect the DC area. If only we had taken a hard line on the gas station jalapeno poppers when we still had the chance...
itfn6f,,g5evevo,That was damn decent. Cinematic. So funny it makes me frown with seriousness.
itfn6f,,g5feyjk,I can't credit for how ridiculous the underlying situation is, but thanks!
itfn6f,,g5ffo8z,I know.....I know....but fuck man......Im saving that one. I might put that shit on a T shirt someday.
itfn6f,,g5eu9a3,XD holy shit!
itfn6f,,g5ex7sj,Thats how I felt!!
itfn6f,g5f9ryt,,What??? Is this true???  Is this in all states?
itfn6f,,g5ferp2,Sorry u/SnowMcCall.....I wish it were so.  I realize this may upset some of us because it's a localized post, and this isnt offered everywhere....YET. But still.....it's cool.
itfn6f,g5gejbh,,I'm in San Jose, I'm try to make note of places that serve ready made meals and hot food for EBT. Because they change a lot, I won't list them here, but feel free to message me your location and I can see if I can find a local place that currently has hot food for EBT.
itfn6f,,g5r9dd0,Wow. Damn way to go buddy.
itfn6f,g5gi7e9,,Definitely now that I drank two 32 oz beers, fought 2,000 mosquitoes and don't get any hot food.... I believe this is a passive aggressive response and knee jerk response of overwhelming jealousy.   ü§£
itfn6f,g5ghu1s,,I use to tell my kids that i didn't care where I went heaven or hell...as long as I sat on next to Shakespeare.  Now I just hope he is a Christian!  I figure In my heaven he is there.  My favs are Mid Summers Dream, The Tempest and The Twelfth Night.    By the prickling of my thumb, something wicked this way come.  I love Shakespeare an Insults too!  Man he would shred people if need be!  I sure wouldn't have battled him in words...king of the Wordsmiths!

istq1s,g5aj5h8,,And not to mention in order to be remotely employable, you need to be well rested,  eating regular meals, and, have a secure place to store clothes, uniform, work equipment etc...  So just get a job but you have to  * be back at the shelter by 3PM to wait in line for 4 hours.  If you get a bed you will be 3 feet from each of your closest bunk mates coughing and snoring, from COPD and chronic lung disease all night. There will be people coming all night to go outside  smoke, and getting into fights. * Theres a pretty good chance you might get turned away left on the  street that night because the shelter is  full, and your not getting a shower. * Offered Night Shift? forget about it shelter is closed in the day. * Meals are across town  once a day at 12:00 Noon at the soup kitchen. First paycheck doesn't come in for 2 weeks, so your tempted to shoplift food. * You will be taking all your belongs with you to work in a big old crusty backpack, so they don't get stollen. * This bottom feeder temp agency knows how impossible all this is and would be glad to hire you because they know just how desperate you are, and how much they can exploit you.  They tell you be outside the shelter when an unmarked white van shows up at 5:00AM, but won't say where they are taking you to work, let alone what the name of the temp agency is, probably because they are involved in shady stuff.  Pay is never enough, or stable to get you off the streets let alone afford a crappy motel room, and the work is back breaking.  So you get creeped out and refuse.
istq1s,,g5aktg1,The system is designed to kill us
istq1s,,g5df3ta,I think that system is called Capitalism... or right-wing agenda
istq1s,,g5bs8z3,I'm just researching homelessness and the information that u gave me gives me a clear picture of what homless people have to go through to get a job. Sounds to me that it is almost impossible to secure a job. Wow I did not know that. Thanks fo sharing.
istq1s,,g5e6za8,What is needed are a trifecta of supports that empower someone to be  1. Employable in a meaningful and sustainable context to the extent of ones abilities that at least meets basic needs. 2. Able to be housed, and keep that housing. Secondly Access to affordable housing, in proximity to public transportation. Barriers such as credit, debt owed to prior landlords, eviction history, and convictions often prevent people from obtaining housing, and must be addressed.   If people cant afford, or get approved for housing, no matter how much they work.   Then there is no escape from homelessness for them. 3. Housing retention.   Some people need additional supports, and case management to prevent, and resolve issues that may cause them to loose their housing.   For example if someone is prone to hoarding, conflict with neighbors, paying rent or bills on time, or sending required documents to a housing authority.  A little extra help from a social worker can go a long way in keeping them housed, and preventing a cycle of returning to homelessness.  Housing First model is the gold standard for addressing this problem, and is a result of every study on homelesness.  What we have in America is a system that ranges from Housing First at best , to watered down attempts due to lack of resources. At worst we have a systems that resemble  the English poor laws of the 1500's, criminalizing homelesness and  condemning people to languish on the streets or in shelters. Then  attempts to shame them into essentially penal labor to be eligible for help.  In this case it is a system that doe  little  or nothing to help people move forward.  The cost of leaving people to languish on the streets or in poorly run shelter systems is enormous, due to increased usage of emergency services, and untreated chronic health needs. This paired with rough living, and poor nutrition results in expensive hospitalizations.  These conditions also lead substance abuse treatment when people  turn to self medication.  The cost of running a shelter system is also enormous.     Placing people directly into housing without preconditions has a lower cost burden to tax payers.  What we cant afford to do is maintain the status quo.  Finally we have to look at prevention of homelessness.     It is an even lower cost burden, and better for everybody if we just look at why people become homeless and prevent it from happening to begin with, or at least make it rare.    Especially with a society that is so unforgiving and almost sets up a large number of people up to fail unless they have some kind of support whether thats from the state, or family.
istq1s,,g5fp1e8,Yesssss!!! Education going on with these in-depth comments üëèüëèüëèüëè
istq1s,,gn8w3m5,This comment explains a lot! Many people do not understand this unless they experience it themselves.
istq1s,g5akit1,,A job isn't enough to pay for rent and food. People don't get it.   I know I had it a lot better than most people, I was "homeless" (car dwelling) for all of 2018 & 2019. I was working 30 hours a week and was a full time student and I couldn't afford rent.  Ironically, when I quit my job and started filing for unemployment this year, an opportunity came up for me to rent a shared room.  I've been housed the entire time I've been unemployed, yet homeless while I worked every day.   A housed person's life can change in a single day and they have no idea. But on the flip side, you just need one day of good luck to get off the street, hang in there!
istq1s,,g5bv610,U can‚Äôt get unemployment if you quit your job. I‚Äôm confused how u got it
istq1s,,g5bylx0,It's not really your business but... I was working somewhere and then offered a better job. So I gave my notice. I gave myself a week vacation between leaving the old job and starting the new one.  During that week I got in an accident and broke my back. It took about 3 months to recover, during that time I went on disability. When I was cleared to return to work my new job had already hired someone to replace me and the position wasn't open anymore. I started looking for work but 2 weeks later Covid happened and everything shut down. I said I couldn't find work because of Covid and was approved.
istq1s,,g5akovd,Yeah
istq1s,,gdl1y8h,If a job isn't enough to pay for food and rent, how are people who are not homeless making this happen?
istq1s,,gdl33pa,Living with family, working 2-3 jobs, or have a degree or training to work at a higher wage.
istq1s,,gdl3bnq,I lived alone, in a shared housez working 40 hours a week in a basic retail job. Still could afford the shared house and food. It's not all doom and gloom, even if sometimes it does feel like it.
istq1s,,gdl3w7s,That's cool for you. There are many places, like California, or circumstances like having children, medical bills, or debt, that make this impossible.   Many people are homeless because of circumstances and misfortune, not because they didn't work enough or are lazy.
istq1s,,gn8xmgg,Or having a medical conditions that makes it impossible to handle 40h of work. And not everyone can just get a disability. Medical system is messed up, and sometimes doctors can‚Äôt even figure out what is wrong, and the only solution they offer is to take bunch of pills that make you further very tired and worn out.
istq1s,g5bjgqb,,Yeah, like the only question they as you when trying to rent an apartment is "Do you have a job?".  I had a full-time job making $47,000/year and still couldn't get into an apartment (I'm in the Seattle/Redmond area.   Still can't get anyone to rent to me, even though I do work on a freelance basis now.  Now, the excuses I hear are not only do I not have a rental history and a co-signer, but that my income is also not at least 2.5x the rent and is also not reliable enough.  It's almost like they don't want to rent to you at all.
istq1s,g5axd85,,Many employers think they're too good to hire homeless people.   Many homeless people *do* have jobs, but still can't afford basic living conditions.   Many places require ID to rent, or apply for some jobs, and many of the homeless don't have documents. Personally, I lost my docs while homeless, and it's made me more helpless than being broke has, even after living indoors, again.
istq1s,,g5b1pax,Yeah it's hard
istq1s,,g5b6yvh,Yes true that!  Many business owners hate us where they don't even want us on their property.  I hear often, the employees like and respect me but owner knows I am homeless and wants me gone.  Even after making purchases, I will be asked to leave.  You think these closed minded peoe are willing to give me a chance?
istq1s,,g5bsekd,That sucks man.
istq1s,g5b6jah,,Anecdotally Ive held a job for the vast majority of the four years I was homeless and have in fact climbed out of being homeless twice because the jobs I had at the time gave me enough to do so comfortably.  Issue is, having *a* job isnt the same thing as having *stability*. The two jobs I had that I was able to pivot into apartments were both literally lying to me about being "permanent" and once I was in position to take advantage, like clockwork they closed shop and told everyone to fuck off.  Granted the second time I actually got myself fired (for telling some Karen what everyone wishes they could tell such persons) but even if that hadnt happened that would have only bought me an extra month there.   So yeah, just getting a job isnt necessarily the answer, and especially not with how shit the country is going atm.
istq1s,g5b6agr,,Often I have trouble getting employers to give me a chance when I have no address.  Half the battle is getting someone to give you a chance.  Give life your best.  Do right and people will notice.  I spoke with a manager today that is willing to give me a chance.
istq1s,g5bgz5a,,I know what you mean. I have Williams Syndrome so I am very limited mentally and physically in what I can do and for how long. I am trying to figure out the whole getting disability thing but I so far i dont have the intellectual abilities to figure this out.
istq1s,,g5bhhag,A friend of mine went through that. I'm no expert but I could share what I know if it helps.
istq1s,,g5bhx21,Sure!
istq1s,,g5bim3t,Well have you seen the doctors yet?
istq1s,,g5bjanu,Yes but my medicaid plan changed and they assigned me to a new dr i havent been to yet. The williams syndrome association gave me links to the DDD papers to print, and i did. They also said i need a note from my dr to include with it but i am not sure what theyre supposed to put in the note. I made a list of how my ws effects my daily living and its like 100s of bullet points long.
istq1s,,g5bjkmk,I'm not sure what that note needs to be but maybe about your restrictions. Sounds like you need more communication from the doctor and medicaid.
istq1s,,g5bjr85,Yep
istq1s,g5ck1o0,,I have a job that pays shit ($9.95/hr) and will likely be homeless next month because it's almost impossible that I will have enough saved by then for first months rent and a deposit, even for just a room in a house somewhere. Either going to be in a shelter or a tent while I save up enough and pray I can find something.
istq1s,g5bawea,,This made me so mad.  I ended up homeless because my son's mental health deteriorated so bad that I had to leave my job to take care of him full time.  I tried every resource that I could find to get help, but inevitably after taking my son for a few days, I would get informed that my son was too much of a liability risk and they could no longer take him while I worked.  I went from a promising career in finance to homeless in a year and a half.  It's only been by luck, a few friends in the right place and some slightly fudged, but technically correct forms that I was able to get some assistance with getting a place after far too long living at the shelter.  Luckily we got out right before covid-19 hit the shelter pretty bad
istq1s,g5b689o,,You need 2 forms of ID or you‚Äôre screwed. Having those saved me maybe months at the beginning. And then I agree with just about everything else there. I actually graduated from a construction job where I could be dirty to an office job while living in a tent in the woods in the middle of austin and got out soon after.
istq1s,,g5b6cw6,I have my ID that's it.
istq1s,,g5jb72z,You won‚Äôt be able to fill out an I-9 get a job without 2 forms.
istq1s,,g5jcsr9,My last job was fine with my ID and social
istq1s,,g6f50zd,Oh cool!! Do you mean just you SS #? Or the actual card? I had to have the actual card or a certified birth certificate or a valid drivers license
istq1s,g5bar9k,,In a lot of major cities there are training and placement programs for the homeless. Not even bad jobs. I had a friend go through chef school. Loved it. Most of the time it also gets you bumped up the housing list. Edit: idk where you are but it might be worth considering migrating ;)  Don't give up. You could be the most depressed lonely frustrated person on the planet right now and all you have to do is persevere. I know it sounds stupid but trust me. DM me if you want some insights from a professional bum or just to talk. Or not.
istq1s,g63obuw,,**I was homeless and making $64,000 a year (after taxes) working 6 days a week.**  Having a job or income does not fix homelessness. To qualify to rent you need: good credit, stable rental history, current drivers license, some savings for deposits, no arrests, and maybe a co-signer.  I could have easily afforded any apartment... but have bad credit, no family to cosign, spotty rental history, expired drivers license, etc etc.
istq1s,g5bd1jy,,IMO, if getting a job is too hard for you, look for something else that will support you.  Jobcorps, or the army, for example.
istq1s,g5bqvi4,,Your mom doesn't pay enough.
istq1s,,g5btqfs,Why are you making fun of my mom.?
istq1s,,g5mg4uv,That's my typical reply when someone says get a job.
istq1s,,g5mpsq9,But I didn't say that someone else said it to me.
irt32d,g54dbip,,How is the view?  I never understood why cardboard was so invaluable to the homeless...until I became homeless.  I am old and my bones hurt on the cement.  A few layers of cardboard always makes a huge difference!!! Thanks for sharing.  Looks cozy!  Best to you!

irt32d,g56e9dz,,I made my own sleeping boxes out Corrugated Plastic Cardboard salvaged from convenience store that use it for signage and usually replace it every month or so. Often they receive signage from corporate and just toss it in the dumpster brand new. The stuff is even tough enough to build full size tents tall enough to stand up in or even bicycle trailers. It's light enough you can even make a [camper trailer you can pull around on a bicycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVLHKXk1Y7o). If you keep an eye on dumpsters you can do it for free. I just used 2.5 inch wide rolls of scotch tape from Walmart to tape it together because that makes near perfect connections that look factory, but 3M duct tape is amazing stuff.   One of the advantages is that done well you can put a discreet sleeping box right out in public and people will just assume it's a package belonging a business and leave it alone. It's also waterproof so you can make closets for your cloths, containers for food items that need to remain dry, etc. It also makes for a much dryer surface to sleep on in inclement weather.
isbtu6,g575fkh,,slab city
isbtu6,,g57gvfo,Pretty much this. I'm unaware of anywhere else in the usa a large group can gather without getting chased off by land owners or the police. Unless you're willing to like, hike deep into the wilderness and live off the land.
isbtu6,g57gziy,,I heard the west coast recently had 4 million acres of land open up.
isbtu6,,g57itbs,How so?
isbtu6,,g57on7x,Plague of fire. But still, that land is owned by people, soon to be owned by banks, who will in turn give it over to property developers. And since there are not enough renters/leasees/buyers to keep that cycle going, they'll likely fill it with private prisons.   However, the west coast is allowing more and more mandated homeless camps and tenant run vehicle dwelling lots.
isbtu6,g57xyh5,,LA and California in general is popular among the homeless
isbtu6,g58ttbn,,Anywhere west coast is homeless friendly
isbtu6,,g5f80ji,What ? I mean you can get free food but it's not all friendly on the west coast Washington isnwere I get most of my run in with the cops for hitchhiking. Oregon is not any better. Not saying you can have a good time but it's not really that friendly .

ipwqai,g4mlt8t,,Certainly in some of these Pacific Northwest cities that rain over half the year, something to keep the stuff out of the rain is probably a good idea.
ipwqai,,g4mnip3,It is and it's hard to argue with a stroller because if they do they have to bar Moms. Shopping carts die a lot and I always had people trying to bar me. Not with stroller...  People ask me all the time how I survived street life in NYC, thinking like this was how. Very important to minimize, hide and think outside the box as much as possible when homeless, particularly in a big city...
ipwqai,,g4mrpkg,Yeah yeah great story love the cat in the library. Agree you gotta go outside the box and do something a like diff as that's the most sure way to keep on.     camoflaged as a normal part of the cityscape environment is my thing.       My next rig will be a covert camper  Sprinter van with something like, "Bob's Plumbing Service" painted on the side panels.
ipwqai,g4oicyn,,Great advice! Take my gold!!
ipwqai,g4rhvof,,It used to crack me up when people used to look under the stroller cover for a baby and got that it was a cat. They have animal strollers. When I am finally in housing I'm going to get her one just so I can roll her around town. She likes it being adventure kitty... üò∏
ipwqai,g4oer3o,,Wow!   Great lifehack!
ipwqai,g4nqacq,,I commend you on your survival skills facing homelessness. I personally speak from personal experience as I was homeless on the downtown streets of Toronto between the ages of 13-18yrs old. I am lucky to say I survived. Please don‚Äôt let the streets define who you are and your self worth. People‚Äôs ignorance to homelessness is there own issue as for there lack of understanding and compassion  is there fault  no one asks to be put in that situation. I am uncertain if you reached out into your local community for supports to help you get back in the right track. If you don‚Äôt get answers keep pushing this is YOUR life we are talking about.  You matter as you are a human. !
ipwqai,g4n702w,,Love this comment.  Thanks.
ipwqai,g4pu7qc,,Awesome idea man, very inventive my friend. I was homeless in Chattanooga for a while, which is a college town. So it was fairly easy to blend in, I just kept my big stuff hidden, and walked around making sure I had nice clothes on, and a nice backpack! Lots of resources there, plenty of food, a free health department, and a thrift store where you can get a whole free outfit once a week! Plus lots of churches that would have cookouts and giveaways for the homeless..Not a bad place to be if you have to be homeless..

io50q7,,g4fis1x,It's not even about lack of sleep. It is about stress unwinding.
io50q7,,g4fszx2,I totally understand. I spent the last 2.5 years living and sleeping in my 5x5 storage unit. The stress, the trauma, and lack of normalcy, all of this needs to be decompressed from your body, mind, and spirit.   Enjoy and get as much rest as you need and want. :)

io50q7,,g4cwva8,Fuck Musk. Or any rich people.   Those who have to fight it are the best people.
io50q7,g4clc7d,,Congrats. At least you have furniture coming. When I first moved into my place it was completely empty for two weeks because I couldn't afford anything.

im1b9e,,g47gdig,cal anderson park is always the best place to park at night ! the 11th street side in front of the churches! that‚Äôs where i be

im1b9e,g3wnwb5,,When you are ready: https://www.seattlena.org/
im1b9e,,g3xrvnk,not to be a bitch but that is the most useless thing you could‚Äôve done, like you should have said nothing instead.

im1b9e,,g3xtjyc,It takes work and clearly you‚Äôre not ready to make that effort. They‚Äôre just reminding you of the resource when you are. Stay safe.
im1b9e,,g3xvvqa,NA alone will not keep you clean. you have to do a rehab program successfully.  and then NA can be crucial for some afterwords so you can  find new people who are sober and get a sponsor that helps. But always it‚Äôs very very different for EVERYONE because people use for different reasons. IDK WHY the hell you‚Äôre saying these things like I already don‚Äôt know that like I‚Äôm literally living the addiction right now you have no idea what I have gone through what I‚Äôm doing for myself currently to get clean but I have tried in the past etc. so stop acting ensuring to help because you literally just put a link to a very well-known organization that even mostly all sober he will know soooo üòêüòê

il725c,g3t30ug,,Panera, Starbucks, Le Bon Pan, places like that the managers can be really nice if you tell them you are homeless, dont stink and don't bother the customers panhandling. Not so much now because they are struggling with Covid slump in sales, but before Covid the managers at some of these places would tell you which bags had the food they were forced to toss every day. A lot of it still good and still in sealed plastic. I ate better on the street than I do in shelter.
il725c,,g6b6r9x,Also alot of places throw out pasteries so if you walk in like 5 minutes before closing you would probably get them
il725c,,g3tdhau,So if your like I'm homeless cool have a full time job and am extremely sexy Panera and afluent places will be nice. I never had such hope in a what a time to be alive lol

ik773y,g3iv71n,,I mean, not to be rude but a search on r/Homeless would of shown this topic been beaten like a dead horse.      All things mentioned are fine, I would suggest keeping it pre-sorted in the trunk of your car so you can ask them what they need so you're not giving the stuff away wastefully. What i mean by wasteful is if you give it pre-packed, some will throw most of it away and what they can recycle they will. Its all about traveling as light as one can so less is better.     If you want to give food, consider plastic food. By plastic food i mean fast food gift cards. Not Walmart or anything that can be cashed out unless you don''t mind the idea that they might cash it out or sell it for drugs/booze. I would say 9/10 would use it for the intended reasons.     Walmart sells $5 portable Power banks (in store, [Online they're like 6.88](https://www.walmart.com/ip/onn-Portable-Battery-1x-Charge-3350-mAh-Black/798926339?selected=true)). If you can get a bunch of those and charge them all up and give like two away at a time, that be awesome. With libraries closed  and cafe's being take out only, its harder to find places to charge.     Bus Tokens/Day Passes, etc for the Bus is helpful. You can usually buy a Day Pass directly from the bus driver on any route so if they say they need bus fare, you can 100% sure it will go to bus fare by getting them a day pass right on the spot, just wait for the next bus.     [Backpacks are key. This one fairly cheap, it has space and waterproof cover. This will probly go further than any tshirt or blanket or socks.](https://www.amazon.com/GZ-XINXING-Military-Backpacks-Rucksacks/dp/B07ZJ3C3JD/ref=sr_1_36?dchild=1&keywords=tactical%2Bbackpack&qid=1597610544&sr=8-36&th=1)A lot need a huge back to carry all the free stuff they can get from everywhere else.      General knowledge to know is know your area you plan to help in. Not this print out bs because honestly, i seen a lot of them toss away the print out paperwork. Save some trees. Know what and where your nearest nonprofit is for housing/rehab/mental health/food (hot plates, not banks)/Nearest homeless outreach or have the local outreach phone number on hand or know how to give the directions to get there. Like what buses they would need to take, etc.     Give them the nearest place to apply for County/State/Government Assistance. For us its Called Department of Social Services, Some places call it Health and Human Services. So you will have to google what its called for your area. This way they can get that assistance. Some legit don't know that is a resource they can get.      Offer them laundry. have them meet you at the laundry mat. Pay to wash their cloths. Gotta have clean cloths to be able to try to hit up temp job agencies. Not gonna let dirty looking people in. Offer body wash wipes. They're usually called fully body wipes. Dry Shampoo can be found pretty cheap too.
ik773y,,g3iyvma,hear, hear, or I should say right here here
ik773y,g3iurqp,,If there is public transit in your area I would suggest a few bus tickets in each care package. Cigarettes and candy.
ik773y,g3kuq9a,,Bug spray...bug spray ..bug spray!  This is always useful and needed and often left off the recommended list! Thanks for caring!
ik773y,g3nx75n,,Basic things that remind you that you are a human being help immensely such as new socks, movie theatre tickets, $10 Planet Fitness membership (to use showers anytime), or other low cost recreation options. Happiness and enjoyment is the last thing you can afford when you are homeless, but feeling like a person again for a moment goes a long way.
ijnpky,g3f03tv,,I've found that just going to day labor really helps. They open real early sometimes have free coffee and also a restroom...might have TV you can watch the morning news...charge your phone... can get out and work all day and get paid at the end of the day.  This is if you are physically capable of doing construction work. It's usually construction clean up but have worked all different types of things...even an NFL game!
ijnpky,,g3h7t8o,Yes I cleaned Tmobile arena Las Vegas thru a temp job. Wasn't homeless tho. Moving outside in oklahoma where its supposed to be country easy but its literally the saddest place on earth. High rent and cheap buildings filled with smoke  bugs and a 7 dollar min wage and the peopl are as insane as the weather changes daily
ijnpky,g3fk888,,10. Know the food banks.      Avoid other people.
ijnpky,,g3fkg0x,ah yessss food banks are a godsend. also in some counties you can get expedited food stamps when you're homeless. i got approved my 3rd day out on the street and received my card the following week.
ijnpky,,g3h8ym5,All the food banks I know won't give anything to homeless folks because they don't have "proof of residence".
ijnpky,,g3m8ncu,Yeah I've seen that but I've also seen a few "no turn away" food banks that give food to anyone who ask.
ijnpky,g3fialt,,I don‚Äôt see how #1 works. How do you get help from services at night? Where I‚Äôm at they‚Äôre only open during the day.
ijnpky,,g3fifz0,It's just my own general rule. if I have an appt at 8am or 11am I go to it but I'm going to bed after. It's really just whatever works for you
ijnpky,,g3hnttw,something like this doesn't work in cities like denver or salt lake where evening temps are around 0-18 degrees every single night from december to april...gotta get a sleeping bag and sleep at night to beat the temps...
ijnpky,,g3hnyhh,that's why I mentioned that this won't work for everyone. this is just stuff I learned that helped me
ijnpky,,g3ho356,Also I mentioned sleeping during the day when the sun is out

ijnpky,,g3hjp2q,i applied through 211 they also helped me get emergency food stamps

ijnpky,,g3fg2vz,You‚Äôre a good person.
ijnpky,g3h8mrx,,* Have a schtick--a project or habit or routine--something to do every day and in the long term, preferably unrelated to your living situation. Maybe it's volunteer work (even self-initiated), maybe a hobby or an interest of some kind. It's best to be something portable (you can easily take it with you everywhere), independent (you don't need other people to do it), and cheap, if not completely free (no special gear or operating costs).
ijnpky,,g3kabt7,this, there was a place you could volunteer at with other homeless and get first dibs on things.  joining AA or NA helps too
ijnpky,,g3mnwal,Not an alcoholic. Not an addict. Not safe (for me) to volunteer.
ijnpky,,g5br3gh,Why isn't it safe for you to volunteer?
ijnpky,,g3h9d17,thissssss is very important! thank you
ijnpky,g3hhwok,,Ignore 8 if you're in the south, mosquitos.
ijnpky,,g3hi9rc,mosquitos are everywhere mannnn the bites don't even bother me anymore. green alcohol soothes the bites a bit
ijnpky,,g3ielv2,In Austin Texas our mosquitoes have West Nile virus. The symptoms are similar to covid.
ij1r1c,g47fjxs,,Hypocrisy and double standards based on your net worth is nothing new. White affluent college kids smoking weed and drinking are just boys having fun. Poor black kids doing the same would be thugs . I mean in America homelessness is more or less made a crime due to property laws. The respect for human lives that don‚Äôt have money is basically nothing.
ij1r1c,g3blxa0,,And people really are hitting the liquor hard, too. It's annoying because we haven't changed our beer consumption in this house during covid. But, everyone else has upped their drinking, and it's wiped off the shelves when we try to buy. Except for the awful stuff, and we're not that desperate. Just want some Twisted Teas.   Almost everyone uses some kind of drugs, sugar, gaming, or such to cope. For any reasons. Not just homelessness and covid, but all of life's stressors. The rare people that are vegan, caffeine free, fat free, sugar free, drug/alcohol/prescription free, etc. seem to cope with an addiction to telling everyone about what they don't do, recruiting people, informing people about the benefits of their lifestyle, and arguing with those that don't immediately agree.   All I can say is, thanks Nancy Reagan for taking a huge social and health crisis that's exploited by international crime, and making the cure more prejudice, ignorance, knee jerk reactions, and generalizations. Her ignorant prejudicial viewpoint about all things drug related crippled our abilities as a group to look at drugs critically. "Drugs er bad, mmmmkay?"
ij1r1c,g3b9cfh,,As someone who was homeless for years in SF I highly discouraged my friends from using drugs as it‚Äôs a great way to stay homeless. Drinking, great (unless you‚Äôre an addict). Dope, nope!  But yeah fuck those bored housewives and their two buck Chuck

iiusph,g3fq522,,Nope. Craigslist might be your best bet for that. But I would go on one of those Alaskan fishing boats. Free or cheap as hell room and board, and you get paid pretty well. Granted, it's hard work, but it would pay off.

Ended up shelling out rent for a dangerous place filled with smoke and bugs then forced to moved back home with toxic family coming back from amazing las vegas. Just found a spot in the OKC woods tho wouldnt have dreamed of a tent 2019üëå
ii8fy5,g3757eh,,Congrats too, but I just feel twisted inside that the very system that keeps us in poverty is the same one that we need to survive...I wish it would just all fall apart and we can start over OR have progressives in charge of things like Bernie and AOC, real people with hearts and souls.

ii8fy5,g37zv77,,Please don't call it a shitty cleaning job.
ii8fy5,,g39c1y1,Well I call it that cause it's minimum wage in a kinda dangerous area. But at least it's income and my coworkers seem ok so far.
iikhui,g37bsrp,,Trust me brother it might get tedious or bothersome but brushing your teeth is definitely worth it. Saves a lot of trouble later on.
iikhui,,g37qpo9,Ahhh‚Äîyes, unfortunately this is true. There‚Äôs that saying: ‚Äúonly the rich can afford to neglect their teeth.‚Äù  Even with insurance dental costs are insane (in the US), I really hate our healthcare.
iikhui,,g38gue3,Because of a wisdom tooth removal and one other tooth I had 6 dentist and dental hygienist appointments within a month and still need to go to the capital to get an expensive picture taken and later one more tooth removed and I'm looking for bills at around 200 euros. I'm a mentally challenged broke college student so it's a significant chunk or my income but worth it would be more expensive in the US yea? I live in Northern Europe where in the country which doesn't have free health care.
iikhui,,g38n752,That work would cost thousands here (Silicon Valley).  Last rotten tooth I had removed cost me three hundred plus pain meds. That was cheap, he wanted almost five hundred, yet discounted me because I was 'homeless'.  O_N_E  Extraction .  The under qualified MediCal dentist I was referred to couldn't perform the extraction, finally gave up.  They Couldn't even write a prescription, it was refused at the Pharmacy. The next day I had it done out of pocket, cost me every penny I had at the time.  Fuck Healthcare, Fuck the warmonger gubment, Mega InsuranceCo, and the wannabepractioners that bleed off the system.
iikhui,,g3brfvu,Mmmmmmmmm .... pain meds.......mmmm?m
iikhui,,g3clvoz,You should try going overnight after a failed extraction w/o em.
iikhui,,g39lyg8,Yup! I had a broken tooth that needed a crown and even with insurance it was going to cost at least $2k.  When I had Medi-Cal when I was without a job, I called to see what was covered under my dental and they told me that only certain things were covered and crowns weren‚Äôt one of them. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   I know it‚Äôs hard to think about these things when the world is falling down around you though. Even I found it hard to do basic things during my deepest depression phase but after experiencing the pain and stress from before, I now will get out of bed to do at least that one thing.
iikhui,,g3aahdf, What ever happened to that broken tooth? They used to keep mine until one day I asked for one and they said, no, its going to research. Iow, they even make money selling your body parts.  Hey thats my money, fool. I need that money not you, dammit!  Little things your local witch doctor never told you.
iikhui,,g3dz4m0,I didn‚Äôt know they did that with your extracted teeth!  I eventually got a crown put on it but that whole process was a nightmare. So many screwups with the molding by the dentist. Was an extremely painful experience financially, physically, and mentally.  So now I just make sure I floss and brush even if that‚Äôs all I can do during any bouts of depression. Never again!  I wish I could move elsewhere with a better healthcare system.
iikhui,,g3emb6w,> I didn‚Äôt know they did that with your extracted teeth!  Yah, they train dentists on them, use them in labs for experimentation with medications, cleaning products, DNA, whatever.  I never opted for crowns, couldn't afford them, they aren't covered under Healthcare here.  All thats covered is life saving interventions, (i.e., extractions) for infected teeth. That stuff can kill you, so they do the minimum helpful thing-- pull it.  Better than dying from infection from tooth ache. At least they use novocaine, unlike a hundred years ago.
iikhui,,g395d4n,Can concur. Finally got insurance I can afford to use but couldn't (because covid, getting appointments were difficult). Even with insurance, root canal's going to cost me almost $1k.
iikhui,,g392aop,This is so so true. I am suffering the consequences of being essentially homeless (but periodically housed via friends and motels) for 4 months. Even when I could finagle a roof over my head - my money went to food instead of basic hygiene products.   Now I am looking at thousands of dollars in dental work.
iikhui,g385c6z,,Salvation army here they give out toothbrushes and toothpaste. There are a lot of places that do. Definitely do NOT neglect dental health. I haven't taken a shower for a long time but I brush my teeth twice a day.
iikhui,,g38xfdz,If you go to any dentist office and sweet talk the receptionist, she can likely set you up with a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and mouthwash. Floss is a multi use item, I use it to sew. Floss every day.
iikhui,g37fvv8,,It's the little things, right?  So much taken for granted, but so much appreciated.  Here's hoping you won't have to wait that long the next time.
iikhui,g38poba,,I look like I have aged 20 years in the last 6 months.
iikhui,g38y8kd,,Ask for razors, shave cream and soap at soup kitchens. Dollar Tree sells a pack of 10 razors for $1. They also have a mirror that looks like a compact. It has a mirror on one side and a collapsible hair brush on the other side. Great for tick checks.
iikhui,g395uqh,,What's your financial situation like?    I used to get free haircuts at the barber's college because it grew so fast and I didn't mind the slower cuts. I also got free cuts at work from coworkers because they also didn't like paying for cuts.   As for brushing your teeth, it'd just do it as I walked around. Spit into the gutter.
iikhui,g39l4w0,,Yup. Treating yourself good, makes you feel good- alive. Looking good isn‚Äôt just to impress people, it has a physical and psychological affect on the body too.
iikhui,g380bi9,,How the hell did you manage not to brush your teeth for 2 weeks? Toothbrushes are like..a dollar a pack
iikhui,,g3bv7ox,Not everything is about money. Depression, PTSD and other illnesses often interfere with a persons ability to properly care for themselves.
iikhui,,g3nsyv4,True
iiix28,g3acgjr,,No, its not always about money. There are some homeless, who, if you gave them a full checkbook and a furnished apartment, they wouldn't know what to do with it. They wouldn't understand the concept of paying their bills. They wouldn't understand the concept of cleaning up, either after themselves, or their own bodies. Who's gonna babysit them and show them how to live in civilization again? Who's gonna babysit them and make sure they take their meds? Who's gonna keep them from blowing their money on drugs? Hell, who's gonna keep them from just wandering off back to the life their comfortable with, the life they know??  Its not a money thing. Its a human thing. You can't make someone live inside, not without imprisoning them. Some people, a sizable percentage of the homeless, are more comfortable at surviving outside rather than living inside.
iiix28,g37oczb,,If you were a billionaire you could give permanent homes to every homeless person. Why would you open this instead?
iiix28,g39ater,,Donald Sterling is a racist landlord who has been sued for Fair Housing violations where he explicitly didn't rent units to Black people. He's one of the reasons homelessness is so prevalent in the Black community. Also the fact that he never built it means it was just PR.
iiix28,g37rs7h,,Housing homeless has nothing to do with money. Homelessness is a problem within the human condition. Unfortunate people should be helped whenever possible. But its impossible to eradicate homelessness.
iiix28,,g38ebx5,I disagree. Housing homeless has everything to do with money. No one will put up the $$$hard cold cash to create millions of new homes for all these homeless people living in cars and tents. The worst is that there are children and infants living out of tents. America can do a hell of a lot better than allowing a child to grow up in such pitiful and pathetic conditions...
ihsml5,g32k6v1,,America is facing a mass eviction crisis now that extra unemployment and eviction moratoriums are being lifted.  If someone doesn't think this will have political/economic consequences,  their head is so far up their ass that there's no point speaking to them.
ihsml5,g33bme9,,I think now that a pretty huge chunk of America is faced with the very real and very immediate prospect of destitution and homelessness, with a government that seems to have little intention of actually doing anything effective about it, people are waking up to the fact that it could be any one of us. It's always been that way, of course, but most people were blissfully ignorant of the reality of how precarious their situation actually is, distracted by bread and circuses.
ihsml5,g32dwq8,,::eyeroll::  This kind of nonsense tends to arise from people whose entire life has been paid for by the efforts of others.  Human life is *dependent* on property. We are a tool-using species. If you don't believe me, go walk naked into the wilderness and try to survive. You'll find out very rapidly how little human life is worth in the absence of property.  And here's the thing: most of the homeless people I know understand this at a gut level because they have so little. If you're Bill Gates and your car gets stolen, you call the insurance company. If you're homeless and the same thing happens? You've got a serious problem you need to address immediately.  I knew a guy who got much of his nutrition from fishing. What do you think would have happened if someone had stolen his fishing gear? Do you think he would have been sympathetic to your fanciful notion that this tool vital for his survival wasn't worth anything?  We can certainly do better with regards to homelessness. But people like you are part of the problem, not part of the solution.
ihsml5,,g32e8d7,Are you really trying to debate on the premises that property is more valuable than human life?
ihsml5,,g32ebsn,I'm pointing out that property is *essential* to human life. You can't separate the two.
ihsml5,,g32frjg,Yes of course. And homeless persons have no property and are stuck in a system that reinforces their scarcity/poverty. So what exactly do you disagree with?
ihsml5,,g32pj9z,I'm disagreeing with the notion that your nonsensical ideology has anything to do with homelessness or helping homeless people.
ihsml5,,g32qdb0,I have no idea what you are even talking about. Maybe you can go to r/neoliberal or something where you don't have to worry about shouting at people to get off your lawn, and where other middle aged privileged white folks espouse their archaic libertarian views freely.
ihsml5,,g32qzqe,I'd suggest that you stop posting nonsense on a homeless sub-reddit when you clearly know nothing about homelessness, homeless people or how they can be helped.
ihsml5,,g32wywu,Why are you being downvoted? Property IS essential...?
ihsml5,,g32yf6z,Where has anybody made any claim to the contrary?
ihsml5,,g32yo30,Nowhere! I‚Äôm just agreeing that property is essential, and as someone who was homeless not too long ago, within the year actually, I can agree that personal items and property is definitely something we as humans need.
ihsml5,,g33otfk,They‚Äôre being downvoted because they chose to ignore that the post says the property of the richest man on earth and not a tool essential for survival.
ihsml5,,g32xlas,There are a cadre of people who think a homeless sub-reddit is a great place to proselytize their ideology rather than actually try to help homeless people.  You'll notice these folks never bother to actually *help* anyone with tips, advice or sources to seek out. They just make grandiose statements that don't do anyone any good.
ihsml5,,g33bsj6,Personal property and private property are not the same thing.      I think it's quite fair to assume that the original post is talking about the latter, not the former.
ihsml5,,g33f7hj,The amount of respect you deserve is determined by your ability to understand the plight of others. I‚Äôm a homeowner, and I have sympathy.  Without sympathy, you are far more miserable than anyone you‚Äôre trying to deprive of basic human rights. Everyone deserves respect, shelter, and food- even you.
ihsml5,,g33oq1u,So did you choose to just disregard the ‚Äúproperty OF THE RICHEST MAN ON EARTH‚Äù because it didn‚Äôt suit your agenda of derailing the conversation here or did you not catch it? Clearly tools and personal property are essential to survival. A couple of $50 million dollar homes, though? Not essential even a little. Stop being obtuse.
ihsml5,,g33tt1q,What 'conversation'? The OP was standing up on a soapbox in a completely inappropriate fashion for the board:  Rule #3: > Posts must be directly related to homelessness.

ihxo38,g33iodc,,OMG.  That's the best feeling in the world.  The BEST.  THE BEST.  Congrats.  I got a (temporary) home in May.   Tomorrow I go for the third time to volunteer to build homes for other people.  It's a good circle to be a part of.

ihci1t,g3432la,,My brother was homeless in NYC for 2 years. Everything he had of value, was stolen while he slept. A man he became good friends with ended up taking his own life from despair. And my brother ended up dying from a stroke last year while still waiting for his disability and permanent housing to come through.   We grew up in NYC, so if anyone should have made it through, I was sure he would. I‚Äôm not trying to be a downer or be mean. Best advice; don‚Äôt be homeless in NYC.
if6der,g2lrdni,,Check whether there's a vehicle dwelling social media page for your locale. If there isn't one already, start one. Post up links to relevant video clips, information about safer parking spots, quality businesses that treat you right (e.g. for tires, glass, general repairs).
if6der,,g2m1ulp,I will definitely have to check this out because I really want to find a new place to park at night or in general honestly. Do you know of any places I can look at to find people who might have did the same thing in my area?
if6der,,g2my8lp,You'll have to do this yourself because I haven't a clue where you are. Look here (at Reddit) for a sub-reddit for your city. Check FB, too. Use search terms like vehicle, car, urban, camping, van, etc.

if6der,g2m20gn,,My car was my ticket to freedom too. I was scared but it felt great like you described. I did it for over a year.  Pro: Freedom to drive away from danger Place to lock my stuff  Means to get and keep job  You stay cleaner, cooler/warmer than street homeless  You don't look homeless to strangers  Your shoes don't wear out   Con: Gas money and maintenance Nosy judgmental cops  Homeless ppl asking for rides all the time  Tickets or being told to move from my spots  Break ins and vandalism  Traveling for food more often even with ice chest
if6der,,g2mk7z6,The maintenance is a huge con I have to take my car to the shop soon and if I have to leave it there I‚Äôm worried I will not have a place to sleep for a couple of days
if6der,,g2ona90,Depending on what‚Äôs wrong, you can schedule it ahead of time and they should be able to get it done the same day. Schedule an appointment just to look at it, in case they need to order parts, then another for the actual repairs. Just tell them you need the car for work and can‚Äôt leave it for more than an afternoon.

Please don‚Äôt stop there and continue your road of recovery, expect bumps along the way and that is expected as that only means soon you will see a light at the end of your hardship. I also encourage you to reach out for supports and please don‚Äôt do this on your own..look on line or in your community. Abusive  situations unfortunately will never change unless the abuser themselves recognize they have a problem. Statistic prove unfortunate most don‚Äôt Focus on only you! My advice comes to you from personal experience as I was homeless for 7 years living in the streets of downtown Toronto ( ages 13-17 years old)...due to violence with in my home. I am one of the lucky ones that was able to survive . I am a single mother to 6 grown children that are living healthy productive lives and all did there schooling...and I also am a proud grandmother to a beautiful 1 and half year old grand daughter. Yes survival is possible but it‚Äôs extremely hard and I wish more awareness would be brought situations like this ...as any type of violence can become a vicious cycle...as I didn‚Äôt have a childhood but I made the difference  and gave one to mine....believe in yourself and never give up...

I'm really happy that you have a car! I don't but I have been finding places to sleep when there are no beds available at the homeless shelter. It's definitely scary being a single young woman while homeless.  Getting away from the abuse was very brave of you. I know the feeling of freedom that comes with leaving. Now you only have yourself to worry about and you can work on creating the life you dream of. Your positive attitude will serve you well during this difficult time. I wish you the best, and if you ever need or want someone to chat with, you can message me! Good luck and God Bless!

Have been for a few years now. Be aware of people you see watching you, it‚Äôs good you noticed that guy! Public schools and churches are also good spots. It would be safer if you had a dog my little 20 pound rat terrier goes NUTS! If someone aproaches the truck.

I was in no way disparaging of you or your comment in my reply. Simply tried to retell a story and maybe a true Karen would switch her mood and help out, and also, you stick lameface. Have a good one, stay safe
ienefr,,g2k7w6m,Don't knock it. I used my old white lady privilege to tell a transit cop, 'these are not the droids you are looking for'. I thought that npr podcast degree would pay off.  Got to use the resources available, and at this juncture in life, it's not for free drinks
ienefr,,g7u7zzh,Go trumpfuck virus!
ienefr,g2ic15t,,the only upside is the panhandle potential. I know of a few who are in wheelchairs, sitting outside starbucks make a easy $100+USD a day . Sure the cops sometimes come out but its just the "hey move along" and nothing else comes of it then he leaves for a bit, comes back and at it again.
ienefr,g2jpw9t,,I'm sorry my friend. I was discharged after a nice beat down, coma beat down, at 1:30 in the morning in the same territory I was beat in, literally put out the doors, after coma. I was in complete shock. But, I looked to my left, trying to focus my eyes, and in a wheelchair was a homeless friend who had been shot in his calves, open oozing wounds, drains, in shock like me, but I could have at least made an attempt to fight or run. He was in that chair. He couldn't even stand to piss.   I was reminded again, it can get worse. Much worse

ienefr,g2imaxt,,How fucked up is that? What about joining each other and forming some sort of lobby group to protest a fucked up system in which this is even possible? I mean, it seems like you're becoming quite more and more people in your or a similarly difficult situation these days. I'm not homeless but I'd happily support you if I lived in the US.
ienefr,,g2k8xv3,The catch, those who have the resources to make a difference will never find themselves in such a position. They are generally bailed out from bottle to IV, never a thought to it.  Any kind of support might help. Heck just for cast scratches. Hope the best for you my friend.
ienefr,,g2kb2qq,Probably not, but the current situation, as I see it, mostly is that each of you homeless people is on their own, fighting solely for themselves or at max a small group of peers. The path to true attention and change is - as it has always been - joining and raising! For that, no money is needed, only courage and endurance and a reasonable amount of fellow campaigners.
ienefr,,g2kcg7v,Totally agree, and disagree. See you at the revolution
ienefr,g2iuyvm,,I'm hoping you can hook up with someone to help.   If it were me I would go back to the hospital that did my surgery and make a fuss. Once a hospital does a surgical procedure on you, they own it, demand to talk to the doctor who did it , the surgical resident on tbe ward would be your best bet. they have to put in social work folkow up, case manager etc.
ienefr,g2ih60q,,Get well soon brother. Thats really tough though, maybe a church can help you.

Hey if you have a phone, are out often and enjoy making things better, check out the Litterati app. You can take a picture of trash/brands you find, tag it with the location and it accumulates all data to try and pressure manufacturers to use less plastic, recycle stuff etc. In my country they made a certain candy brand switch to paper wrappers instead of plastic.

I was fortunate enough to have a Dunkin nearby that had no problem with me filling a bunch of Gatorade bottles from their bathroom sink. I have dry hair so I cam get away with washing it once a week. To do that, I dump out my bath water (on poison ivy, if it's around... soap kills it!) and use a fresh bowl for that. I have another bowl that I use to wash my dishes in. Wet it. Soap it. Rinse it.

i6918t,,g0ubm8b,I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I couldn't give a crap if you take the Bible and throw it out. I am not forcing you to read it. They were given to me free, so they take absolutely nothing from the funds I have available to purchase items with. Additionally, the last time I did this, three of the six people specifically asked for additional wooden crosses because they wanted them. So, I appreciate your opinion, but I will opt to ignore it.
i6918t,,g0v8gu3,I don‚Äôt care where you found kindness and love in your heart, as long as you do no harm. You are doing the work most turn their eyes from. Good job..- ya wing nut , üòè
i6918t,,g0x1u3m,Plastic spoons?  A lot of people give out food without utensils, and eating foods applesauce with fingers or licking from the container sucks.    Otherwise, this is a great thing you're doing and very well thought out.  Also, a pouch that can be carried is usually appreciated.
i6918t,,g0uawtv,Save the items and please just stop voting neoliberals into office.
i6918t,,g0ubn4e,Why not both?
i6918t,,g0ufhwl,Fair point.
i6918t,g0ubt4w,,It‚Äôs cool you care and you‚Äôre right, not going to change any lives but maybe restore a tiny bit of faith in humanity.  The dollar store is such a ripoff though. Your money will go a lot further food-wise at a warehouse type grocery store.
i6918t,,g0uccn9,You're right. If I can find things at Costco, it's cheaper per unit. However, all of this stuff here cost under $100. If I were to buy these things at Costco, while it would be less per unit, it would have cost $300 to buy this many different things. Not to mention that Costco doesn't pack things in Travel size or snack size for a lot of stuff. I have been informed that repackaging foods are frowned upon, so doing the best I can! :)

i6918t,g0ueptx,,Bro, ignore what they‚Äôre saying. You did a good thing for a country going to Hell. These people need what they can get and what you did can save someone people a lot and potentially save their life (could be going days or weeks without proper food or water or hygiene). Good job, man.
i6918t,g0v79vi,,Bags too?! That‚Äôs a haul. I want to hijack an ice cream truck and pass out frozen bottled water. Help keep things cool and then an ice cold water. It‚Äôs great getting a drink, but nice to have one that was rolln int the back of the church van for 3 hours. Just a thought. Every thing looks great, you obviously put a lot of thought and empathy in there too.

i6918t,g0v3sw6,,We have been helping a man living in his car. One thing he said about a donation someone recently gave to him was that he could not eat everything because he has dental issues. If you can you may want to see what people want versus just giving them a random assortment. That way it will all get used to it‚Äôs full potential.
i6918t,,g0v3zjc,I am. I have a six drawer cabinet type thing in my car and people get to point and choose what they want. They can't grab things, because if hygiene, but I ask them what they want. I don't have any top teeth, so believe me, I understand that! Thanks for the reminder!
i5uf2b,g0t9125,,And America has known this for years. We're just a heartless people.
i5uf2b,,g0tem9n,Most people DON'T know this, and require A LOT of convincing.  Even when you show them the emergency room bills that get paid for by charities, they don't connect that with any kind of cost to themselves.  Even if THEY, themselves, don't have access to regular medical care, they fail to see how a charity spending money to take care of the feet of someone who doesn't have a place to wash their socks in a sink and hang them dry to prevent jungle rot has an impact on the fact that that same charity doesn't have any money to contribute to THEIR medical care.  Medical costs are a HUGE part of how homeless people cost society MILLIONS per person on the street annually, but most people will, over and over, refuse to see the answer when you lay it all out for them.  You have to impact society - you have to change the culture to one of giving, or you have to spread the information as something that EVERYBODY KNOWS.  Until you reach cultural saturation, cultural change won't happen.
i5uf2b,,g0tfczt,Utah instituted a program of housing the homeless and it worked.  Then there was a new election and the money stopped because "tax cuts"  America is a failed State.
i5uf2b,,g0ti6en,Okay - I still have faith that we can vote in a better government, especially with the civil movement going on right now, so - A state isn't a failed state until another state replaces it.  And.  Utah's experiment has inspired countless programs around the world: IT IS NOT A FAILED EXPERIMENT, and it will win.  The only question is how long it will take AFTER we create a welfare state before we move on to the next evolution of equality.
i5uf2b,,g0to7pe,I no longer share your faith. There were Left Populist movements in the 1890s (look up Thomas Frank on YouTube; his book, "The People, No" is very much on topic. Paul Jay has a 3 part interview of him, very much work the listen), again in the 1930s under Roosevelt and here we are again, stuck in the same cycle. The rich keep getting smarter about preventing the American People from actually having any say in hoplw our government operates or even who is in it and they have functionally succeeded in walling off any influence other than their own. The judicial branch has cemented this paradigm which is why I no longer have faith in working through "legitimate channels", as they have all been effectively neutered.  We the People must go on strike against the oligarchs' flat refusal to allow socialised healthcare IN THE FACE OF A PANDEMIC. They're commiting a human rights atrocity in broad daylight and the American People are letting them do it. If we don't rise up now, we don't deserve freedom and we won't have any.

i5uf2b,,g0ufg8z,Sweetie pie, we've been singing that song to the 'liberal' in SF for decades.  There were no homeless before Mayorette Diane Feinswein created it here, in sync with Reagan.  SF liberal?  LOL.  Not if you judge by results.    Oh, sure, they will get their cred by backing up groups like the Degenderettes who advocate rape and murder to lesbians who dobn't want to have sex with a chick with a dick.    That's how woke they are.  Throw women under the bus.  Even though we have a high rate of domestic violence and a high rate of adults without children, there are NO domestic violence shelters here.  When I asked Willie Brown's 'homeless czar (both are black males, btw)' why this was so, he actually told me, "Women without children can always find a man to protect them"  Kamala "Whoreiss" Harris got her start in politics by fucking Willie Brown, btw.    She's all me too now, but she'll put on her sequin knee pads for any old pervert who will give her a political job  We're so woke we have an old cow vampire with bad hair as our eternal senatewhore, she is the only girl in the Bohemian Club and votes to the right of the GOP..

i5uf2b,g0t6ur9,,The study was done quite a while ago if I am thinking it's the same one I learned about in school. I checked the article and it was published back in 2014...  It's really sad because the calculations have literally been done and it's a win-win for everyone because people pay less and people who are homeless get places to live.
i5uf2b,,g0ufnn2,You are ASSuming that the poverty pimps want the homeless off the streets.  They want anything but that.
i5uf2b,g0ueis8,,Thats kind of a no duh thing.  Fact is, almost all of the 'homeless money' goes to pimps, grifters, and is spent on the elected and appointed officians on themselves.    If there were no homeless, no gravy train for them.  Think about it.

i5gwtw,,g0rfbv2,Wow. That's an intense story. You're living through something that most people can never imagine. It's scary, but it will be part of you forever and a very beautiful part. Yeah I shake at loud noises and I still eat like I don't know where my next meal is coming from and sunsets give me anxiety, but I'm grateful for the perspective I have. Closing a door, being able to sleep when I want. Privacy. That's something that nobody can appreciate until they don't have it.   I'm really sorry for you losing your friend. But it seems like she had a very rewarding life and spread a lot of love. I'm glad you got to get to know her.   For what it's worth, the last person I touched is dead now too. He wasn't dead at the time, but my roommate ended up dying a couple weeks later and I don't know when I will touch another person again. It's a dark little thought worm.

i5ssol,g0sbrvn,,Here's what they are NOT doing: opening the libraries, opening the community centers, putting homeless into hotels, providing alternatives to any of these things (for showers, internet, AC, power, etc.....)
i5ssol,g103p0i,,It wasn't the government exactly, but one of the coalition got some funding to put the most vulnerable homeless into hotel rooms to shelter-in-place back in the early spring. Funding was renewed a few times but ran out and so we're all back out on the street and it didn't actually cover all of the vulnerable people for example my boyfriend is elderly but was not told why he could not get a hotel room and we know people who lied about their age and health to get in hotel room set it up as a one-stop-shop for hookers and drugs dealing location and are continuing to pay the rent that way. Grumble.
i5ssol,g104bh8,,Also the health department got the local high school to let us use their swimming pool building with showers in locker room on a daily basis so for the first time in the city the homeless had access to daily showers a couple of months. When the regular homeless day Center open back up the high school decided their pool building was not needed for shower anymore so they stopped the program. Unfortunately they did not realize that the homeless day Center only allows you to shower once a week. they only have one shower stall to serve 300 people the hours are during meal time so you have to wait around and risk skipping a meal to make sure you get your shower. and they do not clean it  ...they asked the homeless to clean up after themselves which isn't reliable. I broke down and bought a Planet Fitness card.
i5ssol,,g105bdd,Because the last time I tried to use the shower at the day Center, previous person left it in such horrible shape, that I spent about twenty minutes cleaning the stall other fixtures etc. I finally took off my clothes and started the water and got a knock on the door saying my time was up and they wouldn't let me actually get cleaned up after cleaning up after everybody else
i5ssol,,g109x3i,Thank you for the info.  Out of curiosity, what city are you in?
i5ssol,,g10dg6c,I prefer to keep that detail private for reasons. It's a non major city in the Midwest.

i5ssol,g0rcjkz,,What State are you in?
i5ssol,,g0rczug,Washington (state, not D.C.).  To be clear, I'm not personally looking for help; as part of a school project, I'm investigating what COVID-related homeless programs are out there.  Unfortunately, my Google-fu isn't up to the task, so I figured I'd reach out here for help.
i4uum4,g0lw6ys,,How a society treats its poor is a competition between fear and hope   If the middle class hope of being rich outweighs the fear of being poor then the poor suffer. If fear rules the poor do better.   Sad but truth.

i4uum4,,g0pj303,An economy is not a fixed pie. One person becoming wealthier doesn't make others poorer. What you're saying (other than the parts about lobbying) is a perfect example of zero-sum thinking.
i4uum4,,g0rn4kn,Wealth inequality becomes a problem when the richest in society reach a position to start spending more for things they want than the poorest can spend on things they need.  So for housing, a wealthy persons desire to invest in airbnb outcompetes a poor persons need for a home.  This is a function of inequality, not absolute wealth. Most of the working homeless in the US could probably afford a nice house in Bulgaria. But they are competing with wealthy landlords.  Another way of looking at this, per person, the USA has twice the wealth of Italy.   However the median Italian is 50% richer than the median American.
i4uum4,,g0rzm08,So housing is affordable where there isn't tourism?
i4uum4,,g0mawvy,Really.
i324mt,g08ocil,,When I lived in my car I slept till noon for this exact reason. But its impossible if you don't park under a tree or some form of shade. And I live in Florida, that shit was brutal.
i324mt,,g08v2vs,I also live in Florida and even with a tree and sunshades it is basically impossible to sleep once the suns up.   And the migraines are devastating if I get one during the day. No way to block out the extreme amount of light getting in without also trapping all the heat in the process.
i324mt,,g095ol2,Sorry I should clarify I did more than just park in shade (though that still helps immensely).  * I slept with a USB mini fan plugged into a power bank (10,000 mAh which I charged every day at the Uni I graduated from and loiter in). ($10 and $20 respectively). A USB fan running off a 10k mAh bank can last 9-10 hours. * I rolled down the window where my pillow/head would be and put a black mesh over it so I could get some outdoor air ($10-15 bucks on Amazon) but also deter people from seeing an open window and getting into my car. * I placed UV shades on three windows of my car (front, back and side in the direction of sun rising). Cheapest I've seen is $7 a piece at Walmart. The only area I don't put the shade on is where my pillow/head and black mesh is. The way I park I always have the pillow/head side facing AWAY from where the sun rises since I don't have to worry about sunlight passing over my head. * I parked underneath a tree.  Without these yeah I'd say its impossible and also summer weather is a bitch no matter what. The goal is to prevent ANY light from getting in since ya know, greenhouse effect. Even in the dead of winter with 40 degree weather, sunlight wil burn the inside of your car. The fan is used to circulate air but its pointless if sunlight gets in since it will circulate hot air. Most nights I slept like a baby unless its anywhere from 70+ degrees Fahrenheit at night then its a bit tougher. Everything I mentioned are one time costs so if you can manage to buy into optimizing your car for comfortable sleeping, that's how I'd recommend going about this.
i324mt,,g0ajovr,Thanks for the detailed explanation!
i324mt,,g0aqzsj,Np, I slept in my car for 20ish months so I spent a lot of time, trial and error in optimizing my car for comfortable sleep. Feel free to comment further or msg me for more clarification.
i324mt,,g092qyi,Florida is awful with the migraines and trying to sleep during the day. I have black out curtains and it‚Äôs still unbearable most days. I feel ya on this one
i324mt,,g0au3xs,Maybe the first night sleep would pass easy cause the stress would just get to anyone. But the grind of it happening again and again means the opposite ofmrestful sleep probably
i324mt,,g09a6oq,Any day on the tracks in Silicon Valley heat was also brutal.  I had a thin camper shell in a steel truck bed. The side windows and back opened but the air is usually calmer here, even in mild weather the direct sun heated that box like an oven. One little DC fan, a gallon of water and me, baking in my shell.   ssssssss......
i324mt,,g095m5v,Even when i had a car i had to turn the ac on at that point
i324mt,g0bx994,,2 meals? I'm lucky if I eat once a day.

i2ku1d,g05fbf6,,Thank you. So true. "The experts doing homeless Outreach" where I am legit told me every single one of these things - especially the part about going to the police for help, applying for the 8 year HUD wait-list and 4 year SSD wait-list. And NOBODY in any agency will even give GIFT CARDS like specific to Shell or BP for a tank of gas. They say "all that had to stop because all homeless are addicts and they just sell the gift cards for drug cash." Um I have 3 degrees, refuse even MOST Rx drugs don't even do MJ so really not a drug addict. But I absolutely see how it happens. A sane educated person shows up doing EVERYTHING to regain stability again and NOTHING WORKS. Why wouldn't most people just slip into the oblivion of street drugs? Nobody cares about them "at the expert homeless agencies" so why should they care that they inevitability just give up. "A system cannot fail those it was never designed to protect." - Dubois
i2ku1d,,g05hndl,That's what we hear from people. Particularly here in Los Angeles a lot of people start doing meth to stay awake because they get robbed/raped/assaulted by housed people who get "tired of seeing them", cops, and other unhoused people at night. Then they do heroin to try to sleep during the day/numb the trauma of all the things they've lived through. It can happen to anyone.
i2ku1d,,g08qfdr,Also, being homeless is *unbelievably boring*. There's nowhere to go, nothing to do, it can make you go insane - or exacerbate any mental issues you might already have. It's like 10% trauma, 90% nothingness. Just... Quality time with your brain! No wonder people try to make their brains shut up.
i2ku1d,,g0ivacs,This. Books were my savior, I was lucky to live in an area that had tons of free books (library books are easily lost or damaged) and I saw so many other homeless reading, at much larger rates than the general populace.
i2ku1d,,geld90n,It can be soooo boring. This is something people don't get.
i2ku1d,,g069otr,I've watched it happen to many, many people. First they become homeless, then they turn to drugs or alcohol.
i2ku1d,,g0c5x5u,Hey I'm just a lurker, but a friend showed me images of skid row yesterday.. I don't know anything about the city.. but how far from there is a 'rural' area where someone can just go off into a bush for a nap? City sleeping would shoot my nerves, but I know that's where all the resources are. How far of a trip is it to find someplace in the wilderness where you wouldn't be bothered? Is it too far to even bother with?
i2ku1d,,g0cuijb,Well Skid Row is in downtown LA. LA is a sprawling city- it's super huge and covers far far distances. There really isn't a "wilderness" unless you go to less populated areas far far away from the city and then the wilderness is desert where you literally will die.   The reason people stick around Skid Row is because there are food and water resources there. Most homeless folks choose not to stay there for safety reasons so they seek out hiding places throughout the city. Some people live on the banks of the LA river which runs on the side of the freeways. Some people hole up in bushes next to markets. You'll see people under bridges next to freeways.
i2ku1d,,g1dnpeb,Omg how cruel and extremely horrible ppl can be toward one another! That made me cry.
i2ku1d,,g05u4b7,That's insane! Anytime I've done gift cards (for participating in focus groups or committees) I've insisted on VISA gift cards that you can use anywhere.
i2ku1d,g05l236,,You are 100% correct. I was homeless with 4 kids and was told by the state to go to a campground in April in New England. There was no other help offered. I‚Äôm lucky that I was able to get back on my feet myself but I saw how the cycle works.   It absolutely is a bipartisan issue but when I was experiencing homelessness, the same state that told me no help was available opened up the gymnasium in a major city for refugees only. Residents were scrambling to provide them with food, clothing and basic necessities. It was an eye opener for me that the government does have the ability to affect some change but seem to choose not to.   To be clear I have no issues with refugees but I am sure anyone can understand how disappointing it was to be told no help was available for me when others were getting help.
i2ku1d,,g05o3kt,Hey, I'm sorry to hear that. The truth is that it really should not be one or the other. We live in the richest country of the entire history of the world, with the most billionaires of any time and we have people on the street. It really shouldn't be this way.
i2ku1d,,g06tysi,America is a failed State.  By the way, that half million statistic didn't even attempt to count those who are car homeless, or couch surfing. I suspect the true number of people without a stable place to sleep is closer to 2-3 million.
i2ku1d,,g07f2ai,A few months ago I scoured the internet and the local main library trying to find the real statistics on the homeless population. It took me a whole frustrating week.HUD historically gets this number wrong intentionally. I found the overall real number at 10 million. 3 million rough sleeping and in shelters and 7 million sleeping on couches, vehicles, jail, and mental institutions.  https://nlchp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/HUD-PIT-report2017.pdf  Edit: it‚Äôs important to know that this number overall changes within the year as some people only experience homelessness for a few months.
i2ku1d,,g09mfs5,Wow. This needs to be publicised A LOT MORE, especially considering it's from HUD themselves and is therefore a credible figure. Well done finding it!  Ten million constitutes a crisis of dramatic proportions; forget the fact that it's 20 times higher than the figure repeated in the media, it's nearly 3% of the entire population of America.  Considering how many unoccupied dwellings there are across the country, I find this to be a completely unnecessary and therefore cruel state of affairs.
i2ku1d,,g0605wd,Seems to me that billionaires are why we have so many people on the street.
i2ku1d,,g06tvoh,You would be absolutely correct; they extract wealth from society by not paying taxes and by exploiting "economic rents" to gain massive profits. Both of these have impoverished America and those living in it.  America is a failed State.
i2ku1d,,g087zor,I disagree.  The countries that do the best at providing a social safety net all have billionaires as well.  A market economy is the best for generating wealth, social democracy does the best at using that wealth for the good of the people.
i2ku1d,,g1dof3t,Exactly America's problem. We are a sinking ship but taking on more ppl from other ships and offering them our life jackets and dinghy's instead to the ones that bought the tickets.
i2ku1d,g05v90h,,I have been very fortunate in my life that I have never endured homelessness or poverty. I get on this sub because I care just as OP pointed out.  When I give to a homeless person I give cash.  Do I need to worry what that person may spend it on?  No. That is their choice.  I know many people who do not agree with me giving cash because of that stupid old thought that they will just buy booze, drugs, etc.  I say do what you need to do for you with the money.
i2ku1d,g05hmvi,,Thank you. This is far better said then I can say it and it‚Äôs always unbelievable to me how many believe these myths but we, as the poor need to understand one of the reasons. Most media is owned by people who don‚Äôt want anything to change and are trying to keep the misinformation alive. So although it‚Äôs the person themselves responsibility to understand, it‚Äôs not their fault that they don‚Äôt yet.
i2ku1d,g05i3g4,,Excellent post. Things are about to ramp up super hard, both in the US as a whole and in this sub as a result, and I'm VERY concerned about how well the people who casually browse here are going to handle it.
i2ku1d,,g05icqc,That's what made me post. I don't want one of these new people on the street to walk up to a cop and ask for help and end up beaten. I also don't want people to have a false hope of the 'system' set up to 'take care of them.'
i2ku1d,,g05iofw,Millions of people are about to head into very murky waters through no fault of their own, and it's frightening. I'm wondering, perhaps naively, whether the voices of people who have been dealing with this shit for longer than most will be not only heard but actually valued soon. I've been considering putting together some type of Word doc of survival tips and tricks for the street but my personal knowledge isn't close to complete.

i2ku1d,g05kflt,,Holy shit, slow clap for you sir/ma'am. This is beautifully spoken... Typed? I love the parts about the police and addicts. I once read the advice of the leader of a shelter here in Delaware where he literally recommends people call the police if they find people camping, because as you said "they'll get the help they need" no, fuck that. Those places are horrible and personally? As a woman, I only went to the shelter for dinner and more or less, I get sexually harassed by the volunteers, and a couple times I rejected them, their treatment of me changed.    The thing about addiction I can relate to, I'm sorry I'm this way, certain things happened to me and I began using, I don't want to live this way, but it's so painful to withdrawal, and the detox places have staff that treat you like subhuman. It gets old. Yes. I use but I'm not subhuman, I'm not a junkie that stole from my family or whored myself out, my crimes are using, and panhandling. I'm truly sorry I'm this way.

i2ku1d,g066dr5,,As someone who is both formerly homeless and volunteered with homeless assistance/rights groups, I really appreciate this post. If I may, I think you should crosspost this to r/youshouldknow or even do a casualAMA. I always like to chime in on posts that mention or discuss homelessness because they'll inevitably get bogged down by the NIMBY crowd or "they're secretly rich people" hysteria.
i2ku1d,g05nel9,,I am so sick of homeless "advocates" telling me what my problems are. Telling us what we need, then talking over us instead of actually listening when we say what we actually need.

i2ku1d,,g05y4b9,I was in a shelter a few times about 10 years ago. I was treated like a child because they saw ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù.   When I ended up homeless earlier this year, I lived in my car for a bit (that I realize I‚Äôm privileged to have) and managed to find a room for rent right before the covid hit the fan.
i2ku1d,,g07yvwf,15 years.
i2ku1d,g06lrwy,,Also, if you're lgbtq you get treated worse.
i2ku1d,g06ouyv,,I believe whats written here is the fact in all states and not only LA. The number of homeless is not really 500000 - its actually more, its just that those people dont interact with the system collecting the data.
i2ku1d,g06eeol,,Just wanted to say thank you for posting your well thought out analysis of our situation that most of us just don't have the energy to write down as well you said it.   Most of the advice I see here is solid but you made some very good points and explained them well.  üëç
i2ku1d,g09q48p,,Fucking thank you!!!  I've seen so much of the same advice. I get that there are people who do care, but so many of them are clueless (for lack of a better term) of the logistics and mentalities that come with being a homeless person trying to get help. "Find the police", "find a homeless shelter", or "find a soup kitchen", is advice thats about as helpful as being told that you'll pray for me.   This post was surely needed!!
i2ku1d,g06jl2d,,Preach!
i2ku1d,g07x5gj,,Front page with you!!! You didn't even mention the homeless sex offenders who won't ever qualify for section 8. Who could possibly face new charges if they are homeless.   My solution? Buy land if possible. Cheap land exists but more importantly cheap taxes. Won't work for everyone though  You sound well versed and tired. Get some rest, take a vacation. You are a great person doing a awesome job. Thanks.

i2ku1d,g05lpxg,,I understand the point of this post, but it is just as prejudicious and discriminatory as some of the issues you mention... Reality is: good and bad advice can come from any source. I myself have received good advice coming from people that have never been homeless or faced poverty, and also I have received awful and dangerous advice from other homeless people.  This forum should filter bad advice instead of straight up asking a certain subset of people not to offer advice.
i2ku1d,,g05txim,This kinda reminds me of when people say feminism is sexist or blm is racist
i2ku1d,,g05uo3t,I don't see the relation, but okay.
i2ku1d,,g05ppc8,I agree with you 100% - thank you for commenting.
i2ku1d,g06mwwx,,What‚Äôs your opinion on Universal Basic Income?
i2ku1d,,g08cue6,I would be in support if there were also strong social safety nets that regulated basic necessities like real rent control and universal healthcare - if not it's just going to be a direct hand out to landlords and other corporations through rent increases and medical expenses.
i2ku1d,,g095qhd,Without rent control, do you think many folks would take the UBI and move some place where they can afford to rent a decent place (rural areas, smaller towns)? Or do you think it'd be more likely for them to try to stay in the city they're in, but now be able to afford more supplies?
i2ku1d,,g09ec56,It's a really complicated issue that is going to take a massive restructuring of the buisness of for-profit housing and vastly expanding public housing.   We have a sort of limited experiment going on right now with social security and veterans' pensions. Payments are about $1,200 in social security a month, some veterans get a vet pension of a similar amount (pension size varies depending on how disabled the government thinks you are.) Those people are still living on the streets in miserable conditions, or in shitty residential motels also in awful conditions. The amount of money is not nearly enough to live anywhere.   If your day to day living is expensive, you have no opportunity to save up a deposit (most apartments require a deposit to be up to 3x as much as rent). Not to mention most states allow denials of housing for criminal convictions, low credit scores, lack of rental history, previous evictions. A huge list of barriers that affects this unhoused population. And one huge barrier in particular for renters of color is good ole fashioned racism. Black people are about 8% of the population of LA and yet make up 40% of homeless people because of discriminatory landlords. A white person with a voucher has almost a 5x higher chance of finding housing than an equally qualified Black person with a voucher does.  And again people are social animals and human beings with preferences. They tend to stay in areas they're familiar with and close to friends and family. Where you live is not always a calculated financial move. Then there is a risk of ending up in a cheap red state with no social safety net like Medicaid or disability support all alone. I, as a fully employed housed person, would be nervous about getting up and going to a new area I knew nobody at. I imagine that fear gets worse the older people are knowing their bodies will be deteriorating and they'll be in need of care and support.   Rural areas and smaller towns usually have less rental property available anyways. I guess there could be a mass building but again, that just means higher demand and higher prices without strong rent control.
i2ku1d,,g09o7d6,Does the social security/vet pension that you get depend on the cost of living in the area of the country you live in?
i2ku1d,,g09qzwb,For social security, slightly. 'A cost of living' increase every few years of a few dollars. The rules are complicated. Social security payments stop if you're homeless for long enough too. https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-living-ussi.htm  Veterans pensions are calculated through the percentage of disability. The government will say you're 35% disabled so you get $400 a month, they have a chart for it.   The cost of living numbers that things like Social Security are based on have not been updated since the 80s. There is a giant wave of evictions of seniors that I witnessed in really high cost of living areas like San Francisco. If you don't have a family ready and willing to supplement your care and move you in, you're fucked.
i2ku1d,,g09sok0,I reviewed that rather depressing link and do not see anything about losing your payments if you are homeless for long enough.
i2ku1d,,g09tfux,https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-living-arrangements.htm  "If you live in a public shelter, you can receive SSI benefits for up to 6 months out of any 9 months that you live there."
i2ku1d,,g09u5pa,Ahh... the other link you shared simply said this:   **WHAT IF YOU ARE HOMELESS?**  *We figure your benefit amount the same as we do for a person who lives in his own house, apartment, or mobile home.*

i2ku1d,g05var9,,Defund the police
i2ku1d,g065pvw,,> I've seen people respond to folks seeking advice with "Call the cops, they'll help you and get you the help you need." which is just an absurdly privileged statement. A lot of cops treat homeless people like sub-human shit  It depends on what you expect. If you treat others with respect, that respect will normally be returned to you - even if you're homeless. I've known many police officers who will buy a homeless person a cup of coffee or a meal. Most of the time, the police will simply ask you nicely to move on. Where homeless get in trouble is insisting on their 'rights' (which are frequently not actual rights) and pushing back against reasonable instructions from a police officer.  That being said, I can't imagine calling the police for much of anything. Even a housed person isn't likely to get their stolen stuff back. The cops can't protect you 24/7, so if someone is hassling you, there's not much they can do.  Note: The *police* aren't the ones deciding to do a sweep. That's above their pay grade. Police sweep encampments because they're ordered to do so, not because they just wake up one morning and want to screw with someone.  > I see people here telling people to just get on Section 8.   HUD VASH has a considerably shorter list if you qualify. Moreover, Section 8 varies from place to place.  > Nevermind that a ton of landlords flat out don't accept the subsidy as a form of payment.  This cuts both ways. If you're talking about an upscale community, they don't like Section 8 because it means poor people and crime. If you're talking about a poor neighborhood, they love Section 8 because it guarantees payment (at least in part).  > I've seen people posting that they do not believe in giving unhoused people money. You do realize that unhoused people need things other than an occasional restaurant meal right?   Panhandlers are not necessarily unhoused. Indeed, a fair number of them are simply professional panhandlers exploiting your sympathies.  The truth of the matter is that giving money to a stranger is rarely 'helping' them in the manner you think it is. Mostly, you're just playing into their game of exploiting your sympathies. If this isn't a problem for you, then go ahead and do it.  > 500,000 people are homeless right now in the US, and that number is about to grow exponentially - through no personal fault of those people. This is a systemic problem. This is a problem in both Democratic and Republican states.   Er... kinda.  Homelessness usually isn't a 'problem' in rural areas because (a) there's generally an unskilled, informal labor shortage and (b) the kind of people who are homeless in rural areas tend to be very self-sufficient.  But in urban areas, there tend to be services that permit people to survive easily without ever having to take any sort of personal responsibility. Moreover, as you ramp up these services, you create a paradox where the 'bad' homeless drive out the 'good' homeless.  That's why you see so many people saying things like "avoid homeless shelters". When I was in boot camp, we had 80 men to a barracks. But there was neither theft nor assault. Put 80 homeless people in the same bunk room and pretty soon the victimizers drive out the victims.  And that's *if* you don't run across the social workers who view their profession as a way to profit off of misery. Which are far more common than you might think.  You might also consider that "working with the homeless" doesn't give you a complete picture. The majority of homeless people aren't going to associate with an "outreach org" and they're not going to be visible to you. A lot of people who you do find on the streets are going to be obsequious or obnoxious depending on who they're dealing with - the person you think is nice and agreeable will be the same person who steals and stabs back in the camp.  I always like to stress that there's a *reason* people are homeless - and the umbrella reason is that they lack a social support network.  But the reasons for that can vary widely. Some people simply aged out of foster care. Some people had their (limited) support network break down. Some have mental health problems. But some people are such toxic individuals that any possible support system would be destroyed by their behavior.
i2ku1d,,g06gnjd,Way to illustrate OP's point, Bonne Homme
i2ku1d,g06579g,,I haven't read every post, but I've never seen anyone tell a homeless person to call the police for help (unless in need of help from the police, such as being a crime victim, for instance).  I have seen posters recommend calling 211, to get referrals, not just for short-term shelter, but for other resources and services as well. Possible needs: ID, mailing address, food, transit tickets, clothing, laundry/showers, etc.   I've also seen recommendations to not unnecessarily delay applying for SNAP, Medicaid, SSI/SSDI, etc., and getting on housing/voucher waiting lists. Also for therapy/treatment, if applicable.  That's not to suggest that sufficient solutions are readily available or easily acquired. It can be a trap, because it can be very difficult to climb out of it.
i2ku1d,g06q48q,,Don't make blanket, oversimplified statements. What's privileged is you assuming and implying that all homeless people think the same.. üòí
i2ku1d,,g07ymaa,Privileged baby who refuses to self examine and grow as a person says "what"
i2ku1d,,g07z30d,You're the one who's "privileged" here, being an enabler and apologist.
i2ku1d,,g07zzf3,Privileged? Yes, it was lovely having the privilege of getting MRSA multiple times, having people assume I was an addict so refusing to help, stupid teenagers pranking me, cops destroying my shit, having a criminal record with nothing but camping tickets and the complex PTSD and Bone disease I developed on top of my latent mental health issues. It was a privilege to starve, it was a privilege to be sexually assaulted on the regular and having everything I own in the world including my ID (how I got in the situation in the first place) be an entire 3 week mission for 15 fucking years. SUCH A FUCKING PRIVILEGE. I HOPE YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY, TOO.
i2ku1d,,g080ttg,You're privileged for being an abuser enabler.  I said what I said.   Your experiences don't give you an excuse or a pass to be an abuser enabler. With or without your life story, everyone has a moral obligation to take accountability for their actions.   Can you clarify, did you just say that you hope I have the opportunity to get sexually assaulted regularly?
i2ku1d,,g0814qd,You are a bigot for acting like homelessness is a personal failing. People in houses LOVE to assault homeless people. You just want to dismiss a social problem by blanketing, and any idiot can detract that way
i2ku1d,,g081g18,No? I'm the one saying some people aren't victims and they terrorise the rest of homeless people. Which you deny, because according to you there's no abuse people that live on the streets and prey on their own community.
i2ku1d,,g081wn8,I didnt deny jack shit, people in survival scenarios give less fucks, go fucking figure. "Your society creates criminals, then deems it their right to punish them" but of course it's all about YOU with your legal place to live, running water, ability to store and cook food and washing machine and shower you probably should use more often
i2ku1d,,g0ary3v,Don't confuse mediocre life (access to a house, running water, ...) with privilege. If you don't have those things it doesn't mean the other person is privileged. It means that you are (way) below average according to average western standards and that there is some issue or problem that needs fixing. I won't touch on the subject of WHAT those issues might be since they're different for everyone and that's not the point I'm trying to make. But privilege != normal life. Easier said than done and sure go screenshot this comment and post it on r/thanksimcured, but the thought process behind calling mediocre people privileged is flawed, defeatist, will not get you anywhere and is in the end plain dangerous due to the anger you start developing towards perfectly mediocre people. Gotta realize that being homeless isn't the norm.
i2ku1d,,g0827cb,Yes you did but enabling abuse, and now, justifying abuse.   I don't?
i2ku1d,,g082bso,Enabling abuse by being a homeless person? That's fucking cute

You think I'm a "garage person" for saying that? Abusers aren't entitled to OTHER'S homes and abusers aren't entitled to someone's places that should be safe.  Another reason why you're a "garage person" is because you erase the experiences of homeless people who have been taken advantage of by abusers on the streets.

But in the last couple of days, I have also been visited by some awesome Reddit angels who have shown me that there ARE really good and kind people out there. It means so much. I am so grateful.
i24v3j,,g03f0rz,Right? The Redditor who offered to write songs for people who could help him said it really well: "I guess Reddit is my new family now because they have helped me more especially in my current crisis, cared more and listened to me more than my own bio family ever has." That is some seriously relatable content right there.
i24v3j,,g03htqg,Exactly. Could not agree more. I am totally alone out here - as most of us  probably are. No family, no friends, no classmates, no coworkers, no roommates......nobody. As terrible as everything has been lately, it would be a lot worse if I didn't have this sub. You guys are the only ones to get it. I am not good at asking for help, so it is like a true blessing when anyone contacts me to ask if they can do anything for me. With so many people treating others (and especially homeless people - both online and IRL) badly,  it is so nice to find out there are people on the other end of the spectrum - trying to compensate for the assholes.
i24v3j,,g03ithn,Redditors - especially in this sub - remind me of that saying after 9/11: "If you see something, say something." Only with r/homeless it's more like the folks reading this respond with: "I hear you. I see you. How can I best help you?"   Like seriously - where else does such "just help them ffs" loving energy exist in this World? Answer: Nowhere.

They're simply a few regular folks pulling wagons of wound care supplies (saline, bandages etc), they are well-masked/ppe'd, and walk around cleaning and bandaging wounds, handing out water etc.   It's *very* cool!
i16zlq,fzv2k5m,,I'm just going to put this out there.  1. Homeless people have been woken up by thieves attempting to remove their backpacks from their backs while they are asleep... and your device would be easier than that to take from a sleeping homeless person. 2. A backpack is still a better option as it can do everything your device can do, and more.

i16zlq,g09dywy,,Don't bog people down with more stuff.  More stuff that can be stolen, broken, sold, ect.  why not work on tools/devices that help people/organizations that help the homeless?

For example, [San Diego](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/controversial-homeless-parking-lot-up-for-vote-in-encinitas/2248349/) parking program.  Having a safe place to sleep helps much with mental health.

Every once in a while I see someone say they've been approved for housing, a hotel room etc....yet nobody ever explains how or what this is or what the process or procedure is. Hopefully someday, someone will let the rest of us know what the secret is. Until then, I consider it to be right up there with UFOs, The Easter Bunny, mermaids and unicorns.
hzuhwf,,fzmiyhk,Depends on what they were approved for. They likely don't explain, because in a majority of homeless situations the process of whatever they are applying for, is assisted by social workers to navigate a convoluted system.  If you really want to know, throw out an "approval" for housing or services and I'll tell you what you need to do. (At least in my state)

hyvty1,fzfk6q1,,If anyone ever needed to do a TED TALK it is you, Sir. Just WOW. The two most important nuggets of wisdom in your story IMO are: 1) N/A - too much religion not enough recovery. Truer words were never spoken. Do you know by AA's own admission they have a 7% long-term sobriety success rate? And included in that "path to success" is 11 relapses before permanent sobriety is achieved? Good you gave up on that bucket of shit. 2) You kept doing the OPPOSITE of what "the experts" tell you to do. Boom! Took me 2 months too long to realize that exact same path forward. The experts told me to file for disability so I applied for jobs instead and am starting Census Training in August. Also - your raw determination to persevere likely contributed much to your success.  I am newly homeless (displaced by COVID19) so don't have an "I Made It Success Story" to share with you. But hopefully I will soon. Keep on keeping on, oh persistent one. I have a feeling the sky is the limit for you from here on out. Congratulations.
hyvty1,,fzfqn7h,That is the best complement!  Thank you :)  Ironically, I finally lost my religion after this experience. I miss it, but there's something in learning to trust myself that goes against the principals of Christianity.  Good job on taking the jobs that are out there. Once you close the gap in your work history, it's a lot easier to get a second job.   You too will do great things my friend. Stay strong!
hyvty1,,fzfv3pn,Actually I don't have a work gap. I worked until I got COVID19+ bilateral pneumonia first week of March. In ICU 79 days. Came out to a shut down Country and no resources available because nobody was working during the SIP Mandate. It was only when <some agencies> started opening again part-time that I started to realize what a total scam the "homeless outreach programs" really are. I have a law degree + 2 Master's Degrees and no history of any substance abuse - not even cigs or MJ. So I'm generally very employable - just not so much in an economy with 50 million unemployed. But our greatest adversity defines us for it shapes our greatest strengths. This I believe.
hyvty1,,fzfxz6c,Holy shit. Sounds like 28 days later. I want to hear your story. On the front lines of Covid. You need to start writing a movie script.
hyvty1,,fzfzju3,Yeah my story is pretty harrowing. I literally coded twice. Woke up the 2nd time to a critical care nurse sobbing beside me saying "I won't let you die. I just won't!" I now pray for her family every day because she died of COVID19 3 weeks later. I was present for this COVID19 nightmare very early on so I have my own opinions on things related to COVID19. But lacking proper PPE and NOBODY keeping a safe distance in the early months in the hospitals didn't help matters AT ALL.
hyvty1,,fzg3d38,Holy shit, that part about the nurse who cared so much about you dying hit me right in the feels.
hyvty1,,fzfzzj0,> I started to realize what a total scam the "homeless outreach programs" really are.  Tell me more about this, please. What works and what does not?
hyvty1,,fzghzf6,If I told you what I really think of the utterly failed "homeless outreach agencies" it would likely devastate too many people here. Plus, a part of me hopes my experience was specific to my regional  area but I have my doubts because I'm hearing too many stories IDENTICAL (if not worse) to mine from all over the Country.  But I am writing a story for NPR about my experience & observations being newly, first-time homeless as well as my recommendations for useful change in the broken system.  I am certain they will censor some of the more brutal truths of homelessness but at least I can shine a bright light on the problem.  My best advice? What the OP said: whatever the "so-called helpers/homeless advocacy experts" tell you to do - do the exact opposite of that and you will already be ahead by a large margin. Don't associate with other homeless people ever. And make it a full-time 10 hour per day job working on clawing your way back to civil society. Seriously, make a 25 item to do list every night at 9pm for the next day. And don't quit working that list until it is done EACH & EVERY DAY.
hyvty1,,fzh9j8g,I agree. I hardly ever associated with my fellow homeless. I was a ghost. Work leads to money and money will get you the hell out of there.
hyvty1,fzftwpx,,Okay so day one. After a pretty bad but usual fight i got kicked in the testies a hand full of times and i was dont with that shit and i had just turned 18 and could finally leave that hell hole.  I had what i keep in my pockets ie wallet and assorted components. Pocket knife with some screw drivers and plyers. And thats it . I also have my bike that i was saving up to rebuild. It doesnt have breaks and its stuck in gear four. I have to manually readjust the derailer if i want to get anoughter gear. I went out in just some direction and kept going. I went kind of northish.  Randomly went left just to see. I found i little cluster of stuff. The thing that caught my attention was a store i had passed by but never been into  I hit every store that would hire a new 18 year old. The last one before i was gonna go as far as possible and find a place to sleep. That little mechanic shop set me up in their sister store that had a car wash. It was back in the direction that i came from but it was a job.  I signed up for the required healthcare because i wanted the security. Its day seven and because of rain i have only been able to work two days.  Im pretty hungry. I have eaten today. Im not thirsty. Water is the only thing that i will have to buy everyday but when i have enough i am going to get a twelve pack of water and itll be cheaper and ill get more water.  Im tired. I havent been getting good sleep.  Ill update later dudes.  New account because all old accounts are comprimised.
hyvty1,fzfp3f6,,This is great to hear, congratulations and thanks for sharing!
hyvty1,fzfqj91,,Want to personally Congratulate you for your persistence and every obstacle you overcame during all these years. There is nothing more rewarding in life than digging yourself out if your own whole. There's nothing in this world you can't do and I hope you never forget that fighter spirit in you üôå
hyvty1,,fzg7e7i,Thank you!   That one is easy to forget. It's incredible how easy it is to lose gratitude. One day I'm worrying about if I'm going to get permission to go to my nephew's birthday party from the people in charge of the homeless shelter, the next I'm sick of everything on Uber eats and I'm too lazy to cook.    Now that I have a little something, I'm afraid of risking it and going back.
hyvty1,fzfdzqi,,Thank you. I think about homeless people every day and I wonder how it is possible to escape. You are really inspiring.
hyvty1,,fzffptb,I think that if we take away the stigma of homelessness, and more people talk about escaping it, then maybe more people can have hope.
hyvty1,,fzfg7p9,Yes we not generally a caring country. Maybe stories like this will show people how difficult it is to pull out of a rut. OP has skills and sounds young enough to bounce back but some homeless just can't work due to age, health, mental issues.
hyvty1,,fzfi90d,Absolutely. I got lucky. I'm 34 now, btw. I fought drug addiction and some mental health issues, but there were so many others for whom this isn't an option. Good men and women that are too broken inside to do what I did. There was this one man, John, the most soft spoke, God loving man I ever knew. He was so nice! But his demons got the best of him and he went back out.   My story isn't unique, but it takes a lot of luck, probably some privilege, help from the right people and some hard work and dedication. It's just not possible for everyone.
hyvty1,,fzfnm6k,I've been in the same boat with addiction. A heavy addiction can destroy you. I wonder how many percent actually are able to work their way out of homelessness like you did? A small percentage? I'm asking because it bothers me to see people living under bridges, in tent cities. Do you think there are any practical solutions to help with rising homelessness? It costs $30,000 to $70,000 a year to house an inmate. Why can't we afford to house people and give them access to showers etc.?
hyvty1,,fzfr4il,I believe in housing first. One, it's cheaper. Two, if you treat the homeless like humans and don't make them dance for their dinner, you'd be amazed at how many people would go out and do the right thing. It shouldn't have been as hard as it was for me and it shouldn't take so much luck.
hyvty1,,fzfrwth,Thank you. Yes it would need to start with basic shelter and showing some respect.
hyvty1,,fzfie9h,Thank you by the way for calling me inspiring. I appreciate the compliment.
hyvty1,,fzfnqj9,It is an incredible accomplishment.
hyvty1,fzgif5i,,Very encouraging update for those that may find themselves a few steps behind. Thank you for sharing!
hyvty1,,fziokky,Of course! I hope others are encouraged to do the same.
hyvty1,fzgjkmq,,That's just beautiful, i'm really glad you're having your part of the cake now.
hyvty1,fzgts2b,,Congrats!  Paid off student loans.  Used to living with minimal money so I reduced my working hours.  Used extra time to improve people skills.  Got a better job.  Life improved.
hyvty1,,fzgvacx,Happy cake day my friend! Congratulations! Good job on doing what so many cannot.
hyvty1,fzsqd5r,,Huge congrats to you. Thanks for sharing your experience
hxz4y2,fz9lj4i,,Its a problem every where
hxz4y2,fz9pxw4,,I think a significant percentage of the new homeless are in cars, at least for now, which makes them harder to see.  I met an older lady who said she had a choice between her car payment and a room. She picked the car.
hxz4y2,,fzc2zlu,>I met an older lady who said she had a choice between her car payment and a room. She picked the car.  Smart lady.
hxz4y2,fz9k24u,,I just left Niagara (Canadian side). The City set up a camp for them. Porta-potty, trash and recycling bins,  and fresh water delivered daily. Its a nice gesture, but it's more to appease the local businesses and taxpayers don't want to see them.  About two dozen in all.   I stayed a few days with them before I left town.  Mostly good peeps who caught some tough breaks.   I just arrived in Pembroke Ontario. First person I met was living out of a shopping cart.  Also a good guy who had some shit luck.  He's the only one I've seen so far but I'm sure there's more around here somewhere.
hxz4y2,fz9o3i7,,I think pretty well every major city on the west coast has a homeless issue. Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, LA, and I guess if Denver is joining the club, I'm not surprised.
hxz4y2,fzczl6n,,Yeah but in colorado... everyone is taken care of. All the homeless people eating and living as best as they can... down in south florida its increasing for sure. Corners are causing severe competition. Everyone greedy nobody wanna share. Its like everyone can have a piece... rotate every hour
hx4gjv,fz3pj4t,,My original post was about my recovery since being admitted but it wasn't good enough I suppose.
hx4gjv,,fz3x65i,Hey Hannah. I see your post here. How are you doing right now, are you still hospitalized? Are you feeling safe there?
hx4gjv,,fz3z6ld,I'm doing a little better. Swelling gone down but not 100% starving because they won't feed me regular food. I'm leaving tonight though.
hx4gjv,,fz3ziv1,Do you know where you will go next? Do you have a plan?
hx4gjv,,fz40he4,I was planning on going to live with someone I met on here but people started talking about how he was a pedophile and he hasn't contacted me since. So right now I'm looking at just being homeless again.
hx4gjv,,fz421np,Yeah I want to echo what those people have said..there are many dangerous predators on here looking for people in desperate situations. Have you told the hospital that you have nowhere to go when you leave there? They are supposed to help you find shelter. Would you consider telling them this, if you feel safe to do so?
hx4gjv,,fz42r5u,They know I don't have a place to go. They're expecting my case worker to put me in a place but I refuse. I'm leaving the hospital tonight and trust me being homeless is 100% better than possibly being put in a foster home.
hx4gjv,,fz4xlt0,I believe you. 100%. Do you have long until you turn 18, so that you can start working and find a place of your own?
hx4gjv,,fz51uuu,I was living with a friend and her family recently. I had a part time job too. Due to everything that has happened though I'm now homeless and jobless. My original plan was to move into a room for rent. I had some money in my pocket to get started and everything. But as it turns out people either don't want to rent to me or require more money to get started like for deposits. I still have the $350 I've been holding on to but at this point it's a lost cause.
hwv5er,fz6566a,,Dollar tree and Wally world are both good and cheap. I'm sure you friend will be appreciative no matter what!  Thanks for being an awesome friend!
hwv5er,,fz9qwt1,Thank you! I did do for dollar tree but I had no luck and I couldn‚Äôt find him
hwv5er,,fz9re1x,Cool beans. Even if it didn't work out, good looking out my guy/guy/ette. Wish the best for you.
hw41wm,fyxc893,,Love to see this. Ive seen a couple subways in my city give out free sandwiches to the homeless for an hour everyday, no questions asked.  What restaurant is this? id gladly bomb them with a 5 star review lol
hw41wm,,fyxdwb5,Me three!
hw41wm,fyxgkxp,,I always hated to do this.  I'd always feel embarrassed, too shy. I'd never do it. I'm more of a shadow dig in the dumpster at midnight type. Lol.
hw41wm,,fyxpniz,Understandable. Which is why [this](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/01/14/377033772/philadelphia-pizza-lovers-pay-it-forward-one-slice-at-a-time) was so amazing. Anyone can walk in and grab a slice without any questions asked.
hw41wm,,fyzzkx2,I saw this place on Food Network and it is such a cool idea and I love how it has taken off. So easy yet so impressive
hw41wm,,fyzc4nz,Same here
hw41wm,fyxidrf,,There's a place in KCMO that's doing this for the homeless and they're some of the best people I've ever met. Sheng's Chinese restaurant at Linwood and Broadway, is case you're wondering.
hw41wm,,i0kilvy,I live in KCMO, thanks for this.
hw41wm,,i0lo23p,The business has since closed down. Although, Gold Dome at 11th and Broadway serves breakfast and coffee at 7 AM, Tuesday through Friday.
hw41wm,fyxaq0r,,What's the place called? This is awesome to see!
hw41wm,fyxnjuf,,Aw so sweet of them.  I walk up to walmart manager in day time and say hey im hungry can you help me? Or chic fil a or McDonalds ive done it too. Always got fed. I feel ashamed but at least my tummy is full for a little bit
hw41wm,,fyyim2o,I have had really good luck with this. I always ask if I can clean something or take out trash in exchange for food. Having worked in food services, I know damn well that 99% of the time they wont let you work if not an employee. Something about insurance liability. But the managers love that attitude of willing to work for food and I have gotten seriously hooked up. The best was at a burger king on like 9 mile near Detroit. Two huge double whopper meals and two pieces of Hershey pie.
hw41wm,,fyyts1q,I used to offer to break down boxes behind liquor stores for smokes or beverages.  They always had a lot of boxes to break down, takes up a lot of their time. Offering to  do it out back by the dumpster is more comfortable , if they don't want you inside.  Sometimes that led to doing other odd jobs, sweeping, cleaning a bathroom. Bars and restaurants same thing. Start out back doing menial, labor intensive chores.
hw41wm,,fyyout7,Mmm hershey pies.
hw41wm,fyxpowl,,Shit, here in LA, the signs all say "stay away" because of covid
hw41wm,fyxg336,,Where is this? Would love to spread the word.
hw41wm,fyzcqb7,,I think everyone wants to know where this is at. I too would love to know where it is to spread the word. I think it's so important that people have compassion at a time like this.
hw41wm,fz08b9w,,Like a boss.
hw41wm,fyyinbt,,Now they go out of business because of this reddit post...
hw41wm,,fyzj377,I think it's because they're using it as a noun rather than an adjective
hw41wm,j6ct4vx,,Id buy from a store like this and make it a point to go here as much as possible. We need more humanity and empathy
hut3bd,fyp74z8,,Which state and mind telling me how u did it? Pm me if u wanna keep it discreet
hut3bd,fypmazz,,Congratulations. I hope you are able to rebuild your life.  A year goes by fast. You are welcome to join us on r/GigWorks if you are looking for ways to develop an income without a "regular" job.
hut3bd,fypuhio,,Amazing. PM if I can send you a ‚Äúhousewarming‚Äù gift via amazon... not sure if that‚Äôs allowed here
hut3bd,fyq5cbt,,I‚Äôve been reading about a lot of cities doing this and I cannot even imagine how awesome this must feel! Congratulations!!! And enjoy!!!
hut3bd,fyrm234,,Info / details / instructions......how did you do it? Who is the contact? How does it work? What is the procedure? I keep hearing about this but as far as I can tell it is just a fairy tale.
hu2dx9,fykib2m,,Please make sure you are getting enough salt.  The combination of no food and lots of water and lots of sweating can lead to electrolyte imbalance.  Not a doctor but the dizziness and weakness sounds like it might have already started.
hu2dx9,fykmwm7,,Do you need Gatorade, ice, water or anything? I'm in Raleigh and can hook you up with some supplies.
hu2dx9,,fym6pxc,I will cash app you to get some Off spray if you hook him up .
hu2dx9,,fymawgj,I worked for a company last summer that had me out in the heat during the hottest hours of the day. Electrolyte replacement was done with Emergen-C packets in water. Doesn't taste bad, and does the trick
hu2dx9,,fynrcvp,Hey. Sorry for the delay. My internet is extremely limited now. I might take you up on that offer if I can't figure some changes out .....so much appreciate the offer.
hu2dx9,,fyo5aqt,No worries.  Lemme know what you or others need.  I can bring water, Gatorade, bug spray, or whatever.
hu2dx9,,fyl7ddp,A cheaper alternative is mixing sugar and water and salt together.
hu2dx9,,fylo8be,Sure but it tastes like crap. I'd rather hook someone up if I can.
hu2dx9,,fylu966,Only if your ratios are off. 1 quart of water + 1/2 tsp of salt + 1 tbsp honey + about 4 tbsps of lemon juice makes a decent concoction and is substantially cheaper than Gatorade.
hu2dx9,,fylw2c2,Sure but I'm not sure a homeless person has those readily available.
hu2dx9,,fyly992,I get them from some local breakfast places.  Sometimes they will give them if you ask or go in for a cup of coffee.
hu2dx9,,fymxi10,But usually you have to have the ratio right.
hu2dx9,fykkxbf,,>The county has also opened a temporary overnight cooling shelter  This bothers me.  It's hotter under *the sun,* so maybe they should be open during the day, too.
hu2dx9,,fykreyu,I assume it's so people can get a decent night's sleep since sleeping in cooler conditions is the most ideal
hu2dx9,,fyks6d3,Yes.  My point was that it would be wise for them to open it in the daytime as well.  Be cause it *is* hot and some people work at night
hu2dx9,,fykotz3,That makes sense... where I am they are only open during the day. And the library is open too.
hu2dx9,,fynrp6m,Holy crap - there is a library that is actually OPEN somewhere? I have searched everywhere in the southeast US and haven't found one yet. I checked out the Barnes and Noble and they have like 5 tables all with signs saying 30 minute limit.
hu2dx9,fykhv9a,,Parking garages. Underground parking garages are best. Some have outlets.  Try downloading STRAPPD from the app store. It might be able to show you where some shelters and showers are near you.
hu2dx9,,fykjsoc,Yeah, but Op should be carefully about enclosed places where cars exhaust fumes can poison them. If not many cars, maybe ok
hu2dx9,,fykjnf1,Parking garages are the best, but hard to find one without security assholes giving you a hard time for wanting to live. I am going to check again to see if the Barnes and Nobles are letting people sit at the tables again. The last time I was there, they had all the tables gone. Back when all this shit started in March, I was hoping for a hotel room just because every place was in lock-down. It had not occurred to me what a  fucking nightmare things would be when we got to summer, so while I made it through the Spring, I thought for sure they would have figured something out re: the libraries by now. I guess they just don't care.
hu2dx9,,fym3ogh,In Charlotte, people are sitting in Barnes.
hu2dx9,,fykompl,Can you hide behind a car in the parking structure, up against a cool wall? Sitting/laying down? I imagine you could hide that way easily ... Perhaps behind a vending machine?  Go into a walmart with a cart ... hide in the bathroom... go into the family bathroom that is a single and lock yourself in to rest for a bit.
hu2dx9,,fylxj9y,STOP FUCKING TELLING PEOPLE TO LOCK THEMSELVES IN THE BATHROOM.   Garbage like this advice is EXACTLY why homeless people are not allowed in some bathrooms PERIOD. Not to mention, you sound like a fourteen year old child, making such a suggestion.    Those of us who have IBS/etc suffer, due to your absolutely shitty advice.  I hope bathroom karma comes for you and swiftly (and messily!). You definitely deserve it.
hu2dx9,,fyuwebn,Fuck off. He's dying. That outranks your IBS.
hu2dx9,fykeogi,,I can't believe this shit is happening in the US. I read that the government isn't spraying the mosquitos this year bc of the pandemic (which makes zero sense), and it is legit getting hotter all the time. Recently it was over 90¬∞ in the Artic.   We are in big trouble. I'm so sorry planet earth sucks so bad üòî
hu2dx9,,fykk1gs,Planet earth doesn't suck, people made it suck.  Unless that's what you meant.
hu2dx9,,fykk7f4,Yeah, 100%
hu2dx9,,fyl538t,That also means that people can make it better!
hu2dx9,,fylas6t,We have to want to in large enough numbers to make a difference. I hope that tipping point is close but I don't see it yet.
hu2dx9,,fylu0y6,You have to want to AND have actual good ideas and solutions. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."  Unfortunately, a lot of the people that run the world have had cushy lives every step of the way and can't wrap their heads around the kinds of problems we have currently. If you can't whip out your American Express and pay for a solution, some of our so-called World Leaders got nothin'.
hu2dx9,,fylwc3l,WE is the operative term; WE, collectively as Americans, can and ultimately must solve the problems of homelessness because capitalism certainly won't; in fact, capitalism is the cause of homelessness and is making more as far as it can, because profits! ...at least for the few who are already rich.   No one can do it alone.  I completely agree that a big part of the problem lies with people who were born wealthy and have never experienced any kind of real hardship. Donald Trump and family are prime example of the kind of people such an environment generates.  There are studies that show a high inverse correlation between wealth and empathy; the richer people are, the less they care about others. This is why the extremely wealthy as a class are so dangerous and why I feel they must be taxed back into the middle class.
hu2dx9,,fylxa2o,No, no one can do it alone. And I'm not talking about empathy. I'm talking about people failing to understand the problem entirely because it is alien to their experience.  Yes, rich people can be awful. But even the ones who mean well and sincerely care often Just Don't Get It.  Anyway, I have been studying housing issues, etc, for years. This preceded my stint on the street and I feel I have a fair understanding of what needs to be done.  But have no power to get anything done. The years I spent homeless are an excuse to dismiss me as a big fat nobody, not a reason to respect my opinions as being informed by not only study but firsthand experience.  So I don't know how we get there from here. Meanwhile, I try to provide what little support I can via Reddit and my blogs while continuing to scrape by myself because I still don't make enough money, though at least I'm no longer homeless.
hu2dx9,,fym28jd,You are on the sharp tip of the conundrum; you know the scope and particulars of the problems involved but have no money or power.  Those who have money and power are not interested in helping anyone but themselves, even though that very selfishness is exactly what will bring down civilisation itself.   I'm not rich either. I've also been homeless, thankfully for only a short period but long enough to understand what it means and how hopeless it can feel.   I'm in the midst of a startup that can solve food problems for those with the resources to take advantage of it but at the moment I don't have any money either.  This really feels like things are breaking down in fundamental ways. If we don't drastically change the direction of our country, things will unravel fast and hard and leave a trail of destruction we may never recover from.  That's why it's time to kick the oligarchs out of power, by any means necessary. I know it's a seemingly impossible task but hundreds of millions of Americans working together are an irresistible force. The key is uniting us. That's what I've been working on in my free time...
hu2dx9,,fym2km6,> That's why it's time to kick the oligarchs out of power, by any means necessary.  Not really my thing. I'm more of a "light one small candle rather than curse the dark" kind of person. I blog. I run r/GigWorks. I run r/ClothingStartups.   Still trying to figure out how to grow a small candle into a bonfire. Meanwhile, I do what I can and I have reason to believe that matters.
hu2dx9,,fyla8yf,The US government is using the pandemic to kill off and / or imprison as many poor people as it possibly can
hu2dx9,fykgd49,,Can you get a tent to put in the woods?  It's cooler there and you can stretch out in your skivvies, bug free.  Not the best solution,  but maybe better than a sheet.
hu2dx9,,fykp0xp,I wouldn‚Äôt bother with a tent... that would be hotter, to me... find some shade, strip down ... cool off. In the woods, somewhere private. :o)
hu2dx9,,fykr20x,Hes getting bit by bugs... he needs a tent.  Yeah its hot to sit inside durinf the day but at night it isnt as bad especially in ur panties or boxers.
hu2dx9,,fykvrkl,We were discussing day time heat... that‚Äôs what I was referring to.
hu2dx9,,fykxa2w,Then a tent is a fucking sauna in the day
hu2dx9,,fykxjph,Yep... that‚Äôs why I suggested finding private shade to strip down in.
hu2dx9,,fym8291,?
hu2dx9,,fymysvx,It sounds like he doesnt have the funds for a tent, genius.
hu2dx9,,fynhtq1,Who said anything about funds?
hu2dx9,fylyc9y,,This thread needs to make the top page. People need to know about this, and it may even happen to them someday... especially if we keep having government like this.
hu2dx9,fykxbx2,,I would go to e.r. and tell them your suicidal, or go to rehab. Fuck all that.
hu2dx9,,fyl2mgw,Yeah that's actually what I'm going to do so I have a place to live for 2 months.
hu2dx9,,fyl7e5d,I‚Äôve been in your shoes take it easy they can help you find housing. I met my girlfriend in rehab we‚Äôve been clean together almost 2 years.
hu2dx9,fykxan5,,Happy Cake Day.  Try to camp in shade near running water. Air around running water's cooler than further away. Like [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQYo0j1Rn7-hgfDtPD5DNEcjQfFdpXtbkiQJA&usqp=CAU).   If possible, even orient your tent with the breeze.  If  you have a more permanent hideout, you can try making a simple ac using [bottles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qyb2axBQzQ). Again, it'd be better if you can orient it with the breeze.
hu2dx9,,fyluild,>Try to camp in shade near running water. Air around running water's cooler than further away. Like    >   >this  Yes. To expand on that: Look for microclimates that are cooler than surrounding areas.  Look for shady spots that stay shady during the day so they never completely heat up.  Consider soaking your clothes down so that evaporative cooling helps wick the heat away.  Ditto on have some Gatorade, salty snacks, etc. I always bought Gatorade during heat waves when I was homeless.
hu2dx9,,fynqnny,Thank you for the ideas. So appreciate the people on here. You are all the best.
hu2dx9,fymmgv1,, May be time for a visit to an urgent care or Public Health clinic, if you need extended care you might get a few days inpatient to rest and recuperate. You do need to checked out, you might be past the point that Gatorade or electrolyte drinks help.
hu2dx9,,fymz2pq,Probably the most accessible advice here! Now go get some gatorade in those veins op
hu2dx9,,fynpu3j,OK will try to find some. Water is the only thing I ever drink since it is free but maybe you are right. Thank you.
hu2dx9,,fyt8i9s,Maybe powerade zero. No crazy surgar additive and doesnt hurt my teeth and a dollar at walmart
hu2dx9,fykhfc8,,Hi, I am so so sorry you are dealing with this. Our system doesn't do NEARLY enough about the basic wellbeing of our people.  Is there a way you can get a natural bug repellent spray for your body? Could you find a way to set up a tarp above your head, like 6 feet above the ground, a material that doesn't magnify the heat, and just sit under it? Can you get yourself a handheld fan? A water spray bottle? An ice cooler to keep ice in and keep putting a few in your water bottle and/or spray bottle, and a towel to dry off? Are any beaches or parks open where there's a breeze or some water to be around? Do you have any sort of building near by you can be in for at least part of the day to break up the periods you're spending in the heat or to spend the hottest parts of the day in? Like spending 11-2 pm in a grocery store, department store, etc.
hu2dx9,,fynsc5u,Hey. thanks for your thoughtful reply and sorry for the delay. Internet extremely limited these days. I have been trying to get down to the coast (120 miles away), but one disaster after another has prevented it for the last 2 months. So grateful to see all the responses from others on here. Makes me feel not so alone.
hu2dx9,fykyhd2,,can you spray yourself down with bug spray to deal with bugs, then get some ice from a restaurant and rub the ice all over your neck, face and armpits?
hu2dx9,,fynqet9,I am just giving up on the spot I had been in - it worked for the last few months, but the mosquitoes just ruined it along with the heat. Thanks for the ICE idea......I think I am gonna try that.
hu2dx9,fylgac0,,Where in Phoenix are you located? I'd like to help PM if youd like.
hu2dx9,,fynq4bh,Hey. I am in Raleigh, NC. The article I found when searching for cooling centers - cited some people in AZ. It is bad everywhere. I am so lucky to have the people on this sub. Otherwise I would be totally alone.
hu2dx9,fymtd9h,,I wish that I had a more reasonable solution, but I work at a small county jail in texas and some of our locals have purposely gotten themselves arrested to sit in the jail out of the heat.  Like I said, it's not something I would recommend, just somthing I see every day lately.  Good luck
hu2dx9,,fynpnor,Thank you for the info. It is sad that things have become that desperate for some people. I shouldn't complain. Many have it worse than I do.
hu2dx9,fykhyd3,,Local police may be able to direct you to something. Here they opened one yesterday so that's what I'm going off of.
hu2dx9,,fyls2yt,Homeless people steer clear of police officers in all instances. Sadly, they're often a lot more harmful than helpful.
hu2dx9,,fzo8jv8,Absolute truth right here.
hu2dx9,fykrcmo,,Find a shitty hotel like in town suites chill in the stairwell.  Barnes and noble had some tables out..

Chill wait for mext bus with different driver do the same thing... shift change om bus drivers do it again repeat.... you just got ac all day.
hu2dx9,,fylcugm,She's right... hanging out on a bus during the day might be your best option for the moment. At least they are air conditioned. Its crazy... I'm in LA, its July, and I'm cold half the time, at least at night.   And one way or another, keep drinking water
hu2dx9,,fynqq6a,Thank you for the suggestions. All great ideas.
hu2dx9,fypeuqa,,Dude, listen to your instincts.  If your body says "I'm going to die," it isn't lying to you.  You need to GTFO of Arizona and to a cooler area - get further north & to the coast.  The pandemic is creating a situation where you can get shelter and financial support - use it.
hu2dx9,fyxf9om,,Where exactly in Raleigh are you located? I live in CA, but can definitely send you a GC to any surrounding grocery store.
hu2dx9,,fyz6snr,I think Food Lion sells gift cards. There are other stores - Lidl, Harris Teeter, of course Walmart. Not sure about any of them. Thanks for the offer. The only thing I ever really buy is food from the grocery store. I am in NW Raleigh near the Crabtree Valley Mall.
hu2dx9,,fyzah3p,Are you able to receive mobile gift cards? I can do either Walmart or Target, if you‚Äôd like. Better option for food and general essentials.
hu2dx9,,fyzen0l,sending you a pm.
hsythf,fydi6iy,,I am very sorry for your situation.  You need to be very careful putting a request like that out there.  There are many people that may try to take advantage of you.  There are places that will help minors, especially if you are in a dangerous situation.  Look up youth shelters and call them all until you can speak to someone better able to assist you.  Please do not put yourself in a potentially worse situation by meeting up with a stranger you meet online.  There are professionals that assist people like you.  Please find an appropriate person to get the help you need.  Until then, do not give out any personal information to anyone trying to contact you.  I really fear it could end badly if you do.
hsythf,fydo4xx,,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in a crappy situation. Please don‚Äôt meet with a stranger on the Internet. This is an extremely vulnerable situation and there are sick people that will take advantage of it. Please contact a youth shelter that is near you. Maybe covenant house is an option for you.
hsythf,fydp125,,Do not meet with anyone you meet on the internet.   Google "youth shelter" + \[the name of the nearest city\] and call them.   This is your best chance at getting a safe place to stay.
hsythf,fydq6og,,Youth shelter. Anyone who is going to randomly take in a minor from the internet they don't know is definitely up to some shady business.  Youth shelters will give you room and board with meals.
hsythf,fydtbmr,,Do not do this.  Go to a youth shelter.  Call 211 for help
hsythf,fydvif2,,You are a minor. I highly suggest you call youth services in your area, CPS, the police, fuck even staying at a friends house for a few days until it all blows over are way better options than being homeless.
hsythf,fydwnua,,auntbertha.com  Type in your zip code
hsythf,fye4ckf,,As some others have suggested, I would be very careful asking for something like that on reddit. Be safe, and I hope that you get the help that you need. Good luck!
hsythf,fye3cf5,,In addition to all the great advice offered, let's not forget that Florida is the new COVID-19 epicenter of the **world**. Please wear a mask, wash your hands, try not touch your face and social distance when you can. Whatever problems you have will be made SO MUCH WORSE if you contract the virus.
hsythf,fydtt8r,,If you are unsafe at home, call the police and tell them what is going on. Get into the system, get into a safe place to live that way.
hsythf,fye8wm4,,Shit, dont be shacking up with a stranger. Creeps are fighting amongst themselves right now, over you. Call law enforcement. At least then youll be safe.
hsythf,fye16mj,,You could try Job Corps.  They will give you an education and a place to stay.
hsythf,fydwqr7,,Call the police.
hsythf,fydp65r,,Try the r/assistance subreddit and make a post about your situation in the local as well. Maybe someone can help you.

hqom3q,,fxza5ck,factual.
hqom3q,fy0w798,,As a Finn who's lives in other countries too I can confirm Finland has the least homeless people. Hope this works out and I can be proud of my country.
hqom3q,fxzb256,,The US needs to learn how they did it and follow suit!!!
hqom3q,,fy0f30r,Yes but isolationism is the US foreign policy to this day. There are beautiful things other modern countries have to offer that some of its citizens are aware of but the government and most of it's people are invested in itself in a burrito of soon expiring cultural contents propaganda and self destructive behavior
hqom3q,,fy044tw,There are so many resources out there for us to solve homelessness. Even if the solution isn't perfect I doubt many homeless people would turn their noses at four walls and a roof. As weird as it may sound would it not make sense to have a publicly funded building complex with like three or so buildings depending on the size of the town or city with small rooms that are basically furnished (a bed, a desk, a chair) and a communal bathroom/showers. Just a way for people to get back on their feet really.
hqom3q,,fy678kk,We are a huge country and there's a massive amount of room.  Unfortunate there's an impasse on homelessness, a lot comes from NIMBYs.  Might that come because many homeless want free housing in expensive real estate, San Francisco, Seattle, Venice Beach, Honolulu?  I live just a few minutes outside of a town of 30,000; the outskirts is filled with organic farms, all sorts of people working the land...hippie types...immigrants....locals...retired.   We got a hardcore of 80-100 homeless in town, hanging out at the main park all day and hoping to get free small condos downtown.  Plenty of cabins, plenty of space for them just 15-20 minutes outside of town, if they want to contribute.  Our homeless advocates are particularly outraged that any homeless should be on farms....might be asked to contribute....something about slave labor...demeaning work.
hqom3q,,fy68g03,I am a little up in the air on the issue. I think it's very fair to provide housing and food in exchange for work but you're ultimately generating profits for somebody and earning nothing yourself. I'm a commune kind of guy so if the profits went to the community to provide housing for everyone that's instantly better. I can see both sides tho
hqom3q,,fy6aso4,> but you're ultimately generating profits for somebody and earning nothing yourself.  That is a fair criticism of virtually every job their is -- except working the land on your own.  No boss, no oppressive supervisor, no OSHA, no discussion  of fight for $15....food is sold in farmers markets at market prices so you can't complain....profit is what profit is.... little discussion of hostile or biased working environment.  Self sufficiency is how people lived for all of human history...a lot of food grown goes into your mouth or is bartered.  Some people even categorize farm labor more as *living* than working.  (this is a whole different lifestyle than people working giant agribusiness engaged in difficult stoop labor picking cabbage next to 100 migrant workers)  True the homeless wouldn't initially have their own land for free, in most cases. I just like to bring this topic up because it is a broad counterpoint to anti-capitalist views on labor and those views are often linked to the plight of the homeless.  I suspect that in some cases, municipalities would even given homeless land for free, say a lease of $1 per year, pitch a tent until social service programs can help fund a small cabin; they can often be built for only about $2,000.  I agree there are obstacles, but it seems this area gets so little discussion...unfortunate...we've had our small 4 acre farm for 25 years...real neat lifestyle...
hqom3q,,fy6bbi3,Seems real cool. When I was homeless I wished there were opportunities to work on a farm.
hqom3q,,fy6d2ow,Great viewpoint.  Wish more people were open to it.  I never even went there until about age 40, was a white collar guy living in a city...it was eye-opening...and I got to like physical labor... 4 - 5 hours a day (not 8) broken up by a 2-3 hour lunch break is good (I think  people down south invented the siesta!)
hqom3q,fy6lm8l,,Finland has really been leading the way for at least the last decade.   I have a Finnish friend who works helping to house homeless people. And the amount of support, resources, and help they give to each homeless person is pretty amazing.   Rest of the world can learn a lot from Finland.

hoyfib,fxkt0vq,,Instead of worrying about helping others, you should just relax for two nights on your own. If you can get 48 hours of peace, just take it.    Opening it up to others is a noble thing but there's no shame in taking care of yourself first, *especially* if that was the intent of the person helping you.   Some of the most generous people I've ever known are those without homes or those in challenging living situations, but unfortunately that generosity hinders them. I'm not saying be an asshole, but don't feel bad staying in a hotel room for two nights by yourself without sharing it with strangers.
hoyfib,,fxktkwd,Oh, I don't feel bad staying by myself.  I love alone time.  Just thought I'd put the offer out there.  It's hot as shit with a brutal sun.
hoyfib,,fxkv41c,People up under the bridge used to come round and ask, got a dollar, a smoke and a light, drink of water? I had these things because I was in a better earning place than most of the denizens under overpass hotel.  I'd say, "I got hardly anything but I'll gladly share it with you."  When you got nothing you got nothing to lose. There are no expectations in nothingville. The hardest thing I had to learn to accept was having nothing and being happy anyway.
hoyfib,,fxkvxxz,Yeah I think that's great. If you had a hotel room for two nights would ya put an open invite for people to join you?   I think kindness can blur what is smart and what opens you up to risk, which was the point I probably didn't make well.
hoyfib,,fxkwin2,I think its noble of you. I did that before.. It was Christmas, cold out, my Mom bought me a hotel room overnight so I could get cleaned up to go to christmas next day with family (the irony).  I invited a friend to spend the night too, what the hell. But I knew him. Be nice, but also be careful.
hoyfib,,fxl0k6l,Formerly homeless here.  Been staying in motel rooms for almost four months about to get an apartment and I've only spent four nights by myself.  I generally host 1-3 of my friends and friends of friends that are both women and men.  Make sure they can get a shower, something to eat and a comfortable place to sleep.     Each has been extremely grateful for the relative normalness that a night or three off the streets or out of a shelter provides them.
hoyfib,,fxl19zf,Absolutely, a place to let your guard down, get warm, sleep peaceful.   Like RnR from the combat of the streets. I remember that feeling. Even if only for a night or two.
hoyfib,,fxl2fip,Yeah, I believe that "the let your guard down" because they're in a place with people they trust means a lot to many of them because each knows me to varying degrees and can sleep better.  I know that almost all still have a small measure of guard up just because that feeling won't leave them for months or years after homelessness.
hoyfib,,fxnmx7k,Yah. Took me a long time to come 'indoors'. Part of me hates that I'm domesticated now, gone soft, dependent on the system and my 'creature comforts'.
hoyfib,,fxl90zf,yep

hozbb3,fxkzi2k,,You can get good, heavy bread cheap 2nd day or the 'oops, made too much' cart. A loaf of good bread gives you a base for a meal - useful, and $2/ea. Honestly? People on the street need hand sanitizer right now. You can buy food with SNAP, but nothing other than food. Sanitizer is wanted.
hozbb3,fxnmmzh,,More important - alcohol or sanitizer or Lysol or disinfectant. I say this because without running water - let alone hot water - and/or soap, and all of these things always sold-out and gone from every place - it is impossible to not constantly be at risk of the Corona virus. On top of that, it is usually a bad idea to accept mystery food from people you don't know.

ho1jbz,fzaozl3,,You still looking?
ho1jbz,,g1qelf5,I‚Äôm looking again actually. We ended up getting a roommate and we lost most of our money in the move. She was getting crazy violent so we had to move back in with my mom so we can‚Äôt stay here long. Our budget is now around $1,200 if everything is included
ho1jbz,,g1vw044,I'm sorry to hear that, roommate problems suck.  If she was being violent a restraining order could have removed her leaving you to find a roommate for her room.  But what's done is done.   I'm sorry I don't have any availability at this time.
ho1jbz,,g1vwanb,We weren‚Äôt even on the lease. The landlord had no idea we lived there. I found that out when we bumped into her when we left :/ and I know the roommate would retaliate. She‚Äôs friends with some very dangerous people so it wasn‚Äôt worth risking our lives over so we just had to do what we had to do. Thank you for your kindness, I really appreciate it ‚ô•Ô∏è
ho1jbz,,g1vxoxw,Gotcha.  Good luck.   If you have the cash and the job to show for it, and transportation (car), I imagine there's quite a few desperate landlords south of the city, like, Rhode Island.   I used to have property in Woonsocket and I could not find decent tenants.   Somebody who has a job and a car I would have loved to have at $700 for a whole apartment a few years back.  Places like Fall River and what not are probably similar.
ho1jbz,,g1zvl0k,Thank you! We were actually looking a bit in Rhode Island. A lot of people told us to check it out so if we don‚Äôt have any luck then we will for sure look down there

hj071q,fwjqeaa,,I have one of these and I can say it isn't as practical as one would think. Setup is super easy, but the sheer size of it when folded would be the hard part. It's not light and super awkward to carry around, I'm not with it now but iirc it's about 4 feet tall and 3 feet wide carrying case. In my opinion a decent hammock with rain fly/tarp and string is more practical.
hj071q,,fwkzcp9,Definitely hammock+tarp or bivy+tarp.
hj071q,fwjllds,,That looks like a lot of poles and stuff to carry... Perhaps if one had a car or a storage space? Even then. Eeeeh. :(  I still say the safest way to sleep outside is on the ground atop cardboard or a camping mat, under an appropriately colored tarp both for camouflage and to ward off rain. It way more likely you'll be spotted and asked to move(or worse) if you're rocking a tent or anything with a high and/or bright profile.  To each their own though.
hj071q,fwjdqwo,,Does it have a floor in there? I like how it's off the ground which is great.
hj071q,,fwjplkr,[deleted]
hj071q,,fwjqwxb,That would just be to sleep only?
hj071q,,fwk3p5x,You could put whatever stuff will fit inside with you, there may be some pockets depending on which one you have/get. Some have storage underneath but it's probably not too resistant to thieves or animals.
hj071q,fwjg1cs,,Definitely get it
hj071q,fwjvd1a,,Budget, climate, location & profile of shelter are usually my primary criteria. In the case of this tent cot, it's a bit overt & likely heavy for my area/needs. As with many things, when it comes to survival there isn't a perfect solution for everything. Especially if cost is a factor. As we're discussing pre-made shelters, I'm going to assume the criteria involves some type of budget. Free/improvised shelters won't be addressed in this response as it's outside of the OP's topic IMHO.   In my case, the homeless situation was a bit premeditated on my part. I had the budget, so I kinda splurged on shelter. A Litefighter 1S, and a Amok Draumr. A tent & hammock respectively. Neither are cheap, but in comparison to housing in a HCOL area, I could justify it. Both weigh in around 5lbs with rainfly & sleeping pad. The 1S is pretreated with permethrin, a good DEET insecticide alternative. You can treat any article of gear/clothing with it as well. Highly recommended for buggy areas and if you're not overly sensitive to insecticides.  My tent is pretty low key in terms of dimensions, I don't recall the exact numbers but I'd guess 36"Hx32"Wx96"L. I'm in and around a state capitol, so keeping a low profile is high on my list of priorities. If you're in a low population or low traffic area, a setup that's more ostentatious or expansive in footprint might be completely practical.    If I ended up in a place with BLM land or make some type of arrangements with a property owner (I.E. I could be there somewhat legally), I'd opt for a hammock over a tent. They're typically lighter, pack down smaller, and are (matter of preference) more comfortable than ground based options. Weather & high profile are the chief issues IMO. There are sub 20¬∞F options for hammock camping, but they're not exactly affordable.   Get a sleeping pad rated for your climate if you can.  If budget is tight/nonexistent, check surplus stores, goodwill, Salvation Army, or local FB classifieds for some type of shelter. Even a $5 tarp is better than nothing. Improvise the tent stakes & cordage. A ground mat out of cardboard, plastic bags, and tape can turn into a passable, somewhat water resistant, option. Kinda bulky, but if you're clever you can design it to fold down into reasonable dimensions. Cheap doubled up yoga mats can work too if your climate isn't rough.   If your in a cold climate, make sure you do everything you can to effect some type of ground insulation. Hat, scarf, and decent dry socks are critical. Hygiene is important beyond the aspect of comfort or social interaction. Keep your extremities as dry & warm as possible. Especially the feet. Tend to any chafing or hot spots ASAP. Your legs are your transportation, and you'll be in a worse place if you're hobbled, and have a fungal infection.   Heat/humidity sucks, the cold is lethal.
hj071q,fwju6vb,,Too bulky. Lighten up
hj071q,fwk2c10,,Big, sort of heavy. If you'll be largely stationary, these are great. If you'll be moving around a lot, try to get a hammock tent or just pair a parachute fabric hammock with a lightweight tarp.   You're not going to hide that thing in a backpack when you're thinking about camping somewhere you may not entirely supposed to be.
hj071q,fwk356c,,I found cots to be horribly uncomfortable, and inflatable mattresses to be unreliable. The cooler air of the wee hours would cause the mattress to deflate.   There are these thin inflatable things that are more like an air pad, and they won't deflate on you. I learned to use those, plus those half inch thick blue foam things, and a couple thick folded blankets under it. I put my sleeping bag on top of all that. That was the best homeless camp sleep I had.   The cots always had me pressed up against the aluminum frame on one side. I could only sleep if really tired. If you're built slender enough, it might not affect you the same.
hj071q,fwood0u,,The only two relevant questions make this option no longer viable.  1. How much does this cost?  2. What are the dimensions?
hj071q,fwjqw9u,,If it is something you can transport easily, I would get it, you could safely insulate it from cold and set up a little propane heater *OUTSIDE *, and put a little cover a few feet up to direct the heat. I had a big box I could set up my heater outside the truck, in an Alaskan winter. If you have to hide it, you have a chance of losing it.
hj071q,fwm2pfz,,This will be very difficult to carry all day long and it stands out attached to the pack and stands out when it is set up.  What does it cost?  A dark colored hammock with built in mosquito netting and a camouflage tarp over it for rain protection is light weight and concealable.  Or you can go to ground with the tarp and some cardboard under you for insulation and cushion. Think like a fold over sandwich or a taco with the hobo as the filling. [Tarp](https://rollingfox.com/how-to-make-a-tarp-tent-with-designs) can be pitched low in A frame mode or flying wedge for storm protection.  Concealment from view is paramount and being able to blend into the muggle world without carrying a mountaineering back pack is prefered.

hibyke,fwfetll,,Its why I check before I provide :)
hibyke,,fwff4ht,You're a smart one my man! Btw I was able to get a real good pair of sauconys and still had enough for dinner for the rest of the week lol

hibyke,,fwf9kqw,Okay just making sure I'm not being petty
hibyke,fwfhgqo,,i 100% agree its spitting in the eye of people that really need help and people that are kind enough to help
hibyke,,fwg70b9,I posted earlier this month that my girlfriend and I went to the soup kitchen, food bank, women's shelter (for her lady stuff) and the free daily meals for showers and laundry and food all winter and every Tuesday and Thursday we'd see some bitch with a Mercedes and an iPhone getting bags and bags for herself. New shirts and gloves and blankets and chapstick and so much food. Never saw her at the warming or overnight shelter, though. I said before I know that everyone's situation is different but, seriously, what the fuck even is that?
hibyke,,fwghyic,Entitlement. They are above everyone, believe rules don't apply to them.
hibyke,fwfmhcv,,Yeah, sometimes I wonder if people don't realize others can see their post history.  There's been a few times where someone has different stories or whatever going on in different subs.  Come on dude, we all see what you're saying.
hibyke,,fwg919k,That‚Äôs funny I‚Äôm not so funny way, like they‚Äôre playing parts in a play. Which is the real them? Sounds like scamming people. Someone who doesn‚Äôt know what truth is.
hibyke,fwfllz8,,A lot of times I would agree but sometimes people like to hold onto or buy one or two things to make them feel "normal". I've worked with clients that own expensive guitars because that's their only connection to the non homeless world so to speak. Sure, they could sell them but it's not going to substantially change their situation in any tangible way, and they keep these things because they have nothing else really that's just for them. If they're continuously buying expensive things or have huge collections though that's a different story.
hibyke,,fwfrf48,And it‚Äôs fine to be poor and have nice things, that‚Äôs a personal choice. But being dumb af with your money & then begging from strangers on the internet is gross

hibyke,fwg7k7m,,Meh screw it, times are hard. If anyone is homeless but still has an actual set of Yeezys I'll send ya a giftcard.

hibyke,fwg9f4z,,I‚Äôm curious who that is
hibyke,,fwkcw4g,Some chick on assistance who obviously didnt know we could see their history  :]
hibyke,,fwkqq25,Oh ok
hibyke,fwfzb43,,Too many people, too many kids, are lazy and spoiled as fuck. People want to take and take but don't want to work for it. You know how I got my job? Because when the restaurant re-opened after this Covid shit, half of their employees decided they weren't "ready" to come back to work. They'd rather sit on their asses and get their unemployment for a couple more months, because hey, why not? Its free money. Easier to sleep in, drink, get high, fuck around, and not have to worry about breaking a sweat for it. 6 employees decided not to come back now, so for me, it created a job opening.   It shows you just how shallow so many segments of our society is.
hibyke,,fwgt6ww,Some of them might be afraid of getting sick.. there still is a pandemic..? Our cases are still going on. 9k new cases just in Florida. They may not want to risk the incredible hospital bills, and not to mention some people are so underpaid they are making more on unemployment. But I wouldn‚Äôt go out either until the vaccine was widely available or cases are at a small stable amount here...
hibyke,,fwgzbrj,I‚Äôm sorry but how is that shallow? A lot of them are probably actually making more right now than they would going into work. How is that lazy?? How is it shallow to choose what‚Äôs making you more money and let‚Äôs you spend time with your family, than to expose yourself to a dangerous virus in order to make profits for someone else?
hibyke,,fwh7u5s,It‚Äôs called Work Ethic, which Is lacking sorely these days. It‚Äôs not about the employer and how much they are profiting. Don‚Äôt like your job, you change it. It‚Äôs about being responsible to ones self.  It‚Äôs about feeling like you‚Äôre  earning your keep, adding value to society one lives in, securing yourself to some anchor. I bet many of those people who don‚Äôt work aren‚Äôt doing it because of the virus, but rather they can get easy money. They rather get unemployment, and yes more money possibly than work.  But I also, bet, many of those people aren‚Äôt sitting at home to avoid the virus, but hanging out with friends and family, going to places without masks, spending that unemployment money like it‚Äôs a holiday. You think they're sitting at home and going out only when it‚Äôs essential? You think they‚Äôre  saving most of that Unemployment money because they‚Äôre avoiding going out or buy toys because of the virus. But guess what, when that unemployment runs out, look how fast they‚Äôll be begging for any job. A lot of people operate from A standpoint  of desperation. They‚Äôll panic, and only think about the truly important things at the last hour. I‚Äôve gotten unemployment a few times in the past, but there is always an end. Many People who have jobs to go back to, but rather get unemployment, I believe are lacking worth ethic and are shortsighted. Not saying there aren‚Äôt some that are afraid of the virus, but a lot of people rather have free money, except the problem is there is no such thing as free money, someone is always paying for those free things. It takes a strong mind and moral character to do the right thing. Usually taught from a young age, but sometimes people have it inherently. We all have the propensity to take the easy way out, short cuts. It‚Äôs a lot easier, like the looters prove, just to take things.
hibyke,,fwhcnow,>You think they're sitting at home and going out only when it‚Äôs essential?   Yeah I do.
hhw6uy,fwcxqjn,,Looks like you just spent a whole lot of time writing something that ultimately helps no one and changes no one's opinions. Hope you learn to let things go when you can't do anything to change it, don't let negative shit take so much space in your head. Good luck out there.
hibjbh,fwgkj04,,All I can come up with is to invite over their minister late one night. Explain the problem to the minister first. You can always say you did that because you were interested in joining the church. Lol
hibjbh,,fwiupvt,The year is 2020 and the concept of a universal fridge has yet to exist.

hibjbh,fwlya80,,I went through the same shit with my dad. Catholic though. I just kept my head down, went to college, and never spoke to him ever again. Maybe try to save up a little bit of money until you can leave? I'm sorry you're going through that.
hibjbh,fwxsdhp,,How old are you? Even if under 18 and it's time to start making plans to get out. Get your own bank account then find a job. Put your money into your own bank account that your family cannot access. Keep your head down don't disagree don't get into arguments just work and save your money and plan to get out.
hibjbh,fyx7tri,,That doesn't sound very Christian to me. Have a chat with their minister
hhagvo,fw9u06h,,Glad a doctor came in this sub today and thank you.
hhagvo,fw9m2s3,,I have not been able to see any doctor, get any medical care, not been able to get any of the many screenings - skin cancer, colon cancer, regular check-up, blood tests, etc.....nor have I been able to see a dentist in many years. Part of the problem is some states (and the current national government administration) have refused to expand Medicaid. I live in NC where the legislature has prevented it. I keep hearing about these clinics, but every time I visit any of  their websites, the information I see makes it sound like I am going to have to pay more than I  would be able to - and even if I can't, I would be getting in debt for a long time. I have considered "moving" (I am homeless, after all) 55 miles north to Virginia but don't know how that would work with proof of residency, needing an address, etc...
hhagvo,,fw9y106,Yeah. There's no help in this state for us. Maybe we can thump out illness with a bible. That's what our legislators believe.
hhagvo,,fw9ykd7,A big part of the reason I am homeless is because I spent my life-savings on health insurance premiums. Health insurance that I could never use anyway because the deductible was still so high, I couldn't even think about going to the doctor anyway. This country's health care system is so fucked-up it is beyond belief.
hhagvo,,fwapbu6,I wholly agree. I vote against those types but they always wind up winning. Currently in a very conservative county with terrible healthcare access. I'm relocating out West soon as the quarantines are over - if they ever are.
hhagvo,,fw9utit,This struggle is real!!!!
hhagvo,,fy38sbu,NC here too. This state sucks!
hhagvo,fwa9xne,,Thank you so much. I'm waiting for medicaid to get awarded and ran out of thyroid pills!
hhagvo,fwai89a,,This is good to know. However, the only clinic near me is absolutely awful ‚Äî I've been there before, and they were extremely unhelpful and patronizing each time, no matter which doctor I went to (there are only two). Going there puts me at more risk than not going anywhere. So, I guess until I can get out of this area, I'm stuck.
hhagvo,,fwbbc1f,I'm always sorry to hear it when someone is not treated with respect at a clinic. Unfortunately, doctors are people too, and that means sometimes they are dicks.
hhagvo,,fwbhc8e,The system is broken. No one is creating meaningful change. So crappy people can't be held accountable, and those on the bottom rung in particular are stuck with them because we have no resources to access other options. And no one gives a crap enough to change it.
hhagvo,,fwashfl,Where is your area? Maybe something to avoid.
hhagvo,,fwav3zu,Central Missouri. I don't really want to get more specific than that.  *Edit:* I can tell you that the clinic in question is called Katy Trail, as there are many of them spread over a wide area.
hhagvo,,fwawmf3,Okay. Not near me.
hhagvo,fw9ky8n,,Thank you for reaching out. This is a great resource. This is also great to reshare.
hhagvo,fw9oww3,,Thank you for this.
hhagvo,fwaawku,,It's been years since I had medical care. I had to go to another state and I now have Medicaid. Unfortunately being homeless you are unable to take care of yourself and I have found out about my medical problems. If I had proper health care, then I would not be going through what I am going through now.
hhagvo,fwemibr,,Access to high quality primary, and preventative care for the homeless population is critical.  I see the consequences every day that people have to suffer due to lapses in treatment of otherwise treatable conditions. Eg, Diabetes. Particularly resulting  in seizures, and chronic issues with gangrene, resulting in frequent and repeated ER trips, hospital stays, surgery.  People tragically  confined to a wheelchair as a result, and often relativity young people in need of intensive assisted living care.  It is critical that not only do the homeless population have access to quality healthcare.  There needs to be significant outreach, and a high level of care, and healthcare case management needs to be brought to them.    Much of the population is that is most vulnerable doesn't have the wherewithal  to see to it they get care themselves.  Really the cost of not doing so is not only tragic, and needless suffering. But sharply increased healthcare  cost to society in terms of use of emergency services, and chronic ER, and hospital use as a result of unmanaged but highly treatable illness.    First rate healthcare access for the most vulnerable in society is prevention for everyone, and frees up emergency resources for all   Further when people end up so several disabled from un managed health conditions, they need to be housed in expensive assisted living, rather than  more cost effective  mainstream affordable housing, or permanently supportive housing situations.
hhagvo,fwbazg7,,I know for sure that anyone in San Francisco can get free insurance through the city as long as they say they are dwelling there. So just say you are sleeping in GG Park or something, and make sure you don't have an ID with an address outside the city on you when you go in. Otherwise you will go through the medical process, which is a little more difficult. I mean, just get on some form of medicaid if you can, but I get it. It's really hard to do all the administrative stuff, even for someone with a permanent mailing address and all that.
hga1tt,fw3bqne,,Shoes and socks are the most important gear for homeless. When I was homeless we figured out that it is about a 4 to 1 ratio. Every day of wear and tear on your shoes, socks, feet and legs, is like 4 for a normal person.
hga1tt,,fw3ccoy,wow I never knew that. non wounded I'm having these problem. Since  A: I'll always walk everywhere I go. no one would ever offer me drive eveing when I offer money.  I'll legit walk 30 mineut as a teen to go to school everyday.  then 2 to 3 year of being homeless  I'm a street performer whit the guitar so I'm always on my feet for that. hitchhike acrosse canada whit torn shoe.  yup starting to make sence now.
hga1tt,fw312b9,,You can get store-brand foam insoles for about $1 at many places, and I think they're softer and more comfortable than gel ones. That can help a lot. So can thick socks.
hga1tt,,fw4tx9c,I buy 99cent flip flops from Dollar Tree, take the the straps off and stick with shoes one size too big. I've found NOTHING that compares. They also help in winter for cushioning from the ground. Also, if some moisture gets into your shoes..it stays at the bottom, underneath the inserts, protecting your feet unless your shoes are completely submerged.
hga1tt,fw2yuc0,,As far as tennis shoes go I find Adidas hold up well under street conditions but if you carry a heavy backpack nothing beats a good pair of redwing boots. I currently have both I use the Adidas for camp moccasins and the redwings whenever I leave camp. Even the Adidas will get destroyed after 6 months of heavy usage unless you're light weight. I weigh 100kg and when I was on foot I carried about 30kg in my backpack that's a total of 290lbs and any shoes that weren't Adidas wouldn't last more than 3 months. Even a good pair of boots would only last me about 14 months. Now that I'm homeless on an ebike my shoes last alot longer and I can carry more gear with my trailer. Tea tree oil will wipeout boot rot and swampass. Take care of your feet it is your life out here.
hga1tt,,fw378ua,thank man feet thing anit going so well do. no docter belived me since their no actually sign of a problem physically   and since I'm bpd they thing I'm likey making it up for attention.
hga1tt,,fw5t6b6,This country's health care system is so screwed up that you have to do some John Q shit to get anything done.
hga1tt,fw4aki8,,My life changed drastically for the better once I got a bike. I was really lucky though and found some money and just happened to run into someone who offered to sell me their bike for ten dollars. If it was an hour or so later that money would have been spent on drugs
hga1tt,fw3cs0q,,Used to work for a podiatrist, more often than not people are wearing shoes which are either too short or too narrow for their feet which will heavily contribute to foot problems. Making certain your shoes are big enough is essential to preventing or at least slowing down things like pinched nerves, bunions, callus formations, blisters, etc.
hga1tt,,fw3dp6l,is felling like rock are under your feet a pinch nerve?  See my main issus is i have no physical swelling happing at my foot you look at my feet you thing their nothing wrong.     And cause of that im having so much trouble, cause of the no physical sign. Hospital told me to call the walk in clint and not come back. It was irresponsible for me to go. Ill called the walkin clint cause their nerve pill anit working anymore and their like well what u want us to do.     Like im on fucking reddit talking to random stranger for advince that how despreted i am. cause monday i start a job. A fucking real job. That require me to be on my feet all shift long and since their short staff i can expect to do well over 8 a day.
hga1tt,,fw3t8x6,Do you get that feeling when you first walk in the morning?  Does it improve if you are walking during the day or does it get worse?  Where in your foot does it hurt most?  Is it in heel area or where?
hga1tt,,fw3xanr,When i first wake up (8 to 9) in the morning is legit the only time it gone. then around 10am i start getting a tingling felling between my toes.     This can be any between my big and second or between my 3rd or 4th toe   Since i been on nephropathy pills the tingling when away but it coming back now.   I can deal whit it.     It the twitch and weird almost pains. sometime where i my joint for 3rd toes. when pressure it fell like it about to cave in sort of deal.     Sometime and this is the big one. I get a pressure sort to say. on my 4th toe. and it will make a ring. I know it fucking weird. Then give a strong shape pain. It the worst fell like that toe curl upward whit all the pain associated to that but, it my their toe, that legit twitching back and forte.     That what cause this in the first place now i keep getting those warning sign all the time and im scared all the time it gonna happens again.     I dont know if you know what that like, always scared that the thing that bring you around can hurt at any time for no reasons.     Usually by the time i go to bed, it at it worst but i take my med go to bed.     Obviously walking around make it worst but being at my grandparent whit my grandfather thing im full of shit. That a hole other story whiting it self. make me walk around quick a bit and help him whit his stuff.      Anyway you get the picture, i be honest im quite frustrated and notice if i get angry or any intense emotion it make it worst.     trow in im BPD so intense emotion are pretty well life well.     I wrote yhis out in good detail to help me explaining it to my docter btw.
hga1tt,,fw3xss0,Oh and both feet do this, too much of a coincidence for me to have fuck over the same nerve in both feet i have werid back pain i guess. it not a pain it more of a annoyance that keep coming back and forte for years.      In no doctor but if i was a betting man. Witch im not, i put my money on that the real problem.
hga1tt,,fw423x5,I had hoped I would be able to offer tips as I suffered from plantar fasciitis in the past however my issue was obviously completely different. I do hope you can get some relief soon as the inability to walk makes everything ridiculously hard. I feel for you.  If you could see a podiatrist that may be of help, I live in Australia and you can go to a hospital to see Doctors, podiatrists etc.  In the meantime meticulous hygiene is imperative, keep your toenails cut straight and short, wear fitting shoes, take multivitamins. Can you massage your toes at night or during the day?  Does massaging help at all?  Maybe you could Google pressure points for nerve compression. Goodluck mate, hope it improves quickly.
hga1tt,fw2xfp4,,Its the fact that the shoe was built for cushion that makes it bad when the cushion breaks down. Buy flat hard rubber shoes (like converse) and you will never have this problem. You might have to slowly get used to walking in them if youve used arch support for years.
hga1tt,,fw3l53v,My foot doesn't even fit in converse.
hga1tt,,fw3pdvm,Converse was just an example. Redwing shoes were mentioned in another comment. A lot of boots have hard rubber soles, but you might not necessarily want to wear boots all the time. There are lots of great sandle options if you like sandals.
hga1tt,,fw5vvqo,Yeah, I wear a DSG sandal with sand socks, due to having weird feet. Thanks for the tip.
hga1tt,,fw3836z,kinda hard when I legit camt walk for more then 3 mineut rn.
hgi1v7,fw42vni,,You are going to find that no pain killers work for sciatica. Steroids help, and anti inflammatory meds help a bit. Pain killers are worthless. Exercises that are targeted to the sciatic nerve will be more valuable than anything else in the long term.   Source: have had sciatica for 30 years.
hgi1v7,,fw5kl5q,And even if pain killers worked, I‚Äôm guessing the ER docs aren‚Äôt going to give them to OP if they feel it‚Äôs drug-seeking behavior and/or has a history of going to the ER for pain killers/muscle relaxers.  Also, if they ran any bloodwork, which I‚Äôm sure they did, they would‚Äôve already noticed the opioids in OP‚Äôs system from heroin and they‚Äôre definitely not going to prescribe any controlled prescriptions after that.
hgi1v7,fw5u3oe,,That happened to me a couple of months ago after sleeping wrong. It took all my will and 10 minutes to get up. I've often thought that if I really need some medical attention and at the point of no fks given  that I would stand on an overpass on a busy highway during rush hour. Then explain my situation to the cops and let them Baker act me. If they don't resolve the issue then back to the overpass again and again until they do something about it.
hgi1v7,,fw7tvm4,How long till it went away
hgi1v7,,fw7uicz,About 3 days.
hgi1v7,fw6bp6b,,I am not a doctor or even much  on  medical knowledge...however.....hello ...here's everything I know about this. I am a 62 year old homeless man who has healed from a pretty bad case of sciatica...at age 25 i lifted something improperly and crushed a disc on the  right side...i saw a chiropractor who advised me to:   mega dose vitamin c   6-8000 mg per day....sleep flat on my back without a pillow.....use cold pack or ice for a couple of weeks then switch to heat only when healing begins........the sleeping thing was the most difficult thing for me but I just sort of willed myself  to do it  ....i also had some people to help me get up off the floor (plywood) i slept  on...I hope any of this helps...i wish you health..strength and peace...maybe check the vitamin c thing with someone who knows more about it?

hen0sk,fvt8282,,I'm sorry man.  I've had this happen over and over over again.  I started splitting up my stuff and hiding it in several different spots so that if I lost one stash I didn't lose everything. Try to accumulate multiples of necessities and hide them in different in different locations because when it's winter and you lose your blanket it's sucks really bad and can even be deadly depending on your region  Edit: I'm not sure what your situation is but dumpster diving can be beneficial depending what area your in. Try big chain stores and middle class areas if you can.  That shit saved my life
hen0sk,fvtmfzk,,After my parents became homeless they lost their storage unit. Well all of our sentimental items had to get hauled out by the street and as they slept people came by and rummaged through everything and stole what they could. They took my dead brothers baby photos. The only thing my mom had left of him. Gone.
hen0sk,,fvtsfzf,This happened to me. Everything. Absolutely everything. I'm still not over it. I don't feel as if I'm a person anymore, from before my birth, 3 generations, until my youngest was 18, gone. I feel your pain my friend. Tell your mother you love her. The guilt is insanity.
hen0sk,,fvtssyq,My family has lost all of our personal memorabilia... all my school books, baby photos..I completely broke down when I was with my girlfriend as she was going down memory lane with all of her families keepsakes. Many things I remembered I used to have... I love my parents very much and it hurts so bad to see them struggling on the streets. I feel so guilty I had a couch to sleep on and get on my feet and I just hope I can help bring them back..  You are a person. You do matter. It's not your fault. Stay strong. A quote I like to share... "in the midst of winter, I find within myself, an invincible summer." Albert Camus. Find your summer. It's in there.
hen0sk,,fvu3z27,I am familiar with that quote and love that it made smile reading it.  Photos of my grandparents, baby pics, art, furniture, so many things, down to silliness like a favorite mug, a sweater, it's overwhelming even to write this right now. I can't ever imagine how one can work in a profession such as that. impossible
hen0sk,,fvuauow,God, that quote rocked me to my core this morning.
hen0sk,fvsd757,,Yep. Did the exact same had the exact same thing happen. Lost about $500 in gear and some personal momentos.   So I feel you brother.
hen0sk,,fvsdkra,One of the things in that case was a pair of jeans I was customizing whenever I had free time. I know it sounds silly but it was one of the few things keeping my head up. Having my own little creation that I would watch grow throughout these miserable days. And now it‚Äôs gone. Fuck.
hen0sk,fvsvi4a,,Shit like this happens all the time, brother. You live, you learn. At least no money or expensive items were stolen. You'll get new clothes, no problem. You'll be customizing another pair of jeans before you know it. If I were near you I'd help you out, but I'm too far south.
hen0sk,,fvsw5p6,Thank you. One thing I am very grateful for in this situation is that all of my electronics were in my backpack rather than the suitcase, entirely by chance. I am very fortunate to have only lost clothing. It also helps a ton knowing that there are others out there who feel exactly what I‚Äôm going though. I‚Äôll keep my head up and keep counting my blessings.
hen0sk,,fvswm56,For sure brother. We need bad times to make sure we recognize the good times. Stay safe out there, friend. Be well.
hen0sk,,fwoj3bg,When you‚Äôre homeless your clothes is infinitely more important than your electronics...  priorities...  now you should sell your electronics and find a goodwill or Salvation Army to buy more clothes...
hen0sk,fvshea8,,That totally stinks. Sorry to hear.  Keep your head up. Homelessness is one of the most challenging things in life to dig oneself out of.  I hope you still have your ID at the very least.  Best of wishes. Rooting for you.
hen0sk,fvtezkj,,Its happened to me too. You just learn to get more creative in your hiding. It sucks, but all you can do for now is just roll with the punches.
hen0sk,fvtsna0,,I bury everything. And roofs. It's summer time. Go up on any parking structures and look around at apartment complexes' roofs. I spent a month sleeping on a beautiful roof end of last summer.  I buried my bike at night. Yes, I buried my bike so I could sleep at night
hen0sk,fvubehz,,The very, very, very first thing I did before anything else was rent a storage unit. It's, like, $85 or so a month, but they do definitely have smaller ones. Mine is definitely the size of a jail cell, and I do occasionally go sit in there during the day to get out of the rain/heat, but not for very long, as they DEFINITELY have auditors (source: am an auditor!), looking for folks sleeping in units. Folks make that stupid suggestion to me all the time, and I would legit die in a metal, jail cell in the Florida heat. I have no clue how I'm gonna pay it next month, as I don't get paid til next, next Friday. When my twin was homeless, she got all her stuff stolen too, including her car. I'm not sure why folks treat us like the scum of the earth.
hen0sk,fvt9j8r,,check the closest lost and found?
hen0sk,,fvt9pob,I had done this as well as just about every other option I could think of long before posting this. Thank you for the suggestion though, even the little things mean a lot.
hen0sk,,fvtlnqy,Excuse my ignorance but doesn‚Äôt Good Will give out clothes?  Also, if you put an ad on craigs list in the ‚Äú wanted to buy‚Äù someone might answer with free clothes.
hen0sk,,fvu62lv,As far as I know, Good Will doesn't give out anything. They are there for people to buy whatever is in their store. From what I read awhile back, Good Will is more about lining the bigwigs pockets. I do not shop there nor do I donate to them. Salvation Army is a better option if there is one in your area.
hen0sk,,fvuax7e,Isn't Salvation Army doing the exact same shit though?
hen0sk,,fvugn8r,Salvation Army has stores as well, but they actually help people in need. Not directly from the stores, though. In my area (south Florida), they have a central hub where  they give food to people in need. I believe they also have a shelter. Not sure what else they provide.   My previous comment is based on an article I read about how the corporate people in charge use the proceeds. Goodwill was at the top of the list for being least helpful.
hen0sk,,fvv3wwp,Good Will and Salvation Army have been known to do some shady shit.    If dude is desperate, I see no moral qualm from liberating some clothes.
hen0sk,fvsco0o,,Sorry about that. Where are located?
hen0sk,,fvscp42,Currently in Carrollton texas
hen0sk,,fvtgajf,Not close. Me in s. Calif.
hen0sk,,fwixkmt,Hey I sent you a DM! I'd like to help if I can.
hen0sk,fvv4edn,,Lesson learned. Pack light. Pack tight.  I recommend investing in tough clothing that you can wash daily/often. So you can reduce how much clothing you need.   Before corona I was wearing only 2 outfits. Constantly handwashing one of them daily. I only got smell complaints on the days where I skipped on the washing. It was pretty comfy.
hen0sk,fvuidww,,When you're homeless on foot you can only count on keeping what you carry.
hen0sk,fvvtjhc,,Do you still have your ID?
he1k68,fvot2in,,You can get sleeping mats for free from construction site trash. Get the bubble wrap that is covered in shiny mylar  used for insulation. It's lighter than a sleeping mat and alot warmer. Most people who have been homeless more than 2 years and camp in the woods know this stuff. Your advice is more for greenhorns. And to the green people out there this is a good compilation of camping tips. Though few things in life are as miserable as being swarmed by 90,000 mosquitoes and if you have just a tarp you will wish you had a tent or a good bivy.
he1k68,,fvpu754,Thanks for the feedback.  Great tip about the bubble wrap.  Yeah, my goal was more focused on helping greenhorns, but I'd be happy to have more advanced or in-depth discussions any old heads out there too.  I often learn a new tip or trick from reading forums and Youtube videos even after all my experience--not to mention there are plenty of way more experienced backpackers out there too.  And yeah, getting swarmed by mosquitoes and not having any protection is the worst.  But I've had friends buy cheapo (like 15 bucks) festival tents and combine them with a plastic tarp over them and it's worked surprisingly well.  You can also modify and cut off stuff on cheapo tents to make them lighter and less bulky.  Happy trails to you.
he1k68,,fvqmtti,That's how I roll. Scout tent from Walmart and a 10x12 tarp. Last winter I managed to acquire an army bivy shelter. It's about a kilo. It resembles a one man coffin tent high up front low at the feet, it's covered in mosquito netting and comes with a water proof covering I mostly use on my bicycle. It folds and I toss it in the air it instantly unfolds like a magic trick. I can pack it up in under a minute if I got to. Perfect for those shakey spots in the open and you slept past sunup awakening to an indignant Karen with a little snapping dog. That's happened to me on more than one occasion. I say to Karen thanks for the wake up call and I start folding the thing in front of her and do my best to Karen charm her as I pack up and roll out on my bicycle before she can report me. Those bivys are legit af.
he1k68,,fvrw7i8,Yeah I am a big fan of bivies myself.  Paired with a tarp, having a modular system has a lot of advantages.  I love rolling up to a trail shelter and just throwing down my ground cover in 30 seconds then another 30 seconds to shake out my bivy.  Shelter done, just gotta get my pad and quilt in there which is also quick and easy.  Yeah, sorry to hear about the Karens.  I've run into some vagabonds and homeless out on trail before and honestly most of them have been good people, never had any problems.  I try and treat everyone with respect and anyone that does the same is welcome to share a spot at a campsite with me.  Keep your head up brother and don't let the Karens keep you down!  Let me know if you want any trail recipes and what kind of food you are into and I'd be happy to share :)
he1k68,,fvpnehw,I'm in California. I remind myself every day how I blessed I am to not deal with mosquitoes/ bugs.

he1k68,fvpnkfg,,Ive been searching for an ultra sleek but tough sleeping bag. My current bag is great for heat retention and very comfy, but it's a bit bulky (not heavy, just big).   Any tips on making or finding a really thin sleeping bag that will also be a 4 season bag?
he1k68,,fvpvvdh,I have a few suggestions. First, you can make your own thin/light/not so bulky sleeping quilt--either a down feather one, or a synthetic one or even both (more on using both soon).  Not my channel, but a good one, Backcountry Banter has some excellent videos on MYOG (make your own gear).  Here is one on a synthetic quilt: https://youtu.be/be4ciUndiBg  Here is one on a down quilt that only costs 20-30 bucks: https://youtu.be/lWXADqwo1W8  You can buy thinner (or thicker) Apex synthetic insulation that is used in the first video. I have an Apex quilt that I use in the summer that is good down to around 8C/46F with proper layers, and it has the 2.5oz Apex.  Down to freezing with proper layers you can use 5.0oz Apex, or you can combine and inner and an outer quilt and/or bag to keep warm too.  For example, let's say you make both of the above quilts, or maybe make the down quilt and keep your synthetic bag you already have. When it gets really cold you can sleep with the down quilt inside of the synthetic bag or quilt and be really toasty.  A downside of using down insulation is that if it gets wet and/or traps your body vapor/sweat, it will flatten out and not keep you warm.  It needs to stay dry and puffy to work efficiently to keep you warm--but when it's dry it works amazingly well and is the lightest and least bulky option you can get.  Another tip is that you can also combine a quilt or bag with a warmth bivy.  For example, say you make that Cosco down quilt in the video above and this will set you back say 25 bucks. Then you can combine this with a warmth bivy on the outside.  You can make one out of Tyvek that you can score for free or for cheap, and there are several videos I have seen of people doing this on Youtube.  Or you can take the easy and more efficient way, but it will set you back 40-50 bucks (or try and buy cheaper used on a forum), and buy a SOL Escape Lite bivy.  And no I am not sponsored by them or anyone.  But it's a great piece of gear.  It breaths well and reflects your body heat and is water resistant.  Plus when combined with a summer down quilt and proper layers (and good sleeping mat of course), it can be an option for a good 3 season sleep system.  It only weighs 150g/5.5oz and packs down small.  You should be able to fit a warmth bivy and a summer down quilt in an 8 liter drysack no problem, maybe even a few sleep layers in there too.  Hope this helps.  Take care out there and feel free to ask any more questions.
he1k68,fvqjehn,,I have terrible blisters (under my big toe) and corns (fourth toe!). Doesn't seems to matter what shoes I wear. I walk and ride my bicycle everywhere, but I also live in Florida. Any tips on foot care? Its absolutely essential.
he1k68,,fvqm0rv,I have a few tips you can try. One is to wear really thin socks (like, the thinnest you can find) under your normal socks. Lots of hikers do this double sock technique, even in warm temps.   You can also try rubbing your feet with petrolium jelly (aka Vasoline), and there is also specific foot rub you can get--tho Vasoline would probably be cheaper.   You may also consider buying shoes that fit better. A lot of hikers (myself included) size up a bit to account for foot swelling and/or rubbing.  Yes, foot care is very important. Also make sure to have good hygine, trim nails, etc. to help things. Take care!
he1k68,,g1o8my4,Micropore tape.  Also called papertape.  I use it on all hot spots before they become blisters.  Use it to tape toes together when I ummm  walk into something barefoot and crack a toe bad.  I use it in place of bandaids.    It can be washed like when you wash your hands.  It will air dry just fine.  I try to leave it on till the cut heals or the blister heals.  It can kind of wear off sometimes and I have to replace it.  I carry a roll of it everywhere.  A box of 10 on amazon is something like 15 dollars.  So about 1.50 or so per roll.  Saves a ton of money and works for my feet, hands, whatever.  Puncture wounds and deep cuts get proper care - lots of stitch replacements out there.  But for your blisters this is the stuff.  Also thin inner sock and then wool outer sock will make a difference. oh and sometimes i do a couple of pieces in a cross or something over the blister to stabilize the rub direction.
he1k68,fvpzxa4,,You mentioned keeping warm, but what about keeping cool? Are there any better fabrics at both breathing and holding sweat?  I sweat a ton so idk what would be better than cotton. Cotton breathes--it's like that Seinfeld episode.   Basically, I'll soak my clothes in sweat in the first hour of being out or in the first ten minutes of hiking. The wet clothes keep me cool. I'll even wear a bandana to catch my forehead sweat which then cools down my head. Without it, I still sweat my ass off because that's how my body works and then the sweat evaporates, causing me to sweat again when I heat back up and lose more water, causing dehydration.   Cotton kills in the winter and saves in the summer. Maybe polyester, but I hate the feeling of it.
he1k68,,fvq3lbc,Yeah, that's why when talking about fabrics I open up with "staying warm" and mention exceptions.  But if you're in a hot climate then yeah go for cotton, or another decent alternative is bamboo but harder to find and a bit more expensive.  I also suggest you buy as much white clothing and gear as possible to reflect sunlight rather than absorb it, especially your tent or tarp.  I'd also look into getting a sun umbrella.  There are some sun umbrellas that even have a reflective fabric on the outside to keep you cooler.  Then just make sure to keep hydrated, stick to the shade, and perhaps consider not hiking or being out when the sun is at its hottest (around noon to before sunset).  I have read about some desert backpackers that sleep during the middle of the day and hike in the evening and night to avoid the heat.  Good luck.
he1k68,,g1o921s,White linen.  Also if you can get a silver reflective umbrella to tie to your pack.  If you go by a farm that has geeenhouses they may have some stuff called aluminet.  Expensive but you only need a small piece for over your tarp or tent.  It is a mylar mesh.  It allows airflow but cuts the heat.  The stuff is da bomb.
he1k68,,g1p56um,White linen! I was thinking today that my cotton statement was pretty erroneous. I've noticed it does retain a lot of heat but polyester makes me sweat more for some reason. But I remember now, I had a white linen fishing shirt for a time that became encrusted with filth during the hiking, but before it did, it kept me insanely cool.   Looked up that aluminet stuff. That's definitely the next thing ima try to get. Thanks for the info! It's coming at a much needed time
he1k68,,g1p5foe,Scrub white linen on a washboard (you can carve one from wood - just sand it smooth before using buy also tiny asian plastic ones are sold in amazon)  Believe it or not the grime comes out really well compared to a washing machine.  My collars get gross shortly after summer starts.  And good luck staying cool.
he1k68,fvrjbn9,,Two questions to add to the discussion.  Thoughts on staying sane and entertained on the road?  How do you deal with small animals trying to loot your food?
he1k68,,fvruckg,Hey, good questions, thanks for asking.  There are pretty much unlimited free books you can download onto your phone, both text (e-books, PDFs, etc.) and audio.  Some of my personal favorites that I have read multiple times are Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," George Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four," Kate Chopin's "The Awakening," and various collections of folklore and mythology from around the world (like Ovid's "Metamorphoses").  I also practice meditation, both active (like, while I am hiking and aware of my surroundings) and more traditional sitting and breathing while I am at camp.  Meditation may be frustrating at first but it is something that takes practice and it has really helped my mental and emotional well being and costs nothing.  Google some articles on how to meditate or watch a few videos on Youtube on the subject.  In short: everyone needs a break from themselves and their own inner voice(s) and at times chaotic mind.  It is exhausting to have your mind filled with past events and worrying about the future.  Meditation is a focus on the present: the right now.  The goal is to not think at all, to just exist and breath and that's it.  There is a mountain of research that proves that meditation has real, concrete benefits for people and places like schools (I am a teacher and do it with my students at times) to prisons to hospitals.  There is also a ton of stuff to do out in the wild!  Go for a swim, carve a pair of chopsticks for your noodles you're going to eat later on, watch animals, harvest wild edible plants and fungus (just be careful with this or you can literally get yourself killed!), etc.  There are plenty of free resources online you can learn more on these things (wood carving, bird watching, wild edibles, etc.), visit your local library or download some books or watch some videos.  Then at camp put your knowledge into practice.  I could go on.  I am rarely ever bored while I am out backpacking.  Now on to animals.  This is all about location, so ask around about what critters to look out for.  For example, where I hike what I have to worry about most are mostly mice and scavenger birds (seagulls, crows, etc.) and the occasional badger or boar from messing with my food.  So I just hang my food bag (which is in a waterproof drybag) up high on the limb of a tree or from a nail at a trail shelter.  But I have hiked through bear country before and then used a rope to hang my bag high up in a tree (Google "bear bagging").  If there are lots of pests that can get into your food, get some rope--and this is key-- that is smooth so that it slides over branches easy when you pull it up or lower it down.  It is also important to practice good routines in camp.  Don't make a mess with your food so you don't attract critters to your campsite, cook meals away from your campsite if possible, or if you are in a more permanent campsite you can at least wash up your pot/mess kit away from your campsite.  Now here's a little tip to keep humans from stealing your food, and it's free, easy, and fairly effective.  Write a note to put inside of your food bag that says something like: "Dear thief, one of these meals is laced with rat poison and only I know which one.  Please leave my food alone.  If you are really hungry I can share some with you, just ask me.  My name is ________.  Thank you and have a nice day."  Make sure to include your name so the thief takes a moment, even if it is unconscious, to reflect on the fact that you are a human being.  Knowing a person's name helps to humanize them.  Hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions.
he1k68,,fvrv257,Thanks! I'm glad you've thought through so much of this stuff. Have you ever considered writing a book(or a blog maybe?)? Like "Little Book of Backpack Knowledge" or something. I know they've been done to death, but something that isn't secretly trying to sell me specific brands of gear would be a refresher within that genre.  Also for anyone wondering about free books, direct link: www.gutenberg.org

he1k68,fvwwh9m,,So out in the trail are you going all natural with leaves or do you do TP and is regular TP biodegradable or do you have to pack it out with you?
he1k68,,fvxhn7r,It will depend on different locations.  Some locations you have to pack out your TP, and there are even some locations that you have to pack out your poop.  But lucky for me, where I hike it is okay to dig cat holes and bury your TP and poop.  My personal routines are to use natural wipes (leaves, moss, grass, etc.) for about 80% of my business, then I will finish up with some TP.  Make sure if you're going to dig a cat hole to dig it down properly, meaning deep enough, and also have a stick with you to mix some dirt into it to help it get broken down faster.  There is actually debate on whether or not regular TP is biodegradable or not.  I am convinced it is biodegradable enough.  It is, after all, mostly wood pulp.  The idea of biodegradable we should see as a spectrum rather than a black and white issue, and err on the side of caution to respect and take care of mother nature.
he1k68,,g1o9pz8,I use an medical squirt bottle.  Epineal or something and a hankerchief to wipe.  Hang hanky off my pack to dry.  For the other stuff I dig a cathole and use tp.
he1k68,fz8yb02,,Hello.   I know how to keep myself warm etc., I'm just wondering do you know if there is a way to shelter yourself from weather such as rain and wind when in a hammock and/or in trees. I know it probably sounds like a silly question. I know stuff about shelter for on the ground but not really any effective methods of sheltering when off the ground such as keeping wind, rain, water, etc. off your face and getting soaked.
he1k68,,fza3dn3,Hey there!  To keep dry in a hammock, use a tarp.  Do a Youtube search for hammock tarps to see how to pitch one.   The short of it is that you attach the ridge lines of the tarp to the trees you are using for the hammock.  You can buy a cheap tarp or even make one out of plastic sheeting if you are really broke.  To keep bugs off you and add another layer of protection from wind and rain spray, you can look into getting a bug net to cover your hammock.  Or this could be as simple as using a sheet of fabric, like say a bed sheet or a thin fleece blanket, pitched over your hammock.  Don't forget to add some drip lines to your tarp by the way, so that when it rains the water doesn't run down your hammock and/or tarp straps/guy lines and into your hammock.  This is easy to do, just tie some cords to the straps and/or lines to make the water drip well before it gets to your hammock.  You can do a Youtube or Google search for drip lines for a hammock as well.  Hope this helps, and take care.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

hcv6nx,fvjeabf,,We can't do that!. politicians would lose all those buzzwords and then would have no one to pretend to care about so they can write bills they will skim off of.
hcv6nx,fvhn9il,,No. You can't
hcv6nx,fviej3q,,You can't end homelessness with just money. It'll help for sure, but short of forcefully institutionalizing those who don't adapt to housing conditions then homelessness will unfortunately always exist. I've been working with homeless people for years and the unfortunate reality is that some people are "un-helpable". For every 10 homeless people I help get housed, I would estimate that at least three of them are back on the streets within months, some of them within weeks. Just the other week I helped someone get out of the shelter and he was back in the shelter within ***two days***.  The reasons for this are varied. Some people are mentally ill and probably require intensive hospitalization for the rest of their lives. Some are drug addicts and don't take to rehab for whatever reason. And then some just for whatever reason can't abide by the simplest of requirements for their housing program. We have a block of apartment units that have a very simple set of rules:  1. Must see a case manager once a week  2. Must sign in every day on a sign in sheet. It lets our funding sources know that the bed is being used.  3. No alcohol or illicit drugs of any kind on property, to include mmarijuana because we receive federal funding. It's not a sober program, clients are welcome to travel off property and engage in that stuff. It's not encouraged but they won't be punished.   4. Curfew is midnight Sunday-Thursday and 0100 on weekends.   5. Must engage with your plan of action.  That's literally it, and many clients are unable to abide by these simple rules. It's not always completely their fault, but I would argue that it usually is.  Money is needed, but money alone can't solve the problem. The problem isn't completely solvable. That's the reality.
hcv6nx,,fvisrvi,> Some are drug addicts and don't take to rehab for whatever reason.  Having worked with addicts, gone thru rehab and become clean eventually, can attest to how difficult it is to quit and stay quit. Many addicts go thru a cycle of rehab-relapse.  The ones going thru the process are at least trying. Imo, they should be allowed to return if they relapse and keep coming back.  edit: differentiating those from addicts that just use programs as 'crash pads'. A recovery specialist (recovered addict) should help oversee the program of housing to tell. They can't be fooled.
hcv6nx,,fvifzjh,What about people who work? I work overnight, so I would never make "curfew" (which is, honestly, a ridiculous requirement to have on an apartment. I get it for shelters, but that's a bit much for someone's own apartment).   These are simple requirements, in your mind. But I already wouldn't meet them because I have a job that doesn't fit them. Nothing is ever so simple.
hcv6nx,,fvigquh,Obviously work is an exception. There are a few exceptions to the curfew, with your job being one of them.  They're not apartments in the traditional sense where its "yours". For all intents and purposes, it's still a shelter. It's a bridge program to slowly reintegrate the homeless back into "normal" housing behavior. They're three bedroom units and you live with five other people.   The curfew is there because we have to be able to tell our funding sources that the beds are being actively used. If people are out and about all night partying, the bed should go to another individual that's going to use it. The rules are *so* simple.
hcv6nx,,fvjby31,I agree with some aspects of your post.  Such as some people will just not adapt to living inside and following a minimum amount of rules.  However I do believe and know homeless could be solved but it would take a major political overhaul and major amount of effort which I don't see this present political structure doing.
hcv6nx,,fvj5az4,Change your program then.  Housing ends homelessness.  Full stop.  You have inadequate on site supports and silly rules.  You could easily use more funds to create more intense supports and 24/7 assistance for the highest acuity folks.  Once a week is great for those who can live independently, if you have a fucking sign in sheet, man, once a week doesn't even come close.
hcv6nx,,fvjiubq,> Housing ends homelessness. Full stop.  Except it doesn't. Otherwise people wouldn't find themselves back on the street after they obtain housing.   > You could easily use more funds to create more intense supports and 24/7 assistance for the highest acuity folks  I agree, we could always use more money for more intensive programs and more support, I said that. Money alone won't completely solve the issue though.   > You have inadequate on site supports and silly rules.   How are the rules silly? Curfew? If you're out all night you're not using the bed. Daily sign in sheet? If you're not signing in then you must not be here using the bed. If you need more case management and more structure, then the options are there. Once a week is the minimum.
hcv6nx,,fvk6jdi,I feel bad for you now.  Go read the Org Code blog and take some sessions.  It's clear you mean well but theres no reason whatsoever supportive housing (ie: housing) cant solve homelessness so long as supports are customized to the person.  A sign in sheet for everyone is degrading, insulting and completely unnecessary as a generalized rule.  It's a Marvin rule.  Sounds like you run a jail.
hcv6nx,,fvkgfny,Tell that to our funding sources then, most of which are federal agencies. If you think its degrading though then you must not be familiar with the definition of the term. There are valid reasons for it and it's the bare minimum we ask of our residents daily because we dont lord over them like you seem to think. They have all the freedom they want there. You sure you know what jail is?
hcv6nx,fvkxl9p,,la spent $619mil in 2018 only resulting in a slight decrease of homelessness.  https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-homeless-housing-count-20190511-story.html
hcv6nx,fwfakzn,,Cops are underpaid, overworked, and don't do a very good job at all. They suck ass at their job. They just suck at life in general. "Oh this person that tried to fucking kill you a few seconds ago, well now you get to go back into the house he kicked you out from and sleep under the same roof as him."
hcv6nx,fvi2ewr,,Wouldn‚Äôt work. More homeless people would move to LA to take advantage of the programs.
hcv6nx,,fvie6ud,Most have already moved to LA for the clement weather. Besides, it's not about what works and what doesn't. It's about protecting the rich from the poor.
hcv6nx,,fvit3lf,The limited program has long waiting list, specific criteria, many people wouldn't qualify, let alone move from impoverished conditions to the same conditions somewhere else.
hcagyf,fve47af,,Perhaps you could set your expectations a little higher for the person you want to spend the next 50 years with and ask if this is this the family you want to marry into?  You marry him, you marry them.  If the answer is yes; Mazel tov! He sounds like a real catch!

And when you try and warn off a woman, they attack you and say you don't know . . .and they are the ones who expect you to take them in when they need a place to crash, then call up the abuser to come get them and YOU are now the abuser's target!    I gave up on even trying to help 'abused women' who refuse to dump the abuser, and will drag good samaritans to death with them.    These are the ones on Dr Phil, doing that gulping snotclot fake crying shit, saying but he really looooooves me I don't wanna leave just change him, Dr Phil!  Do women think this horrid acting out works on anyone?  Grow the fuck up, chickypoo.  I see these idiots, I can see why their partners hate them!    Dr Phil just shakes his head, tells the woman she has to leave, and she rejects all advice.    Such women are sinking ships and will drag you to the bottom of the sea with them if you get too close.
hcagyf,g0ua2ml,,Wow.  You are supporting a deadbeat and now his family . . and you get beat up.  Might I suggest a new name, a new town, and leave all this behind?  You're being pimped.  There is a reason his family is homeless and they will drag you back to the streets with them.
hcagyf,fvemb5n,,This was hard to read due to the wall of text.  > Hi, I'm a 33 year old female that lives in Sothern California and I have been trying to help my Fiancee's homless mother, father and 2 kids, a 15 year old girl and a 17 year old boy find housing while they are currently living out of 2 filthy, hordered, trash, cockroach and other bug infested vans for about 5 years now. The reason they are homless is because they got kicked out of their last apartment for loud fighting all the time and the father was spending most there money on alcohol and prostitution. The whole family is in denial about the prostitution but my Fiancee has proof this is the case. His father also had a stroke last year so he is disabled and can't work as a mobal mechanic and kind of support his family anymore...  > They are a Mexican family and the mother and father are illegal immigrants from Mexico. They have no pappers and will not get them.  > The mother has never worked and has some severe hoarding issues. (Like the stuff you see on tye tv show, "Hoarders." ) She does some nasty stuff and yes I believe it has to do with mental health issues but thats my opinion and I am not a doctor and I would never judge her for that I would love to see her get some help, the same with the dad and his issues...  > Anyway, my Fiancee has been living with me rent free on and off for 2 years then officially he has moved in with me still rent free for the last 2 years, so 4 years total he has been living with me. and we take his younger brother who's 17 now and sometimes his younger sister who's now 15, in sometimes so they have a roof over their head, a shower and some homemade hot food on the weekends...And I don't ask for anything in return. I'm just happy to help and when I am able to I will do anything to help my Fiancee or anyone in need.  > Besides trying to help them find housing, my Fiancee and I have been asking them for a year now to clean out the vans that they are living in and they just keep adding junk to them and not doing what we are asking of them when they don't have anything else to do... seriously... One of the vans belongs to my Fiancee that he lent them to SLEEP in so they have more space for all of them to SLEEP. But the mom just keeps adding more junk and food that goes bad to van and now there is no space to sleep. So they sleep sitting up.  > Both vans are cockroach infested and they keep spraying pesticide in the van so there are millions of dead and alive ones in the vans and food and the father keeps getting sick and has been going to the hospital frequenting after his stroke last year. Since I told them a while back I would call CPS if they didn't clean out the vans and they didn't so i did call CPS about 6 months ago and CPS didn't do shit. To this day my Fiancee's parents still haven't taken the threat seriously and last Saturday I put my foot down and spoke to them over the phone since they wont listen to my Fiancee, (their son,) or anyone at all and told them, " look, if you don't clean out both vans and do what we ask as owners of the van I will call the authorities and have them take a look at your living situation and they can do what they need to do to get these kids safe.. And we will also be taking back the van we let them barrow if nothing is clean... "  > So we gave them till last Sunday at 5pm. As Sunday rolls around to 5pm we head over to where they always park the vans and they were still filthy and nasty with cockroaches everywhere and still in the food. My Fioncee and I were prepared to cockroache bomb the 2 vans right then and there to help them, if they had cleaned it all out. Well it wasn't clean at all.  > So I told them I was calling the Authorities to do their part because they have 2 underage teens living like this and we have been asking them for about a year now to get things clean. I only did this because I want the best for these kids. They don't deserve to live in these conditions especially when there is a deadly virus going around and homless people are more susceptible to getting the virus.  > Anyway, my Fiancee's other sister who is 21 (and has her own place and a very young daughter.) came to see what was going on and she just started beating me up there in front of a ton of people including her underage siblings because, "It was none my business...." (Idiot... the cops were already on their way before she beat me anddddd she has a young child... she could have gotten arrested and her child taken away for doing this to me.)  > I am 33 years old and I have not once in my whole life ever been in a physical fight and would never start a fight in general. I never associat myself with trashy people who think physical fighting is the answer. I don't think she realizes I took her older brother (My Fioncee now,) in when he was homless 4 years ago and i take care of her teen brother on the weekends and sometimes her teen sister. And did I forget to mention, I got a bunch of cockroaches in my apartment from the younger brother coming to spend the night a while back and I know it was him because he admitted to my Fioncee he was the one who brought them in. So It is my business. These people made it my business when they started asking me take care of their teen children on the weekends.  > So, when the cops came about 15min after she let up off of beating me up and my face was all bloody but that wasn't what I cared about. I was more worried about these kids than my face so i didn't press charges when the cops asked me if I wanted to so they didn't arrest her. That wasnt the reason I called the Authorities in the firat place so I'm not going to let her beating me up distract me from what really needs to be done here. Now that the cops were there they looked in their vans and told me there is nothing they can do and it is not illegal to live that way.... WTF!!!!  > Someone tell me this is just wrong! Or should I have really just really minded my own business so I didn't have to get my face and body beat up? OH, and yes we deffinatly took the van that we let them barrow away after all this and we are cleaning it ourselves and preparing to sell it. so now the mother that was so terrified to clean the vans because she didn't want to loose anything, is now out of everything in the van we took back. All we can do now since they have nothing of ours anymore is just not have anything to do with them anymore, not lend them any more money or anything anymore, ignore the hate and just pray for them, that they will want to get help someday.  > I would like your opinion on what I should do now or what not to do and should I have pressed charges against the 21 year old sister? Should I or is it too late? I feel like now I should have because she made me loose my brand new engagment ring my Fiancee just got me while she was beating me up. Let me know what you think about all this. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen. I really appreciate it. God bless  I don't understand how the fiance's father can visit prostitutes after suffering from a stroke and having no money.  Yes you should press charges against someone who assaulted you. The van is a loss, but don't let these people on your property anymore. Unfortunately neither CPS nor the police seem to care. You cannot fix their problems, so it's best that you can't see them anymore.
hcagyf,,fvf2afe,He was into prostitution before the stroke that made them homless
hcagyf,,g0ubiz9,She needs to send the finance back to his van with his family and move away without leaving a forwarding address.
hcagyf,fvjh5od,,I'm concerned with your partner's parents getting deported.  First make sure his siblings have everything they need to establish US citizenship and identification.  Maybe contact agencies that help undocumented people. Even though these people are unpleasant, deportation would be devastating.  Focus your efforts on helping the kids with basics, and a path out of the living situation.  Bless you for helping your partner's family.
hcagyf,,g0ue53d,If they are here illegally they should be deported.  After finance gets his green card by marrying Miss Patsy, he can have them all return and live with him and his patsy.  Until they drive her off from her own home.    I get so tired, so bored, so pissed off at the same old story being repeated, at women pimping themselves and then expecting help and pity from everyone else for playing themselves.
hcagyf,fvkx3bn,,Move far far away from them and just live with your fiancee. It's hard to believe but some people are just enabled further by 'helping' which just postpones the inevitable that helps them to change.
hcagyf,,g0ubq9n,The only reason her 'finance' is with her is to steal stuff and give her money and home to his deadbeat family.    They SHOULD be deported.  Don't marry this thug or you will end up hosting the entire family and you'll be the only one paying bills, OP.    Or just go along to get along with a finance pimping you and letting his thug sister beat you up.    Won't be long before her daugher is stealing from you and beating you, too, OP.
hcagyf,fvdw5bw,,Fianƒáe is for men, Fianc√©e is for women  But yeah press charges if you want and then get the fuck away from those people
hcagyf,,fvhf9sg,Wait, what?! I never knew that.
hcagyf,,fvzpkgz,TIL.
hcagyf,,fvdx1pi,Oh thank you for correcting my spelling. I'm not the best when it comes to writing and spelling but anyway thank you for ypur input! ‚ô°
hammhr,fv9979d,,Glad you enjoyed it!! ü§ô
hammhr,fv6kjv5,,Honestly it's the best feeling today I was panhandling and this lady came up to me with a bag and said she made a home cooked meal for me and a couple other people  It was the sweetest thing ever And the food was really good I don't know about you but when you're homeless a hot cooked meal from people that aren't judging you and actually kind is the best thing ever
hammhr,fv3rcz1,,Glad you ate well
hammhr,fv41t6c,,Niceeee
hammhr,fv478a7,,LOL; yesterday I almost threw up after a hot dog. I can't imagine a whole pizza. Are you feeling okay? <3
hammhr,fv53twv,,I'm glad you enjoyed your pizza!
hammhr,fv5b6xa,,Hope you don't upset your stomach. Save that slice for later or pass it on! Good luck wherever you are. :D
hb7gp7,fv7qn8b,,Man, that's awesome. Good for you!
hb7gp7,fv8nx6h,,Awesome! Keep on keepin on!
hb7gp7,fv8wdp5,,Well done.  Look after yourself.
hb7gp7,fv98mi4,,First step in a good journey getting you off the streets. Congrats.
hb7gp7,fv9nrzh,,All hail to the kindness of strangers!   Good luck to you!
haeutq,fv2dey0,,If you can help me out that would be amazing!
haeutq,,fv2dwpd,Dm me a Domino's address you can get to. I'll order it now.
haeutq,,fv2eg46,Done.
haeutq,,fv2eysv,Done
haeutq,,fv2iizj,Somebody get this man a cape! No joke.
haeutq,,fv3nwko,Enjoyed your pizza?
haeutq,,fv2m4ds,Good on you man/girl.
haeutq,fv2khoq,,It's amazing to see people helping out on this sub.   Thank you, kind stranger!!
haeutq,,fv2mgr6,I saw the same thing in /r/Assistance recently, maybe this kind soul saw the same. I've been thinking about doing the same even all the way from the UK because I know you guys are in such a bad way and I want to help too. I just don't want to order pizza for people that don't actually need it as I'd like a pizza myself right now but am too tight and not rolling in it to order one even for myself haha. But good on this guy. The world needs more people looking out for each other.  Someone should make /r/feedingthehomeless - that'd really piss that orange bastard off if it became popular.
haeutq,,fv2p7y2,Actually I started doing this a few weeks ago when I had a job, stable home, etc...now I'm barley scraping by but I still have a home and food for now.  I remember my longest stretch without food at 12 days when I was homeless. And The longest without hot food at like 4 months. I can't stand people being hungry, there is no need for that when we waste so much food.  Sorry for the rant. But yeah I try to help when I can. And fuck the orange headed, toupee wearing, wrinkly ass butt hole.
haeutq,,fv2qthh,I agree and I hate wasting food. I am not a fat bastard by any means but I make sure to try and eat everything I buy, it's not good throwing away food that could've gone to someone in need or if it's meat an animal dying and it not being consumed... But now thinking about it, sausages (the last thing I threw away) were most likely multiple pigs... Anyway, good on you for helping out mate.
haeutq,,fv2s4ck,Thanks! Your first comment actually got me thinking, I may try to set something up to see if I can get food out to a lot of people. I already hit up my old boss and we working on something now. So, I must say thank you to you as well. At the very minimum because of you there will be at least 50+ people who are going to be able to eat and have a good time on the 4th of July.
haeutq,,fv2skxh,Ah thank you very much for the compliment, but I think that's a bit over-zealous. I'll help you set up that sub though if you like and make you moderator?
haeutq,,fv2sxrt,I was actually thinking about going big and setting up a non profit. But I'd be down to setup the sub as well!
haeutq,,fv2tf7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelessandhungry/  I have made you moderator. Do as you please with the sub :)
haeutq,,fv2nn7d,Look at this guy:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ_Cy2toIBo  He bought this dude (who doesn't seem particularly thankful might I add) a $150-200 pair of boots, I personally wouldn't have done what he did but my hat's off to him. He really cares, even if he never got a proper thank you.
haeutq,fv2h14g,,Thank you for kicking down to those that need
haeutq,fv2ofn9,,I do. Got nowhere to stay and had my jacket stolen from me today. I'd greatly appreciate it. Unemployment is not getting anywhere any time soon of at all.
haeutq,,fv2remp,I'm so sorry to here that. Unfortunately I sent it to the person who hit me up first. I wish I could afford to help more people out as well. Good Luck
haeutq,,fv3l5nd,r/randomactsofpizza might have your back
haeutq,fv2om9w,,Amazing. Good karma for real
h91vuv,fuug69h,,being a homeless woman is soooo scary. I pray we all get through this.
h91vuv,fuud2wj,,It really truly is. Are there any decent ladies only shelters in your area? Also, ladies can do much better than guys when flying sign, if you are up for that. Just pick a good spot, lots of traffic, very visible. With luck you could get enough for a room every couple of days at least. Keep an eye out for another lady who needs a buddy so you can watch each others backs. UNtil then, keep your phone charged and handy and dont be afraid to call 911 for the slightest reason. Good luck to you.
h91vuv,,fuugcuj,be careful linking up with another woman. I almost got wrapped up in sex trafficking because of it. traffickers often use other women as bait to catch more girls out on the streets alone. be safe! I can not stress that enough
h91vuv,,fuv27cf,True. Using a female, it brings your guard down, but behind them is evil. Don‚Äôt go anywhere that‚Äôs isolated with anyone. Stay visible. Where are you located, without giving exact location?Don‚Äôt ever give exact location. Don‚Äôt keep a routine where people will know where you will be at any given time
h91vuv,,fuvkqis,For real though. Had a local pimp in the tent city outside the shelter. He lived in a camper with a couple of women, and would hang out on the street while they used it for work. Had to walk past it all the time, the two women would try to rope in other women and- even more so- young girls. I wasn't a minor, but I looked like one, and everyone could see I was on my own. Lotta people thought I was a runaway, or abandoned. Got targeted, harassed and attacked more often than some of my peers as a result. More so when someone pegged me as queer- pan/nonbinary, never passed as cis/het in my entire life- so shit could get crazy real fast out there.  Anyway, when they realized that whoever they had their eye on wasn't going to be fooled, their pimp would drive the camper around, waiting for you to be isolated, cornered, waiting for the train to pass, etc. If you weren't on guard all the time, if you weren't quick on your feet, if you couldn't scamble over a fence or a hole in the wall...   Well, I was lucky I never got to see the inside of that camper, or the bottom of death river.  There are plenty of other stories I have of being homeless as a female. Lots of attempted kidnappings, stalking, and various acts of assault- sexual or otherwise- and one outright attempt on my life. But I figured I would keep it small. It's dangerous out there, you have to keep your head clear, and be aware of your surroundings. You gotta know that *people* are dangerous, no matter their sex/gender. So even if you got the same bits, even if you're the same age, even if you feel you have *something* that unites you, always play it close to your chest, always try to spot the danger in any given situation before you step in it.  Stay safe out there, everyone.
h91vuv,,fv2ofk0,Thank you for those reminders, friend.
h91vuv,fuuyw1j,,Must be hell. I don't feel safe unless Im strapped and I'm a big dude
h91vuv,fuv9qld,,As a guy with a car, i can kinda sympathize. I get a hotel room every once in a while, but even then..  Its rough.   Stay safe op. And all the women out there. Stay safe.  If i could share my room with you without it being weird as fuck, i would.  Checkout times are an issue.  We get in and out, bot a problem.  Its when people want to stay longer than the paid time.  Thats why i dont share. Because PEOPLE suck.  I would have no problem getting 2 beds. Same price. Its when people have to leave.  People dont leave. That shit goes on my card.  I dont like that. So... I dont do that, male or female.
h91vuv,,fuxqeqk,Yeah i got a card i use but when i panhandle enough's cash occasionally ill go and load the debit card and use it to get room at the local cheap motel.  Just need to catch a break. Hope this unemployment comes thru love. Thanks for offer
h91vuv,,fuxqkct,People can be so rude and not get picture to leave. I get anxiety and leave well before check out lol. I get anxiety watching clock knowing ok t minus 2 hours and 5 minutes im bsck on street
h91vuv,,fuxthrc,I find it funny that a room with one bed is the same price as a room with 2 beds. Doesnt make sense in my head.
h91vuv,,fuxhb8q,A sound policy. Hope things get better for you. :(
h91vuv,fuvkn0x,,Best you can do, honestly, is just not trust anyone. Its harder to be living this life as a girl. You'll naturally want to trust. Unfortunatetly the predators out here don't introduce themselves as such. I'm a guy, and I have to keep that in mind. Some guy contacted me thru reddut, offering help, money, seemed like he cared. Turns out he was just some lonely rich gay guy who thought he could buy me.... Well that ain't happening. If I were gay, who knows, if I was desperate for food, shelter, or whatever. But I'm none of the above. I have 'shelter', albeit not a real home. But I ain't getting rained on, or freezing my ass off at night, or seen by anyone. Its a place I can safely hide my things. I have some money. Not millions of dollars, but I can afford to buy a cheeseburger if I get hungry, or aspirin for a backache. I have a job, and in time, I'll save my money up and move on from this life.   You just need to try and get into that mindset. Don't trust anyone. Creeps, perverts, and assholes will try and come across as though they were Brother Teresa.
h91vuv,fuum7po,,You are not alone. I wish I could forget half the things I've survived
h91vuv,fuu7yq4,,Damn that sucks im a guy and homeless I never realized how hard a woman would have it the way I see it were all in the same boat and we need to help each other out as much as we can without needing something in return I have all I need I live out in the woods and I enjoy life
h91vuv,,fuwx6d9,Women always think they have it harder. Homeless men are raped too, it‚Äôs just that nobody cares and they are much less likely to talk about it.  The truth is that although women may be physically more vulnerable than men on average, people of both sexes are much more willing to help and trust them.  It‚Äôs much easier for women to avoid becoming and escape homelessness because of that. Which is why the homeless are overwhelmingly male, especially the rough sleepers.
h91vuv,fuv0h0d,,Be safe and keep your head on a swivel as you are alone.
h91vuv,fv07rrj,,I got curious once and actually did an online social experiment on a craigy were I pretended to be a homeless chick, and within 2 hours about 200 dudes messaged me with "offers" of varying creepiness. A few seemed genuine, but you really can't tell. It's common for homeless girls to be given shelter by seemingly generous men, and then suddenly threatened with eviction after it's been 2 weeks and the dude still hasn't gotten his "thank you" BJ.   However, It's unusual for an attractive woman to be homeless for too long, especially nowadays with social media. Someone like isabel Lucas wouldnt even have to do anything lude,  she'd easily make $100 a day just taking pictures of herself in modest clothes and talking to thirsty dudes.  Honestly, You need to find an empathetic female roomate who's willing to help you for a month until you find work.
h91vuv,fuxr00q,,Today i was trying to get motel room for another night and this dude was like yeah i got the 80 dollars but what u gonna do for me. I wanted to swallow my pride and do it for my kids but at thr same time id rather earn it the hard way and have respect for myself. So ill be camping again till who knows when but we will make it
h91vuv,,fuz9f34,You should NEVER give up your dignity for a place.  Hoping your situation gets better.  Respect.
h91vuv,,fv0891d,Yep, dont ever convince yourself that you have to go there. It's better to be a homeless beggar than resort to that, start a patreon or something, at least for food.
h91vuv,,fuzbg1a,The thing is, easier for me to say, but your kids learn from you. Even though you think it would help your kids perhaps, in the long run,  your kids learn lessons from you that will carry them over in many hard times in life.
h91vuv,fuve8nr,,Maybe put down the heroin, I'm recently homeless so I feel this on every level.
h91vuv,fuxvvqs,,Go camping much cheaper then a motel room.
h91vuv,fuxw47n,,If you are a woman who has kids those homeless advocates works for the state can help you out fast.  They will get you a place etc...
h91vuv,fuxtmqs,,Hi. I'm a single 36 year old female going through the same thing.
h91vuv,fv4m1ht,,[Previous discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/9rboi6/ladies_how_do_you_deal_with_harassment/)
h90ikt,fuu1xdm,,There are no homeless friendly cities.
h90ikt,,fuuf9r8,Yeah spot on city hate the homeless if you don't pay property taxes your not valued
h90ikt,fuu8dsf,,Go deep in the woods man the deeper the better I'd reccomend woods near railroad tracks and airports people will leave you alone there
h90ikt,,fuu9w23,Thank you, that's a good answer. Am I generally allowed to sleep in the woods? Ideally I would want to go to woods that are near a city so I can still get food.
h90ikt,,fuz3jc5,The counterpoint to going deep in the woods is that if misfortune should befall you, there will be no-one to act as a witness or render aid.  Beyond wild animals, there are many people who would derive great pleasure doing you grave harm in such a situation - it is dangerous & foolish, doubly so if you have no experience.  Tents are regularly destroyed, and those sleeping in them are vulnerable.  Sleeping in a car is your best option - it allows you to relocate with ease, and provides needed leverage for employment.  Your goal needs to be regular income and reliable shelter.
h90ikt,,fuuafj3,That's why you go really deep so no one will mess with you don't worry about permission your goal is to survive they have tons of free survival guides you can be completely self sufficient
h90ikt,fuuewza,,If you ever find a city where the cops don't bother you for being homeless let me know. As far as where to go, somewhere cars don't and people can't see you. I ain't ever had a squirrel call the cops on me yet and I've been homeless 11 years.
h90ikt,,fuuge14,Thank you very much, that' good advice. Can you tell me what the main reasons for cops bothering you are?
h90ikt,,fuwc798,Karens seeing me go in and out of a spot so they do what Karen's do best and call the cops. That's why you have to find a place you can go in and out of without being seen. Or another of my favorite moves is to stand in a driveway of an abandoned house looking suspicious for about 10 minutes to give it a good Karenization. Then I ride my bicycle to another abandoned property that has alot of traffic drive by and Karenize that spot as well. I repeat the process 3 or 4 times before finally moving to the spot I'm actually going to camp at. I get those Karens working for me. After awhile the cops get sick of looking for me and give up. Bonus points if you can Karenize a poison ivy filled lot for them to poke around in lol.
h90ikt,futz940,,>. Can you guys recommend some homeless-friendly cities with warm climate? Somewhere where the cops won't harass me for being homeless?  Bikini Bottom
h90ikt,,fuu3acd,Someone is clearly reading too much of encyclopedia spongebobia. ü§£
h90ikt,fuucqpy,,Pretty much anywhere.  There was a big case about it that went from Idaho to the Supreme Court recently.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-16/supreme-court-refuses-to-revive-city-s-outdoor-sleeping-ban   That being said there's all sorts of municipality and city ordances depending where you're at.
h90ikt,,fuvj552,OP, the case referred to above does not apply 'almost anywhere'.  The Supremes refused to rule on the issue, leaving a 9th circuit court ruling to stand.  So it applies anywhere in the 9th circuit court's territory:  Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and several Pacific Islands.  It does not apply in the rest of the country.  Other circuit courts - most notably the 2nd, 4th, and the 11th - have standing rulings that are not so favorable.
h90ikt,fuw7463,,Asheville, NC has always been considered fairly friendly to the homeless, I'm not sure how much that's changed with the virus . Anywhere there's cops - they'll harass you. Stay safe and good luck ‚ô•Ô∏è

h8da69,fuqa5b3,,Nice! What's it like out there?
h8da69,,fuqc1gs,Currently hot xtreme hot. And now down pouring. I secured funds for 2 more nights for a motel to  get of rain. The spot is having issues with ants. Like 5 different kinds of species of ants. Any suggestions friends
h8da69,,fuqh4o3,Gonna need a top tarp and shallow moat vs ants.  Gather plastic bags to line a hand width moat around.  Fill with water
h8da69,,fuqokji,What u mean top tarp? Like to go over my main tent or underneath it? The ants seem to get in thru the mesh its so annoying.  I dont mind coexisting but they are coming into my home
h8da69,,fuqqs6t,top tarp for the rain, and dig a moat around bottom tarp for the ants
h8da69,,fuqr240,Thanks
h8da69,,fuqrsqq,Also, they will come in for food. Remove all crumbs etc, and see if that helps.
h8da69,,furqiuy,They care about food, but I‚Äôve seen them go on paper towels and useless. Non food items. They make no sense. Just zombies.
h8da69,,fus6h9q,They also like small pools of water
h8da69,,fv6nazv,Hahahahahahah they would too
h8da69,,fuv2jgs,Get some tero stakes too it will help it's poison for ants they eat it and take it back to the nest
h8da69,,fus9dxu,Awesome bro reminded me of popeye and when they had a moat and the ants hopped in a can and floated across it to fuck their shit up haha
h8da69,,fv6n93l,Hahahahaha a they would too
h8da69,,fur8nmp,Diatemacious earth is great for ants, fleas, etc. I'd also recommend a platform or suspension if possible
h8da69,,futs0x3,Yes this would be the environmentally safe method
h8da69,,fuqfasu,Try feed them Borox, 20 Mule train Borox and sugar mix. Try liquid and dry and see which works. They don‚Äôt die immediately and take it to their home base. Some people have said it works. Your try. They sell Borox detergent.  Edit: not sure about my own experience if it works.
h8da69,,fur0xrc,It works great. Mix 3 parts powdered sugar with 1 part Borax in water. Then, dip cotton balls in it and place them wherever you find ant trails or groups of ants. Then let them swarm the cotton balls. They WILL take it back to the Queen. It‚Äôll kill the whole colony in a couple of days.
h8da69,,fv6ncvw,How successful have you been using this method
h8da69,,fuqr2j4,Ortho Home Defense, if you have the funds for it, works great on ants.
h8da69,,fusi3b6,Try not to eat in your tent if you can help it.
h8da69,,fv1mnbb,Aunts hate plain cinnamon.  Don't use the sweetened cinnamon.
h8da69,,fw8b9ar,Boric acid mixed with sugar and water in a shallow cup near but not in your area. The ants take it back to the nest. Encourage them to feed. It works in three or so days, at least for the little sugar eating ants.  Keep away from kids as it would be poisonous.

h7g8tg,,fuoxgpa,According to this site, statistically it‚Äôs eleven years old.  https://firstfocus.org/blog/can-you-guess-the-average-age-of-homelessness-in-the-united-states
h7g8tg,fuld4p1,,The answer is "a moving target".  The California housing crisis has an unusual "symptom": elderly people being dropped off at homeless shelters by their adult children. So I guess the age is going up?  But there are many homeless families with children too. They tend to be harder to count. (The majority of homeless people you see on the streets are adult men, because youth, women, and families are more likely to find shelter, or be put temporarily into a motel room, or couch surf.) Because of this, even official figures that include records of thousand of homeless people aren't actually accurate. They will always undercount the homeless.

Water is a huge blessing in parts like that u can often get really good water bottles at thrift stores and fill those up with water and ice , sun hats, sanitary items, sometimes just having someone ask if their ok helps a great deal. U have to be careful because cops will harass you. I‚Äôve been threatened and pulled over because I‚Äôve offered food, water basic things that we need to live and have been stoped. Holding your ground, and educating the police has been my greatest weapons trying to reach their humanity and being empathetic. I agree with u whole heartedly that seeing my fellow man suffer breaks my heart.
h7qa1h,funecy8,,Homeless people especially have complicated, individual needs. Theres no one size fits all solution.  Something that has been received well in my area is a local organization puts out boxes or lays out food, other items, and sometimes small amounts of cash in a few spots, where people know to look for it.   Especially in response to COVID shut down for the people that got left out without shelter or got kicked out of shelter, and got left behind by the mainstream homeless service providers in the area.
h7qa1h,fw0fwfm,,I'm homeless here in Phoenix, and any of these are some not so often thought of items that are constantly wanted, used, sought after by homeless people. Nothing has to be too fancy obviously, they're not the basic necessities. But you'd make a homeless persons month if you got them stuff like this  BACKPACKS!!!!! (Goodwill)  Drink mixes to flavor water  Baby wipes to clean body with  Pocket knifes or switchblades, pepper spray  Paint markers  Portable chargers  Flashlight  Lights to go on bikes (law at night, people get stopped by police all the time for this unfortunately)  Bikes and bike accessories, tire sealant, bike rack etc  Bluetooth speakers  Aluminum foil  Any old, unlocked smart phone that at least can connect to WiFi
h7qa1h,,fwdspdb,This is exactly what I'm looking for!!!!!!! Thank you! Sorry for the late reply. This will be my mission!  May I ask though... Paint markers and tin foil? What are the uses for these? I imagine the foil is good for a variety of things but paint markers? I've heard things like sometimes markings can describe where is safe and where to avoid. Is this the use?! Thats awesome honestly if so. A secret code hidden in plain sight!
h7qa1h,,fwi2asd,Paint markers can write on anything and a lot of people draw on things (graffiti), their stuff, make signs, etc. I guess no different than a permanent marker, but paint markers specifically are popular.  The foil is unfortunately for drugs, as smoking heroin and blues is so common. It has many uses like food storage, but I included it for the drug use. The fact is, they will use drugs regardless, the foil isnt an enabler, but it will give them less reasons to go steal it from a store or use dirty/used foil from trash cans like they do now. Sort of like needle exchange programs out there.   I think the best thing to help homeless people that you don't see much of is the bikes. A bike can improve a person on the streets life in hundreds of ways at once
h7qa1h,fumwnh5,,A really welcome gift, although kind of pricey, would be a USB power bank for recharging cell phones.  It's hard to find a place to plug in every day.   A power bank can last a week or more, or sustain a large group for a day.

h17mhf,ftqy6m0,,Cool. Thanks for sharing Jack!
h17mhf,g1l7aw1,,These people are trash. I used to work there and watched it all. They treat the homeless like they‚Äôre doing a personal service to them by feeding, housing and clothing, but this article is absolutely accurate. There is no autonomy and anyone who enters has to play by their ‚ÄòChristian‚Äô rules.  They have a process too. Of course, there is the daily food and shelter situation, but they also gauge which men will be suitable to be part of their transition program. From there, they live at the building and perform menial daily tasks like cleaning and sometimes working in the kitchen. But they‚Äôre also required to participate in service. After being there for a while, they get to move to the farm in Wellington or over to the main building. There they go through something like a year of transition, but are again forced to go to services if they want the help. If they don‚Äôt participate, they‚Äôre kicked out.  Much of the programs are run by chaplains that don‚Äôt have experience with substance abuse rehab or even mental health issues. Many of them are ‚Äògraduates‚Äô of their program.   And God forbid you‚Äôre gay. I once sat in a meeting where the HR director essentially said they were exempt from discriminating against homosexuals because they were a faith based org.   I can share a ton more, but just thinking about this place and those people again makes my blood boil. Fuck DRM
h0bq71,ftlcstl,,The shit that people feel free to do to homeless people that they would never try and get away with doing to a housed person is disgusting. It gets old. I had a lady just yesterday stop and just stare at me and keep watching me for the whole time I was just sitting and minding my own business. I felt like telling her to take a picture. WTF.
h0bq71,,ftnvurl,I was exiting a grocery store parking lot a few months ago and houseless woman was panhandling. I watched this truck in front of me throw actual TRASH at her and called her a loser. I was so angry I pulled up next to him at the stop light ready to just lay into him verbally. He looked like the kind of guy who would hit me (I‚Äôm a younger female). I decided me yelling at him wouldn‚Äôt change his attitude. So I drove around the block back into the parking lot, got out of my car and walked up to the woman he threw trash at. She was just sobbing. I gave her $20 and told her that I saw what happened and she didn‚Äôt deserve that. No one deserves that.
h0bq71,,ftonuu5,Thanks for doing that. You might have made the difference in how things went for her for a long time - maybe even saved her life. Why are people so cruel?
h0bq71,,ftmwca6,Take a picture of her and tell her the government has a file on her. Paranoid people will freak out. She sounds like one of those. If that does not get her to move on then tell her the New World Order is watching her.
h0bq71,ftlje8l,,Unfortunately some people are dumb as shit. Sorry you had to deal with that.
h0bq71,ftlre8i,,Police shouldn‚Äôt have come in the first place. That dispatcher is also to blame.

h0bq71,,fwzg7gp,America is a failed State.
h0bq71,ftm5eql,,Is this real life?
h0bq71,,ftmbjot,This is all too real. People often think a homeless person shouldn't have a cell phone, a laptop, etc. It seems to not ever occur to them that it might be what's left of our old life and not something we blew a few hundred dollars on instead of paying rent this month -- and never mind that the cost of a cheap laptop or cell phone absolutely will not cover rent in most places in the US.
h0bq71,,ftmc880,Still, it blows my mind. I guess the people who think this of the homeless must not have much of a support system. I bought and pay for my mother's phone and phone bill, respectively. Although not homeless, she is significantly poor and living on limited assistance (long story).  So, yeah...it's totally believable that the homeless have *some* material possessions. Anyone that thinks otherwise is quite daft.  Oh, and that lady in OP's story clearly has far too much free time on her hands.
h0bq71,,ftmd6s2,I was homeless for several years and making money online. So I usually had a laptop or tablet and spent most of my time at the library so I could plug in and get on free wifi.  Being homeless is hard on tech, so my tech got busted and replaced somewhat regularly. Every time I had a "new" (even if used) laptop or tablet, it got more complaints at the library about smelling or some bs excuse to try to get me thrown out.  I suspect some folks do shit like that in part out of jealousy or something. Or maybe "classism" is a better word for it -- this idea that poor people shouldn't be allowed to ever have anything "nice."  They seemed to interpret my leptop as a personal indulgence rather than a necessity for trying to earn some dough and get my life back. You can't even job hunt these days without a phone number and internet access. These are essentials for trying to get your life back. Even fast food places have signs everywhere saying "We're hiring! Apply ONLINE."
h0bq71,,ftocq59,I completely agree with you about classism. It's unfortunate these people exist, and worrying that we seem to have a big crop of them right now. The ignorance is astounding. I wonder if humanity is dividing.
h0bq71,,fwzgdta,It absolutely is divided in many ways, and those divisions are used to manipulate society into factions that fight each other instead of the real villains.  America is a failed State.
h0bq71,,ftm7zl4,Yes
h0bq71,ftodsda,,If I saw that I would get involved and try to educate her without dragging you into the mess. Maybe she would learn something if she was shown people disapprove of her thought process AND the police told her she was wrong. Some people just need really strong instruction before they start thinking. She may need to learn about basic things also. Most likely it would end in her having a fit, because if the ideas of a fearful and inflexible thinker are challenged they don't have a reality structure. I'm sorry that happened and no one backed you. I'm pissed with you, she sounds incredibly...I just don't have the words. It's wrong and she should have SOME awareness.

You can't sleep in the park, otherwise you'll get a ticket. Want to try a back alley? That's private property and a heftier ticket or straight to jail depending on the cop. Try the woods, we can't see you there and don't give a shit. But beware, if you're on someones property they can shoot you for trespassing.      The mentality of, "I don't care where you sleep but it can't be here" is disgusting. The fact that the homeless in any given area isn't thought of as a part of that community is disgusting. The fact that everything is being done to make homelessness illegal is disgusting. And the fact that government money went towards making sure the homeless didn't have a dry/somewhat safe place to sleep because they might been seen by \*gasp\* the public is mother fucking disgusting. Because they don't care enough to try and house and support the homeless, the least they could do is not actively try to make the lives of the homeless worse.
gzazmv,,ftje1bi,> Try the woods, we can't see you there and don't give a shit. But beware, if you're on someones property they can shoot you for trespassing.  Castle doctrine only applies to your *home* (the 'castle'). You can't shoot someone outside the home (or its close confines) unless they pose a reasonable threat to you. Certainly, a property owner can call the police to remove you, but they can't shoot you.  Also, the overwhelming majority of privately owned forests are owned by institutions (such as railroad and power companies) that don't spend much time patrolling that land and absolutely are not going to have what security personnel they do have using firearms on homeless people.  The worst you'll experience is that unattended stuff will be thrown away or you'll be asked to leave.  > Because they don't care enough to try and house and support the homeless, the least they could do is not actively try to make the lives of the homeless worse.  It's not about 'caring'. It's about homelessness being an incredibly difficult problem to solve.  Many those you might term the 'visible' homeless can't be helped except by restrictive institutions - think prisons and mental hospitals - because they lack the ability to function as an independent adults in the community.
gzazmv,,ftjkhr6,>unless they pose a reasonable threat to you  And what constitutes a reasonable threat? We know going on a run could be considered, why not sleeping in a tent? I work as an outreach coordinator and my job is literally to connect the homeless with services.  I do know that this is a difficult problem to solve, but I also know we could save money and help millions if we build permanent supportive housing for those who "lack the ability to function as an independent adults in the community. " But what about those on disability who CAN function but don't have the funds to live in an apartment. There are so many types of homeless and to play it as, well they can't be housed because they can't live independently, is inherently incorrect and just continues the belief that most homeless have some sort of mental health issue.  I would also like to bring up the people who live in the communities I work in who shoot the homeless with BB's or set tents on fire. I constantly have people yelling at me because I am just enabling the homeless or because they don't need help. If they're willing to spit on me, what lengths are they willing to go to remove a homeless person from their sight?  Permanent supportive housing helps everyone from those who need help to function to those on disability or retirement funds who don't have the money for a normal apartment. But no one wants them built near them because they don't want the homeless near them, even if it means they would be housed. Not to mention my favorite people who feel if the homeless get discounted housing then so should they. The homeless get free meals then so should I.     And so, I repeat:  >" The mentality of, "I don't care where you sleep but it can't be here" is disgusting. The fact that the homeless in any given area isn't thought of as a part of that community is disgusting. The fact that everything is being done to make homelessness illegal is disgusting.

gy8pjm,,ftcmeae,I've only done it once so far and it was a great experience, but it is a bit scary, yes. I think it helps that I've been an Airbnb host for over 10 years now (I'm a Superhost). I was one of the first hosts in Seattle. I'm definitely used to having ppl in the house, but with Airbnb, you are protected with their insurance and the person's ID and personal info is on file.   This is different since there isn't any "protection". But at the end of the day I do think most people are good. I also think most of us able to help often want to help, we just don't know how. Imagine if the fear of each other wasn't a factor... We'd live in a much better world.   I also think back to that scene in Titanic where the lifeboats never went back to get people out of the water because they were afraid. Was their fear justified? Maybe. Was it evil anyways? Absolutely. There are so many people 'drowning' around us in so many ways, and so many of us (myself included) standing around and watching, not because we don't want to help but because we're afraid of the what-ifs. At some point I decided to start taking baby steps in the right direction and get out of my comfort zone more and more.   I was at a Black Lives Matter march/demonstration today and my sign read: "If you've ever wondered what you would have done during slavery or Jim Crow, you're doing it now!" I would like to think that I would have been on the right side of history, but that would only be true if I have the courage to do "scary" or unpopular things, however small.

Not exactly safe.   I've been homeless before so I'm not exactly worried. My plan is to go for food stamps immediately, and then I don't know, wall around until a seasonal job opens up out west.

gxrnmr,ft4zc47,,Time to make a backup plan and get a small storage unit for your valuables that are worthless on the streets. Possessions are like anchors the more you have the slower you move and the less flexible you are. I am normally nomadic and move around but since covid I've been stuck in one spot and keep getting more and more stuff. I now have a homebum camp and I was tempted to pile everything up that I can't sell or cache and burn it all whilst dancing around the flames. But then I think of some other reason that I have to stay around here. But I'm not about to let this crap chain me down. I will take only what I had before covid and go back to being nomadic.
gxrnmr,,ft61fi9,What storage unit and how can I get one and don't you mean valuables that WORTH and why on the streets? I have a laptop, 2 luggage bags, a bicycle which I really want to try my best to keep with me even though it's a gift from someone, cooking pots, food and containers. I am ok with getting rid of the containers and food, would kinda want to try to keep the cooking pots and utensils with me and I really am 75 keep my bicycle and 25 letting it go if it really comes to the point and I DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP MY 2 luggage bags and especially my laptop with me because my laptop is very exensive and my luggage bags is a house to me. They store my clothes, toiletries, stationeries, documents and everything. Rick are you homeless in the UK?
gxrnmr,,ft87rcs,No, I'm in the U.S.  Keep your bicycle if you don't have a car. Get a good lock for it and a tool kit. What you will wanna do is get a rear bike rack for your bike and cable tie a small crate to your handlebars. Try to get panniers or do what I did and make some out of cable ties and plastic sign board. And you will want a medium sized non external frame backpack. My personal favorite is the 511 tactical 72hr assault pack. When you get going fast a big frame hiking pack acts like a parachute and makes you unstable on a bike.   To store your stuff I'm sure that the UK has places to rent a small storage space. I will check and edit if I don't get sidetracked. Edit: there's a place called metro storage and 3D storage both places are in London U.K. Just Google map search storage in your area. If you don't know how to, you must learn because you will be doing it alot homeless.
gxrnmr,,ft98kjg,Wow! I am marveled. You sound like a veteran homeless or ex homeless person and a veteran in surviving as a homeless. I understand what you are saying Rick but I really want to try my best even if I must beg on the streets to survive and pay for my rent every month. I really want to try the best to not be homeless whether my asylum claim will be decided or not decided by early August or early September. Life is so suffering!!! Going to heaven would be easier...... No suffering and no homelessness at all;(
gxrnmr,,ft9cgod,I've been homeless 11 years now.
gxrnmr,,ft9cok1,Oh my goodness!!!!! I can't imagine that. I don't think I am strong to survive that. I don't have that personality, nature or character to survive homelessness for that long. If I go through that challenge, I am not sure if I can survive. You are probably stronger than me. How do you have internet access?
gxrnmr,,ft9di7g,I have a phone with unlimited internet. I have power packs and a small solar panel to keep it charged. I panhandle to get the money to pay for the service.
gxrnmr,,fta53k3,Do you live and sleep in parks? Can people sleep in parks at a certain timeframe and are there 24/7 parks to sleep in in the US? Unfortunately in the UK or where I am, it's hard finding parks that you can live and sleep in and where you won't be in trouble.
gxrnmr,,ftb16bt,Just walk around and try to find a hidden spot with a roof. Best is it's hard to get to. There are lots of those in any city. If you don't have anything you can sleep at a big train station or airport for one night if you look like a normal traveler. You can get a 1qm storage box for like 10 - 20 pounds per month. Also get a inflatable pillow. If you put that under your hip you can sleep very comfortable on concrete. And you need a proper sleeping bag for cold temperatures.  Get a cheap prepaid phone card for calls. You can get open wlan and energy outlets in libraries or mcdonalds, etc..  There are homeless helping services in most citys where you can get free or very cheap food.  Homelessness is most of all very boring.
gxrnmr,,fta4t99,Oh I see.... I consider begging for money to survive some times too but I don't have the boldness and it could probably be because I never do this kind of thing before and beg to survive before. Damn! I pray God will provide an alternative solution for me lest I may really come to the point where I need to beg to survive and provide for my needs like you too.
gxrnmr,,ftd2ky2,Just picture them in their underwear.
gxrnmr,,ftd40o2,Not helping Rick.
gxrnmr,ft5f1br,,Why do you want to be in England. Most asylum seekers hate their new country.
gxrnmr,,ft61pl7,Because that's safest, fastest and one of the best options to claimed asylum and escape the BIG HELL I was in in that very evil tormenting country.
gxrnmr,ft84ne7,,I'm in the U.S. so am unable to help. I am so so sorry, you must be terrified. I really hope something works out for you. Stay strong, friend
gxrnmr,,ftdwsh9,You can help me if you can donate some money to me. Anyway, thank you for encouraging me.
gxrnmr,,ftpcrbe,isn't it also a bit weird asking random people to just send you money.  how about you start a gofundme page - put up a picture of yourself and insert a story so people know what youre going through.  Once it is up, post the link here. I am sure the good people of reddit will vet it and donate.
gxrnmr,,fum67pj, No I don't see that way. This is how I am:)
gxrnmr,g5gwjov,,Contact the charity Shelter 0300 330 1234  or St. Mungo's 0203 856 6000  Both are equipped to help you with your situation. I am a support worker for homelessness in a neighbouring area and work closely with both.  You can also look at spareroom.co.uk for a room in a  property but you may struggle to find anything given your asylum situation, as until this is settled you have no recourse to public funds, so cannot access benefits.   There are pockets of funding available for those in your situation, best bet is contact both charities to see what is available in your area as it varies.   Good luck my friend!

gwuy5p,fsxiivr,,Thank you for making my night.  From what I read in other posts, working at amazon:  1. stay hydrated 2. stretch  Keep your family informed on your ups/downs and keep looking for more resources to improve your situation. People are more inclined to help those that the see are at least doing something to help themselves. Maybe even sit down with family/people to write down goals/bullet points that you want to reach by certain dates.
gwuy5p,fsxha05,,So happy for you, that is so awesome!!!! Work will have awesome days, and not awesome days, and sometimes maybe your paycheck will be fucked up and sometimes maybe somebody microwaves their lunch fish in the microwave, but you have a job and you‚Äôre making progress, hooray!

gw82nb,fsts51l,,For wipes, I suggest the Assurance adult wipes. They are larger than a washcloth, come in a pack of 96 and work well for in between clean ups.
gw82nb,,fsuzscu,How much? I'll look for these at Walmart. I got some SUNBURN wipes, because I promptly gave myself the worst sunburn of my life, like an idiot. They're cooling with aloe, might be good on a hot day as well. 30 wipes for a a dollar from Dollar Tree here in Florida.
gw82nb,,fsv07hh,They are around $5 in Walmart. You‚Äôll find them near the Depends. They‚Äôre called disposable washcloths, they clean better than baby wipes.
gw82nb,,fsv0i81,I'm gonna go get some right now. I definitely need something like this. Thank you this invaluable tip.
gw82nb,fstrrk5,,u/LiliacDreams u/marlborofag  Okay so for my cooking set up the first thing that should be noted is that I am in a truck and thus have a tailgate, giving me essentially a counter to work on thats at perfect height for cooking. If you dont have a truck, itll be more complicated to get it going but its not impossible. If youre handy and have the time/money/compulsion Ive seen people on r/vandweller and r/overlander build some impressive pull out drawers that can house your cooking apparatus and your workspace.   Now, the place you want to visit is your local camping section at Walmart. You may have to visit multiple ones depending on selection, but what youre looking for are the Coleman Camp Stoves.  Theres a couple different ones, but the one I currently use is the three burner EvenTemp. It doesnt give me a lot of flame control but it isnt hard to accomodate for when cooking on it.   Another option is the smaller, single burner stove which works well, but can be annoying if you want to cook anything more complicated than a one pot/pan dish.   In between these are some double burner stoves and some more conventional looking grills, which work okay but if you find it, Id go with the 3 burner. Its more convenient and has battery powered igniters which is nice, but still also works being lit by a match or lighter.   These stoves run on gas canisters. The singler burner runs on a small can that looks like a spray paint can and the bigger stoves run on a green bottle. Alternatively if you want to carry around propane you can find adapters in the Garden area where they keep all the grilling accessories.   And beyond these stoves are also larger, propane run ones like the Blackstone and Camp Chef stoves, which are awesome, but can be inconvenient. Im eyeing up the Camp Chef myself (or more likely an online ordered better version) but thats because I want to have access to its accessories like a grill box and a much bigger flattop. But, these are wholly unnecessary.   The three burner can set you back about $100, but if you want to stay budget friendly the single burner is still about $20. Fair warning, dont get the small JetBoil like ones. They burn super hot but arent really for normal cooking.  Gas meanwhile costs about 1-3 a can depending on sales; definitely try to get packs of them instead of singles.   Once you have that sorted, youre 1/3 of the way there.   Next you want to visit the kitchen aisle. Just to start out with, try to get a knife (The Thyme and Table 3pc sets are pretty good for $10 knives), a cutting board, a mixing bowl set, a wooden spoon, tongs, a spatula and a slotted and a closed metal or plastic spoon. Its a lot but these are the dead basics you'll want to have. Depending on what you want to make though, you can skip some of this until later. Just want hot dogs? Just grab some tongs.   Next is your cooking surface. Currently I have a cast iron griddle pan, a small cast iron pan, and a largish stainless steel pan. Starting out you can just grab a nice nonstick, but I would highly recommend either cast iron or stainless steel. Cast iron takes some love to keep nice in this kind of situation, but its worth it.   For boiling water, I would recommend either a percolator (found in camping) or a kettle if you find one. Theyll be a bit more compact than large pots and easier to stow. Alternatively you can look at the pot/pan sets in camping, which are designed to be compact, but the quality can be shoddy. But while in camping, definitely pick up a mess kit. The combo plate/lid and bowl is highly useful.   For cleaning purposes, I recommend a mix of paper towels and washable rags. Use paper towels on larger messes then follow up with rags. I also keep a gallon jug with soapy water that I can splash into hot pans to clean them out.   Once you have that, all you need to decide is how youre going to deal with food. Ive tried two options:  Shopping for and cooking the food I wanted the day of.   Or.   Keeping coolers iced down and stowing food.   I currently do the latter, but Ive done the former as well. And with these I would say there isnt necessarily a right recommendation, as which you pick will depend on your budget, whats available to you, and what youre willing to deal with.   The former involves keeping on hand everything that doesnt need refrigeration and then just buying and cooking anything else you need that day. This is efficient if you're say meal prepping and have a fridge at work you can store your meals, or if youre cooking very simple meals that you dont need to have stuff stored for. And naturally, it saves a lot on buying ice.   For the latter however, it does open you up to a lot of different things (right now I can make burgers, hot dogs, quesadillas, several different types of pasta dishes, a couple different stews, and a couple rounds of American diner style breakfasts), but it does require having at least one large, somewhat not cheap cooler and keeping it iced down. I actually keep two coolers, one big one and one small one, with the small one holding drinks and milk so I can make bowls of cereal.   In my area, I have access to 24/7 ice machines that sell me 20lb bags of ice for $2.00 which makes it pretty economical to keep stuff iced down. Whats important however is how you initially set up your cooler and keeping to a refill schedule.  Initially, you want to have a thick layer of ice along the bottom of the cooler, then pack in what youre stowing. Ideally, you'll want to put everything in ziploc bags with the ziploc facing upwards. The last thing you want is for ice water to seep into a bag of cheese, but certain items like bottled or jarred stuff and raw produce can just hang out in the open. Once you have it arranged go ahead and fill in the rest with ice.  Now here Id recommend letting it sit overnight without opening it so the interior temperature equalizes, but you dont have to. When refilling, try to do it *after* you're done cooking for the day, so that way you dont have to open it more than you have to.   Meanwhile, keep to a strict refill schedule. You'll have to do some trial and error to figure out what schedule you need. For me, once its iced down I can go for three full days, opening it once or twice a day, and then refilling on the fourth. When refilling, you do want to drain the water, but unless its gotten dirty, leave a good amount of it at the bottom. This will help maintain the temperature of the cooler and will buy you an extra day or two in a pinch before things will start to get too warm.   Either way, once your ready you can go grocery shopping. Staple wise definitely want kosher salt and a black pepper grinder (the disposable McCormick ones are great), and either a neutral oil like vegetable or canola, or a good extra virgin olive oil. If you go cast iron, get the neutral oil to start with and get EVOO later.   Beyond those, you dont strictly need anything else, so just get stuff as it suits your fancy.   Now an important aspect of doing this is finding a place to cook. You kind of have to play it by ear, but its a similar process to finding a place to sleep. While you may get curious looks, as long as you follow the Dont be an Asshole rule, you shouldnt necessarily be bothered. That being said, try to angle things so that someone has to be right up on you to really know what youre doing. Where I usually cook, its right up against a group of trees that flanks a dumpster area, and is right in the corner of a busy parking lot. Never get bothered, only had one guy who saw I was cookingn and we had a nice chat about it; got good remarks on my stew lol.   And one last tip I can provide is that if youre worried about cops or in general just overstaying your welcome, consider hanging out in your potential spot for several hours, multiple days in a row. If you arent bothered (especially if youre up and about) you can reasonably assume you'll be okay.   But even so, you can also focus on making quick meals that let you set up, cook, and clean up in less than an hour. Definitely good idea to start out doing that until youre comfortable in a spot.   And lastly, this process of tailgating is generally legal in most cities, so unless your lot is prohibiting loitering its unlikely cops will bother you anyway. Not only is the lot I sleep in not such, but it also happens to almost never be prowled on by cops, day or night. (Which I do find strange given theres a bar in this lot too but oh well lol. Im not complaining) So if you can find such a goldilocks place, youre golden.    --  Thats it. Cooking is an unreal mental relief when youve been relying on fast food for an inordinate amount of time, and in general its a beautiful hobby to get into.
gw82nb,,fststc8,Wow. That really was detailed. Thank you for sharing! I honestly would have never considered, but it does seem beneficial. Eating fast food everyday does get tiring. I‚Äôm gonna save this post.   It seems like that bed really has a lot of potential for storage and cooking. Do you also have a sleeping setup back there?
gw82nb,,fstt3ea,Not yet. Why it took me this long to consider getting a topper for my truck is beyond my understanding but its my next mini life goal alongside an actual bed.   It is for sure going to revitalize how I live given I basically dont use the bed lol.
gw82nb,fstzbl4,,This is just great. Save and repost this about once a month. Here's hoping you get a solid place soon.
gw82nb,fsvp50k,,Great post!  Which 28 watt and handheld battery would your recommend?  Thanks
gw82nb,fsvzqv7,,This is great advice! I think there should be either a pinned post or something on the sidebar with a compilation of this information, broken down into categories/sections like ‚Äúliving in a car - safe places to park.‚Äù Everyone‚Äôs situation is different but with good organization people can quickly find the information that relates to them.  I recently became homeless living in my car (now day 5) and I wish I had a single document with all these life/living tips instead of trying to figure things out myself, it would save me so much trouble. It‚Äôs likely the situation/circumstances that made someone homeless is also likely hindering them from getting the info/help/resources to survive and ultimately bounce back - sometimes it‚Äôs the little things that can make or break you. How do we get something like this started?? Can any mods chime in and provide some insight to help make this a reality?   I pasted below a comment I wrote yesterday with everything I‚Äôve learned so far, there‚Äôs a lot of overlap with your post but I figure a different perspective doesn‚Äôt hurt!   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  - gym membership would be ideal when they reopen. but for now try finding your nearest truck stop, for a couple bucks you can take a shower and do laundry.  the area is safe and well lit so you also can park your car there overnight to sleep. some places don't allow cars (like where im at) but i just arrive at midnight and park on the side of the convience store - so far no one has bothered me.  - download all the fast food apps on your phone to get deals. burger king just finished having some national burger day and ive been eating free whoppers. I don‚Äôt know how to actually find food deals - I‚Äôve never used coupons for anything but I know there are people who never pay full price for anything. I‚Äôm still trying to learn how they do it.  - there are food banks and shelters but i have yet to explore them.  I‚Äôm currently surviving on fast food but that is already becoming too expensive. I know groceries would be cheaper but I never learned how to cook. Storing perishable food is another issue, one solution is ice box and ice but I‚Äôm not sure how cost effective that is ... there are still a lot of basic things I need to figure out.   - see if a friendly redditor can buy you a cigarette lighter adapter so you can plug in electronics like a laptop (if you have one) into your car. this is the best purchase ive made thus far  - keep your car clean and organized. you spend so many hours in there and the smell/trash/etc will build up and create a shit enviorment for you, making life 10x harder than it needs to be.  - there are a bunch of youtube videos about people who live out of their car very comfortably. i have yet to watch any but there is a ton of helpful information to explore  - ive had difficulty finding public wifi to use since libraries and places like starbucks are closed. for now ive been going to motels and sitting in the lobby to steal their wifi, if there is a password its usually "guest." If anyone asks I just say I'm here to meet a friend for a meeting and make up something up. If your a good conversationalist, you can try making friends with the front desk. i went to a motel yesterday and a sign said they are no longer serving contentinel breakfast and instead they send some "packaged goods" to your room. i just made conversation and asked what food they sent (it was granola bars) and managed to get a couple for free. little things can add up  - stay physically active, i try to run on trails at the park to get fresh air. this does however mean more showers which can mean more money if you have to pay. everything is cost vs benefit.  - 2 things to keep in mind: 1) people judge a book by its cover and 2) the rich get richer, the poor get poorer aka its expensive to be poor. so do your best not to look homeless and instead always make the effort to act professional. i traveled extensively for work and frequently would make friends at the bar who sometimes would offer if i wanted to stay at their house for the weekend just to show me the city. so start thinking from their perspective why they would make the offer - they know im already staying at hotel so its not like i desperately need a place to stay, plus I‚Äôm professional/executive level position/educated/upperclass/friendly/knowledgeable/etc. people are generally a good judge of character and will get involved in your life when they know the risk is low and benefit is high. show others you are an asset to them vs a liabiliy and people will gravitate towards you  - dont stop improving yourself. the stronger you become (mentally/physically/emotionally/etc) the more you can overcome. your today is not your forever.  - If I need something shipped to me I just put a hotel address and once I know it arrives, I go to front desk and pick it up. If they ask me ‚Äúare you staying at this hotel‚Äù I say no but my friend/colleague is and it‚Äôs his name on the box, I‚Äôm just picking it up because it materials for our corporate/business meeting, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all here visiting (name of city). Adding a bs company name on the package address line helps to make your story legit. I‚Äôve done this tons of times when I traveled for work and never had issues. Many times when I hadn‚Äôt booked my hotel yet but I needed to order/ship stuff now for it to arrive to my destination in time, I would pick a random hotel (minimum 3 stars) close to the event site and do exactly as I described above.   - Always be kind to others, treat everyone with respect, and if you have the means to help someone then do it - homelessness shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse to only take and not give. This week I‚Äôm going to visit the local food bank/shelter and volunteer, it‚Äôs a great way to make friends with those in charge and will give me a good perspective on how everything works. Having insider information and knowing the right people will give you an edge on anything you do, the hard part is training yourself to naturally think in that mindset. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúinsider information‚Äù looks like at a food bank/homeless shelter - it could be as simple as being friends with the administrator. Maybe one day the shelter is full and I desperately need a room - a single phone call to the right person can get me in. If it‚Äôs worked to help me get a seat at a packed/reservation only restaurant, then there‚Äôs no reason for it not to work at a homeless shelter. Take the extra effort to make friends in high places and as long as you are kind, respectful, and helpful you can be friends with anyone.  - these are other safe places ive found to park your car overnight, it helps to change locations so you can continue to go unnoticed: A) Visitor Lot in hospitals and if anyone asks say something like your sister is inside recovering from surgery and your waiting for your aunt to come back to the car. B) 24 Hour McDonalds, I‚Äôve done this on road trips and never had an issue C) I just found a nearby bus/train lot on google and the reviews say how it‚Äôs a good/safe/free place to keep your car overnight when carpooling, I‚Äôm planning to check it out tomorrow but these are keywords you can use to find similar places near you
gw82nb,,fsyxgna,I'd love to teach you about apps and couponing! It took me about 20% of my battery yesterday, but I got money maker Vaseline x 2, money maker moisturizer, and a free drink yesterday. Today, I will ideally do the same, along with a different money maker drink. Andddd repeat. A money maker is where they pay you more than you paid. It's totally possible, and there are more than a few apps for gig work too. Yesterday, I got $9 for taking pictures of batteries, and today, I'll get $7 for taking pictures of cig stuff. It all adds up.

gw82nb,,ft06xge,Your alternator does work when youre not driving but its much more efficient when youre moving (because its based on RPM and driving means more rpm).   So whether or not its okay just depends on whether youre draining more battery power than you are generating. Hard to say without getting a meter and monitoring it while you do this.   I personally dont like having to get jumped so i wouldnt risk it myself.   And as for A/C doing what you did is part of what made my A/C break all those years ago lol. May be mine was just on the way out anyway but even so.   Idk where you are but I would recommend trying to get used to your local weather, and leave the A/C for when youre driving or just when you cant take it anymore. Thats helped by keeping your windows open as much as possible.   You can also get some small battery powered fans that, while they dont last long, can help promote a cross breeze in your vehicle so youre at least not stuck with stale air.   And it should be obvious but find shade. Staying out of the sun is the best way to not die of heat, and staying in the sun is funnily enough the best way to beat the cold.
gvzyit,fsry8h6,,I want people to know that i feel ashamed of going to reddit with this
gvzyit,,fsxlshh,Don‚Äôt feel bad. Everyone needs a sympathetic ear at times. It may not have been the best choice of sub, but I hope things work out for you.
gvzyit,fsxt1n2,,I‚Äôm sorry, dude. I thought Sweden had a really solid social welfare system though? Like I could have sworn they had a guaranteed basic income or something that you can get even if you just voluntarily don‚Äôt work? But obviously I don‚Äôt know the Swedish aid system as well as a Swede and maybe I‚Äôm mixing it up with a different country.  Anyway, what about asking your fans/supporters, who believe in you as a gamer, to crowdfund assistance for a bit? Especially until your tournament is over. Do you do Twitch? Isn‚Äôt that a semi-viable source of income for high quality gamers?   Sorry I don‚Äôt have more/better advice, but I‚Äôd definitely look into support options from your government and from the gaming community.

gv8ea1,fso8c26,,Ask the national guard sergeant if he can spare some MRE's, Meal Ready to Eat.  Get a plain sponge and a micro fiber towel at Dollar Tree. Fill a two liter bottle with water. Find a small bottle like a 5 hour energy bottle. Wash it out and fill it up with soap at a public toilet sink.   Find a private spot and wash yourself.  Look in a mattress store for heavy mill plastic mattress covers. The single bed size makes a decent tube tent. Larger covers can be cut to size and make an A frame tent. You will need some cordage for the ridge line. Sam's club has a box of twine just outside the door for people to use for tying the trunk shut or to tie things to the roof of the vehicle. You need about 50 feet. You can also collect cordage and strapping from dumpsters and along the road sides.  Use a small stone in the corners and sides of the plastic and tie a loop around it, two half [hitches](https://www.animatedknots.com/complete-knot-list), and tie the other end around a tree, stone or a wooden stake you make with a knife from a branch. I sometimes use chop sticks from the Chinese restaurants.
gv8ea1,,fsol4zg,All excellent advice.

gv8ea1,fsnkxp6,,How can I help? Do you have access to a Venmo or PayPal to send you some money to help get you to a safer place? Or maybe just an email so I can send some sort of e-gift card?
gv8ea1,,fsp85t7,If you really want to help, western union is often the best choice for people with no bank accounts.  Assuming the receiver has a valid id from any state, anyone can send them money to be picked up. Maybe message op and see if that is something they would be interested in and thanks for being a nice person.
gv8ea1,,fspa60n,Thanks for the info! I appreciate it!
gv8ea1,fsnq5mx,,Stay on the move, keep your head low, stay out of trouble, and keep to yourself at night.   Stay in touch with local community churches and organizations for food and other resources. Meanwhile, find a quiet spot to hunker down at night away from the center of the city and do everything early in the day as soon as curfew rises. Then use the later half of the day to work your way back to your spot.   Right now, just make sure you're eating everyday and hydrating. Everyday focus on those things and energy will clear for other pursuits. Practice positive self talk. It really does makes a difference! The unfolding of the world warps around your overall attitude and mental frame.  I know things are tough, but you're a champion! Remind yourself of that whenever you forget it.
gv8ea1,fso6hiv,,I don't know about other cities, but the curfew order in Omaha,  NE, specifically says HOMELESS are not affected by the curfew order.
gv8ea1,,fso797r,It's a fucked-up situation. I don't know who to be more afraid of - the police or the other people. Homeless people are caught in the middle. I just want to be left alone.
gv8ea1,,fsodb34,I‚Äôd be careful around the police. Rioters are trying not to get caught, police just will indiscriminately fuck you up for being there.
gv8ea1,,fso9htm,If I were homeless, I would definitely be more afraid of the rioters right now, especially if you happen to be white. I know it's a shitty circumstance, but hang in there. Do you have a PayPal? I might can move my budget around and spare some coin.
gv8ea1,,fsqt0jp,Thanks. But I think all you might be able to do is buy me food from somewhere.
gv8ea1,,fsr0d8a,Probably the only thing you can do is buy me some food from somewhere.
gv8ea1,,fsq2109,Yeah, this. Are you sure the curfew applies to you in your city? That's super fucked up. The cities around here exclude people experiencing homelessness.
gv8ea1,fsobvt5,,Get out of the city, get into the woods. Take a bath in a river or lake. Food will be a little harder to get if you're totally reliant on soup kitchens or what not but if you've got stamps then you should be ok. I suggest getting out of the city because the next step is likely gonna be city/regional lockdowns. You don't want to be stuck inside the walls when that happens.
gv8ea1,fsnlidf,,You should get out of the city while you can. Try the forest.
gv8ea1,,fsp7k6c,I'm right out of town in the forest bordering BLM if you have access to a spot local I would  highly recommend it. Most of my neighbors including myself do not mind good humans doing human things and some of us have been very close to homeless and will allways be 1 paycheck or 5 away from the same situation. We are in this together.
gv8ea1,fsoszsj,,I've been telling people to get out of cities for months now.
gv8ea1,fso1b3u,,This is the beginning of the end. This age is passing away, behind we are entering something new. Fret not. Raise the frequency of your vibration by focusing on positive things. Keep the color purple around you. AVOID THE NEWS at all costs. Spread love and peace. Be amongst the peacemakers, for they shall be blessed.   If you have a car or van, you are beyond blessed. Keep sheltered and hidden. By hidden i mean do not go near large crowds. Keep your eating and drinking as healthy and minimal as possible. The less you eat and drink, the less you will have to dispose of waste.   Buy jugs of water and keep a cloth. Wash with water only every few days. As long as you are not crawling in filth, you will be okay.   Practice good hygiene and sacred cleanliness, meaning, have spaces for waste, waste, and dirty items or trash and a separate space for Clean items. Stay off the internet as much as possible. Write as much as possible to yourself. Find pieces of water and write personal prayers or affirmations to yourself.  I am currently living and traveling in my truck. The most important thing we can do now is not fall prey to the division and strife and destruction that we see going on. I know it may sound corny to some, but those of you who will hear, let them hear. If you are homeless at this point in time, count it a blessing. Count all of your blessings. now is a time to raise the frequency of your vibration. Fear and violence comes from a low vibrational frequency. Do not succumb. These riots are a setup. Do not fall prey.

gunkwx,fsl0y1h,,Google Freecycle and join for free. You find your city  and area.  There is an offer side that people are giving away stuff and and wanted side.  So post your "want" and maybe a bit if your situation and post it. People are very generous on this site and I can almost guarantee you will get what you need.

gunkwx,fsjpjrt,,What about a Craigslist ad asking if anyone has what you need. If you are spanging or flying a sign you could write your needs on your sign. There are definitely lots of poles and tents sitting idle in garages across the country. Be careful about fishing without a license (you could put that on your sign too).  The biggest tip I can give is to keep reminding yourselves that there is nothing  wrong with being homeless. In fact by doing so, you are using very few resources; you are very light on the earth. Anyone who looks down on you is a nasty person and doesn't deserve your time. There is nothing wrong with asking for help. If you've ever had a job, you helped someone else out. And remember that you're not asking for much. You're needing a little boost is all.  Are you in an urban area? If so, you'll find community meals, etc; internet search will get you to those. If not, do some searches about what to forage in your area and generally start practicing always looking around for stuff to eat; fruit trees, etc. Don't forget about vitamins, proteins and fiber. Springtime is great for foraging because so many of the plants are still tender shoots. I found some cattail shoots last week and they were like salad greens.   Check out r/vagabond for traveling and camping tips. Head up, shoulders back and enjoy your adventure. You are free!
gunkwx,,fsjq2l2,That's a great idea I'm going to go do this now lol. Also in this state we can fish with no license from the bank. And thank you so much for the kind words it really hit me in the feels. The food places here are further than we can get to right now because we lost our car.

gu1448,fsfor0p,,I hate motorcycles so much. So dangerous. I know far too many people who were injured or killed by one or on one. So many irresponsible people who fly on them and don‚Äôt take proper precautions, and then tons of people who don‚Äôt pay attention to motorcycles and even the responsible drivers are at higher risk of injury or death. Unpopular opinion, perhaps, but I personally hate them. Just hearing the ‚Äúrevving‚Äù of a motorcycle flying up behind me makes me cringe.   RIP LAMAR
gu1448,,fsfq24v,I will say, there are def unsafe motorcyclists. But, per capita, car drivers are far worse. Think about it for a sec. If u fuck up on a motorcycle, you can die easily, so riders mostly are going to be more careful. Even if you hit a piece of debris or even another human (rip Lamar), you may die. Now contrast that to a car driver, who doesn't have to be aware of as many things (by far). This results in ppl driving not really paying a whole lot of attention, and causing all kind of accidents by comparison to bikers.  That said, sorry about your buddy. I hope you can find forgiveness for the universe in your heart. Bless you, dude.
gu1448,,fsfqe2b,Yeah, all vehicles are definitely unsafe and you‚Äôre right about ppl paying less attention in cars. My opinion is definitely biased as I‚Äôve had so many friends and loved ones die or get injured on motorcycles throughout my life, far more than normal car accidents. I also witnessed a horrible and motorcycle accident while I was playing in the yard as a young child and it probably traumatized me. I saw things I wouldn‚Äôt want to see as an adult.

gtg4yt,fsbcvdb,,This is the underlying problem, juries. Juries won't convict. They look at cops and see someone like themselves...clean shaven, uniform, moral. Then they look at the homeless and see trash, filth, and disease.    They don't look at the homeless and think there but for the grace of God go I. They look at the homeless and see something they would rather not think about at all. So they don't.
gtg4yt,,fsbk40j,[deleted]
gtg4yt,,fscnxav,What about jury selection? I know sometimes background is factored into the definition of peer. Could it be illegal to have a jury, none of which have been homeless, passing judgment on a homeless person?
gtg4yt,fsbd4n8,,My friend Johnny was obviously murdered out here. The police never investigated it. His skull was crush just above the back of the neck. His body was covered up with debris and placed in a creek near some tunnels that run under a two main cross streets. His body was between two concrete structures that help keep out debris from the tunnels. There was no rain that could have covered his body like it was found. It would be impossible that his body was covered by debris. It was intentional. The police often will avoid investigations into homeless deaths. I had heard this before from people on the street. Now I‚Äôve actually experienced this on my own. This happened about two years ago..anniversary. I was the only person to actually investigate this death.I was the only person to care and not even his mother cared. I talked to the woman who found his body. I pleaded with the police and even gave them the name of suspect that may have murdered him. I was told angrily that it‚Äôs not a suspicious death. I still see the suspected murderer on the streets. This killer is a beautiful homeless woman which makes it all the more surreal.
gtg4yt,fsc9ly4,,The people protesting are fighting for equality and justice for George Floyd. They're rioting because peaceful protest wasn't cutting it in the last couple of years. And the only way to express their anger is looting (not condemning it at all), burning buildings and vandalizing. Other than derrick chauvin who was charged with 3rd degree murder and manslaughter (Should have been 1st degree). The other 3 should have been charged as well because they stood there and watch his fellow officers kill that poor soul. Be careful out there, if you're in LA avoid downtown la until justice is served to those 4 fucking disappointing cops.

There are also homeless men who will tell be jealous and angry at you because they perceive that somehow we have it easier because we have a vagina and that gives us more opportunities and choices when we have an inherit money maker. It's all really sad and disgusting.
gsa883,,fs4w01y,Thank you for replying I'm new to all this. that's beyond fucked! Tricking for food because you're starving is the worst place to be on top of someone being jealous that you were forced in that situation. It's so bleak for people who fall behind the curtain.
gsa883,,fs71zg8,I don‚Äôt understand this. Where are people that they can‚Äôt go to a charity? In every town there is some well meaning church giving out food. When I begged for Money or was to get inside for awhile or for health products, pens, ect. Do people actually not have places near them with food? How can you guys actually be hungry for long? I‚Äôm really asking, sorry if I seem ignorant o have been on the streets many times and not run into this?
gsa883,,fs769b3,It's kinda hard to figure to get to charities when you have no ride and you're out of the city limits.
gsa883,,fs76kps,Understanding you have less options out there. Are there any churches near you, or temples of any kind?
gsa883,,fs772sy,Not any that's open.
gsa883,,fs77sy9,Ah. I hear you. Okay, 2nd idea since you have internet access (and by no means do I think I know better then you, just throwing out options since I‚Äôve slept and I know how hard it is) do any of the churches or temples near you have a website or Facebook or email? You maybe could email or contact them asking for help. Many are mandated by their beliefs to help. Someone might throw you a freakin bone. More likely they give you the runaround ( I have received this version of ‚Äúhelp‚Äù many times) but what have you got to lose? I would try to help, but I don‚Äôt know you or your area. Try all religions you can find online. I‚Äôve seen some actual help given. It‚Äôs rare. Best of luck.
gsa883,,fsbjcx4,I  have clients who would really benefit from the food programs being offered in our downtown core however due to prior criminal activity they are banned from that area. I have a feeling there are quite a few people who are completely unserviced because by law they cannot enter the areas where the service is actually provided. I hope that sheds some light on the reason why someone may not be able to access food. Obviously not everyone is a criminal but that is one possible scenario.   Another possible scenario is that the people hanging around the food program may not be safe choices for someone to  be near. I also know people who are desperately trying to stay clean. They know their triggers and will avoid at all costs. If your dealer happens to be hanging around the food program you may be inclined to not participate in that service.    The other big one here as to why someone may not be able to access food : plain and simple not every community has a vibrant and active food program. The county that I work for has four main areas. Only one of those areas is well serviced. I have people living in remote bushes miles from any other humans. When they're hungry they are truly starving.  Hope that helps bring some understanding here.
gsa883,,fsc6c31,I think this covers a lot of ground. Especially good to post stuff like this since some come to this sub saying it‚Äôs all so easy. I know it‚Äôs not easy, having been there. I just had not seen any area so remote as to not have any churches. Thanks.

gsa883,,fs3wzj4,Weirdest feeling ever. It happened to me 3 times in my first 2 years in the San Francisco Bay area without a car. One guy looked like a gang banger with corn rows offering me weed then drove to a dead end and said he wanted to blow me. I'm a guy.

gsa883,,fs59yi0,I think it‚Äôs weird because they are being propositioned because they are in a vulnerable position and the propositioner assumes the person is desperate. Typically people don‚Äôt proposition each other in a bar environment without any inkling of which way the person swings. Maybe I am reading it wrong but it does feel weird to me.
gsa883,,fs7lla8,It's weird because it's never happened to me before.
gsa883,,fs5pk87,It always counts, no matter how weird
gsa883,fs5iwdj,,Yeah, it's common.  Back in my taxi days, a lot of the unscrupulous drivers would prey on the street peeps for sex/food transactions.  Assholes.  I was propositioned a few times.  One asked me to buy her a mcHamburger [$1.00] for a blowjob.  I bought her a big mac combo and gave her a ride across town for free.  Some people suck, but not all.  Stay safe.
gsa883,fs620xv,,i hope he gets hit by a car

gsa883,,fs6algs,I had about 3 months on the street but luckily I was working and had a car to live in. I'm sure horrible things would've happened if I didn't have my car.   I hate to think of how horrible people can be. Internet hugs to you.
gsa883,,fs72pd7,yeah, lots of predators out there. And places you would think were safe, they are like full of them. Glad you had a car, Im sure that is what saved you. Recently, I was living with a family in their RV.  I took care of the kids, cooked and things, after a few weeks, they had me out hooking, at first, no big deal, then they got more into drugs, stopped working and had me out there a lot...took me a couple of weeks of that before I was able to get away.  Just backed up my belief, don't ever trust anyone.
gsa883,,fs9gnih,I hope you have stopped allowing people to use and abuse you. They‚Äôre scum trying to take down drain with them
gsa883,,fsbmhow,I try, but it is how I survive now.  I will never let myself get that desperate again.
gsa883,,fsc1mmq,Listen, the only way any of us can survive is either plant our food or buy it. Since many don‚Äôt plant, they have to buy. In order to buy, we need money or having something to barter. I rather buy. Get a real job where the imbalance of you labor isn‚Äôt costing your body and soul. Start loving yourself. No amount of money is worth what their taking from you.
gsa883,,fs9usq3,well at least you got a warm meal first
gsa883,,fsblrel,you sound just like him, guess that is how you meet girls
gsa883,,fsdmanx,Don't sit here and the cap like you're some innocent little girl I went through your post history and your last post was a picture of your pussy covered with jizz and you were bragging about wedding a group of five different meth heads run a train on you. Honestly to me you just seem like a little hoarder who likes to be degraded I just hope after that guy finished busting a nut down your throat and all over your face for a sandwich she didn't give you anything to wipe off the stuff with and you just had to walk around the rest of the day looking like a little s***. If you're out there sucking dick for sandwiches you really send your standards pretty low I provided security and advertisement for an adult escort before and she wouldn't even consider going to meet a client unless you was getting at least $200 for an hour. At the rate you're going all the tread going to be worn off your pussy within the next 5 years and then you'll be selling gummies in the back alley behind CVS until you eventually choked to death on a guy's dick. I honestly feel kind of bad for you I would never ever let any of the girls who work for me leave to go with the trick unless they were making it at least 75 box for a 15 minute session
gsa883,,fsi1594,you sound like a typical wanna be pimp trying to talk up a game....been around guys like you, worked for a couple at one time....got away....now on my own and doing ok....thank you for asking.
gsa883,,fsjfoc1,Honestly I really hope the best for you I don't judge sex workers I consider it a job just like any other but if you don't start having your clients wear protection you're going to end up with but nasty STD possibly incurable and you're not going to be able to work again. You just have to know your worth. I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and tell you that you're a supermodel but you're a very attractive girl and you could be setting your standards a lot higher in life. If you're ever really in a rough spot and he needs some help you can just DM me your cash app and I will send what I can. Please just be safe out there
gsa883,,fsjmpzr,That was when I was first thrown out of the house, no friends who would help, no skills for what to do or how to survive.  l learned a lot, really fast.  Got set up by someone I thought I could trust.  Another thing I learned, don't trust anyone. Held for awhile, broken in, put on the street...took me awhile but I got away....
gsa883,fs6r9pc,,My ex-boyfriend said he gets propositioned a lot and mainly by guys in exchange for money, food, or a place to sleep. He's sort of gotten used to it :/ I'm sorry you experienced that, though. It's awful to know a person would only help you if they got something out of it. Ironically, that same ex only got with me because he wanted a place to stay at. Sucks to be used like that, I know ://
gsa883,,fs9h3vy,No one should ever have to get used to that. Those scum get away with it too
gsa883,fs4zomy,,Here in LA, even as a guy, you have to worry about that.... from other guys
gsa883,,fs5q750,Yes, seems like a backpack means you're down for a BJ (or more) some nights. WTF?
gsa883,,fs5rn1n,Who knows... I just know that gay men out here are exceptionally aggressive and predatory. Its happened numerous times where I've been propositioned. I'm not gay, and there isnt enough money to be offered for me to suck a dick.
gsa883,,fs5yi0h,I've only been hit on twice, both times when dark outside, seemed/looked normal when first addressed, then comes the proposition. "Uh, what? No thanks." and then hurriedly departed the area because they were in cars and I was walking.  Whatever they were offering never hit my ears because it was a non-starter to begin with. Getting the hell away was the only thing on my mind.
gsa883,,fs84e8y,I've never had somebody ballsy enough to try that I have had a couple guys try to pay me to suck my dick which for real shocked the s*** out of me LOL I can't have looked that good especially since I rarely had the chance to have a proper shower or a change of clothes but what do I know maybe there's a fetish in the gay community for 3 week old nut cheese LOL
gsa883,fs69zet,,I gave 20 bucks through cashapp to a woman in reddit, claims zhe is i could have been scammed. because shevsaid she had to do sexual favors. I was homeless too and I had a few guys want me to blow them for food. I felt like shit and vulnerable but I just told them off and left in a hurry.
gsa883,fs5pugq,,Hungry? BK is giving free whoppers away until 6/2 I got 1 already and locked up a few more. Check the post about it on this sub.
gsa883,fs7o7po,,Yea I was once flying a sign and a dude walked past me 3 times trying to offer me $100 to go back to his house. I made a scene the 3rd time and then he walked across the street and stared at me for the rest of the time I was there. I walked to my car and he CAME UP TO MY CAR to confront me or something idk. I freaked out, pulled my taser out of my glovebox, tased him and then gtfo
gsa883,,fs7oo2r,Good I'm glad you got out of that situation safely.

gsa883,fs5a03t,,I saw at the park where a lot of homeless people go in Florida such an occurrence. A woman was 'commanded' by a black man to come over to him. He began talking about how he was kicking out his roommate or something. He asked her after a bit of talking if she had a pussy. He wanted to get her in there, but not for free.  The same guy around two months ago when I first became homeless acted completely differently. Although he would consistently ask for money. He even made up a huge sob story about how he's some inventor and he's suing and asked for money. (Hint: a false self)
gsa883,fs71lep,,Happens a lot to women. At least he was upfront about it. My answer is always that if I did that, it would cost a lot more then dinner and then I laugh. Generally the guy goes away.

Just a thought.  Fuck trolls.

grk2rh,fs1g7lm,,I could peddle that monstrosity to the first mountain lol. I'm already homeless on an ebike pulling a trailer with my dog riding on it, and know a few things about this.   I could build something like this and have it electric as well but it would take a year. The main problem is weight, try riding that thing down a 10% grade and you will crash and possibly die. Bicycle brakes even hydraulic disc brakes aren't going to stop something more than 500 lbs down a mountain. Above 400 lbs and you need two electric motors or you will burn a single motor up. I thought about making a camper trailer for my bike but I'm at my braking limit as is and I have the biggest bicycle disc brakes you can get. Something like that can only be used in a flat area within a 50 mile area. I got to be able to travel and cross mountains so I will stick with my tarp and hammock.

grk2rh,,frzna7d,Considering how unfriendly a lot of places in the United States are to bicyclists already, I have trouble seeing where you'd be able to comfortably ride or park that! And pedaling it with all that weight would be an immense pain. Hope you have the thigh strength of a Greek god.
grk2rh,,frziom9,Water reclamation would get heavy bro. I really hope you don't have hills where you live.
gr0qrw,frwss1t,,Were you sleeping in a usual spot? Do you think you've ever seen him before? How are you dealing with nerves?
gr0qrw,,frwt9k3,Yes I was sleeping in the spot that I always do. And like I said, face was fully covered, so idk if I've ever seen them before. Also, I'm a little on edge and looking over my shoulder more often than usual now.
gr0qrw,,frwv1wc,You should have 8 - 10 spots to sleep in and randomize which one you go to on any given night.  You became predictable. Change this immediately. Do not let anyone know where your sleep spots are and avoid letting anyone see you come or go.  I know some younger people use a hammock off the ground up in the tall trees. I never tried that but seems like a good idea if you climb.  People seldom look up.  Another idea is to go to the top of a very steep hill to camp. Lazy people don't go up there.  Don't cook or eat in your sleep areas as dogs and wild animals are attracted to it. Practice light discipline too. Use a public park for cooking and eating.
gr0qrw,,frxmiii,Yes. You should not have a pattern that anyone can follow. And to echo u/visionque , no one ever looks up. And always, always have at least 3 escape routes from where you sleep
gr0qrw,,fry5r32,did the hammock is the only thing that has gotten me good sleep one night during 2016 when the clowns are running around I had one following me for 3 hours I climbed a tree through a rope over and slept in the f****** tree I could hear him looking for me
gr0qrw,frww7df,,I wish I had some advice. I don't. But I just wanted to say that admire your strength and fortitude. Keep on keepin on.
gr0qrw,frxdupd,,Is there maybe a wooded area you can pitch a tent in? I stayed in the woods next to an interstate for six months, was probably the safest place I could have been. It was up a steep hill next to the bridge, my thought was nobody was gonna follow me up that hill. Only once did someone walk through but they left me alone.   I hope you stay safe out there.
gr0qrw,frw8rss,,Damn dude wtf
gr0qrw,frxff2f,,Absolutely crazy bro. Sounds like you need a shelter to me, first and foremost.
gr0qrw,frwstyx,,Were you sleeping in a usual spot? Do you think you've ever seen him before? How are you dealing with nerves?
gr0qrw,frwuuck,,Get a taser if possible. If not a can of hairspray works as low cost mace. My friend has a taser that looks like a cellphone.
gr0qrw,,frx1u4w,I noticed nobody has suggestions for a face mask/goggles combo. So if I had mace of my own it would have worked on him?
gr0qrw,,frxffd9,That's because the other responses either deal with not being there again, so you avoid the confrontation, or you escalate the confrontation with a show of greater force... knife to a gunfight as it were.  Your solution of increasing your defenses to remain where you are isn't as popular an option.  The face mask/goggles don't protect you from a knife.  Money has to be an issue for you, and you don't want to be robbed for your face mask and goggles.  I don't know if there is an Army/Navy surplus store anywhere near you, but you can look there for a cheap, older gas mask.  You can hit the painter's section of a Lowes or Home Depot for masks and goggles... I think that the ability to replace them should be more important than the durability at this point.  You should be able to get clear plastic face shields as well in those stores.  Well... maybe not NOW with the pandemic and all... but full face shields for grinding and chainsaw work etc.
gr0qrw,,frxf17v,dont buy mace. research and get a more powerful oc spray. Sabre red is good. Sleeping in a mask sounds awful, a tent would do you much better probably. Also a powerful flashlight with a strobe function is a great self defense tool
gr0qrw,,fryog4x,Seconding the strobe flashlight . They make some that are dazzling, put off anyone trying to advance towards you. They are blinded and dazzled by the super bright led and strobe combo. Destroys their night vision for minutes.
gr0qrw,,fryehuc,With a small can of hairspray and a lighter you can make big flames. I don't know if that's legal where you are though.
gr0qrw,frx0hxu,,Glad you came out safe. Sounds like a good time to hunt up a few new spots.
gr0qrw,frxbfr1,,If he was yanking on your pack, then how did he have a can of bear mace in one hand and a sword in the other?
gr0qrw,,frxbumm,After I woke up.and jumped out, I pulled the pack over to me and threw it behind me. That is when he armed himself.
gr0qrw,,frxdqcc,Well, glad you are ok.
gr0qrw,,fry7jci,I'd put my money on sword/mask/mace guy on having some sort of belt for these things. Hell, just about every utility item I've ever bought has come with a belt pouch of some sort (knives, multi-tools, sprays, even some phones).
gr0qrw,fryqp12,,You don't wanna sleep in a mask all the time though. Mace burnseverywhere it touches too. They sell wipes on Amazon to neutralize the burn of spray.    https://www.amazon.com/Sudecon-Pepper-Spray-Decontamination-Wipes/dp/B00LNPBKDW   Also might be worth looking into sone kinda perimeter alarms. They sell ones that use a 12 gauge blank.   https://www.amazon.com/Alarm-Signaling-Device-Booby-Trap-trespassers/dp/B07YJ4P1PV/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=12+gauge+trip+alarm&qid=1590573954&sr=8-5
gqdfu5,frtsi3h,,Honestly, take her out for a hot meal and just hang out. Whether she's bringing all this stuff on herself (not outside of the realm of possibility, obviously) or just going through hard times, either way it gets super fucking isolating out there. Go to the rec center and chill in the hot tub or something (if they're open, covid and all). Get a coffee and play some chess. Whatever.  When i was homeless i had a few friends who weren't, and we hung out and just did stuff and it was good. You taking the time out can be way more valuable than you think.
gqdfu5,,frwintz,That's a great idea. She called me yesterday to explain that one of her friends might have found a place for her and I haven't heard anything since. I'll probably call her back this evening to check on things. That would be a perfect opportunity to set up some kind of in-person meeting.

gqqnak,,frvqqti,I'm sedentary and entirely alone. I have no friends.  My inheritance is going to be the only money I ever have, in a few years, if I am still alive. I might have a portable house built for me and get an electric bike-car to haul it in.

glx3ne,fr1911o,,This genuinely feels like a troll question to me. Being homeless fucking sucks. The two options are not ‚ÄúDoctor or Homeless‚Äù.
glx3ne,fr12uf8,,The answer to the question is yes, being homeless is worse. Someone in a terrible job can at least try to switch jobs. It's easier than "deciding" to not be homeless.  This morning, I woke up, stretched, probably scratched, got out of my comfortable bed and went to the bathroom to take a leak. Then I flushed, so I didn't have a room smelling of urine. This morning, a homeless person woke up, stretched, probably scratched, got off the cardboard on the sidewalk they were sleeping on and then had to take a leak in a cold alley (the weather is windy and cold here), looking around to ensure that nobody could see them, then take a leak. Then they don't flush, because that alley doesn't have running water. Now picture doing that every few hours while awake, every day of the year, possibly for the rest of your life.  That is not the homeless person's most serious problem.  Medical school may be a mistake for you. That doesn't mean your only other option is living on the street. You have to have a bachelor's degree to even get into medical school. You can find other work with that degree. Many places just want a degree, and they don't care what the degree is in.  In addition, if you are depressed, you should consult a doctor. Ignoring a medical problem is like refusing to use a crutch if you broke your leg.
glx3ne,fr259qn,,If you don't like stress, you will not enjoy homelessness.   &#x200B;  Never having a moment to sleep where you can relax with assurance that no one will kick you awake and tell you to move. Not knowing where, exactly, your next meal or other needs will come from 90% of the time. Having to contend with everyone else just to meet basic survival needs.   &#x200B;  It's not exactly a fucking walk in the park, friend. Literally. Because even just taking a walk in the park while homeless can sometimes get the cops called to remove you.
glx3ne,fr2ymnv,,Believe it or not, a not uncommon question many homeless people ask themselves at some point is "Homeless or Prison".  Because on the surface, getting shelter, regular meals, access to education, and a regimented life seems more appealing than being homeless.  What I don't understand is why you can't change the direction of your education.  There are other options in the medical field than just Doctor.  Now.... and here's the thing... you can TRY being homeless at any time.  I don't know about where you are and what school you are attending, but chances are you aren't going there now, what with this Covid-19 thing.  That means you are likely self-isolated.  I also know you get breaks from school for holidays and such.  With that potential Doctor's brain of yours, it should have occurred to you that you could go and "pretend" to be homeless for a week or so.  Leave your car at your place, lock everything up, leave anything behind you can't live without when it gets stolen, put on some dirty jeans and a shirt, and go live on the streets for a while.  get a feel for exactly what you think being homeless is like.  Now, granted, it isn't going to be the same AT ALL, since at any time, you'll be able to schlep back to your place and step back into your normal lifestyle.  The presence of that safety net is going to keep you from feeling like you are actually homeless.  It is one thing to go sleep on the streets for a week or two, knowing that it is a vacation.  It is another to be there because you have NOWHERE else to go.  Maybe you can take a sabbatical from school for a few months or a year, and live homeless for the entire time, since the longer you are sleeping on the streets, the more real it is going to feel.  And maybe you should take your car with you, and live in that.  I've seen homeless living in Jaguars before (one in Washington state, and one in California).  I'm sorry.  I still can't get past the fact that you claim to be in Med school, and it hasn't occurred to you to actually try living this way for a while... and it hasn't occurred to you to change the direction you are going in Med school to one that is more favorable.  I guess I'm surprised that you got this far, considering that it isn't something you are passionate about.  Knowing these things, if you made it to becoming a Doctor, I'd be worried about the intelligence levels of Doctors in general.  How many other fucking morons out there became Doctors without wanting to be, while thinking being homeless was a better option?  Did it ever occur to you that you could finish Med school, use the fact that you are a Doctor to marry some rich woman, and then you could sit on your ass all day long?  In comfort?
glx3ne,,fr3tt4g,Hey dude, I gotta say thank you very much for this post. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm romanticizing things outside of medical school.   The reality is I‚Äôm clinically depressed, and my mind is not in the right place. I was interested in medicine at one point‚Äîand somehow it all died.
glx3ne,,fr3wvzg,Are you normally prone to flights of fancy?  What I mean is... do you have a history of leaping before you look?  Committing to the financial burden of medical school, as well as the extreme amount of time necessary to get the career off the ground, and the amount of work involved isn't anything anyone should ever undertake lightly.  I mean... no one should ever decide "I think I'll become a doctor" on a whim.  Interested is one thing.  I can think of lots of things I'm interested in... but committing 8 to 12 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to something is more like following a calling.  That's an investment.  That's building a life around something.  Where you live, who you socialize with, how you dress... all these things and more are affected.  And... you don't get a refund for what you've invested so far, if you give it all up.  Now... I am aware of the old adage, that Doctors make the worst patients... but I have to ask.  You are clinically depressed.  Are you seeing a doctor about this?  Are you talking to a psychologist or a psychiatrist?  Does the university you are attending have a career counselor of any kind you can speak to?  In short... have you taken your troubles and thoughts to a professional, or only here to Reddit?
glx3ne,,fr3z22j,Yes, I tend to take leaps of faith and sometimes I do everything to get what I want and I get really motivated/driven/dedicated to it, but then when I have it, I don‚Äôt want it anymore.   Yes, I‚Äôm seeing a psychiatrist, who recommends medications, which I always refuse :(
glx3ne,,fr83y24,Please listen to the poster above. I take leaps of faith hoping shit will work out. It ended up with me homeless for 18 months. First month not to bad, second month worse and it progressively got worse. Getting out of homelessness is very very very hard. I'm scraping by right now, but barley. Change paths, get some help if you need it. Don't go homeless.
glx3ne,,fr463w4,psychologists can't prescribe meds.  Might be an option to switch to one.
glx3ne,fr0zvkf,,There's a lot of options between medschool and homeless. Peace Corps, woofer on a farm, get a used rv on two acres, etc. Being homeless can be super stressful and depressing - not a great way to get out of a stressful and depressing life situation.  Also, talk to your advisor - you're definitely not the first person to find out medschool wasn't what you thought it would be.
glx3ne,fr6qfkx,,Dear Future Doctor. You are deep in a depression. I have been there and it almost killed me and I lost years. Look into Esketamine, available as a nasal dose. If that doesnt work do the dance with antidepressants but dont throw away a career.  You get through this and you will love yourself more for persevering.
glx3ne,fr443sb,,You tell me. Do you enjoy being hungry? Do you like not washing your ass everyday? Do you like always sitting or sleeping somewhere with one eye open, knowing youre never really welcome anywhere? Do you like living with the chance that law enforcement or others may harass you for being you? Do you enjoy struggling to find a safe place to take a shit? Lastly, do you enjoy being judged for your faulty life choices?  If you enjoy most or all of these ideas, then the streets are where you belong. If not, grow up, find a job you enjoy, or can at least tolerate, pay your bills, and enjoy the life you have.
glx3ne,fr0ruji,,I worked at a place I grew to hate and stayed until it almost killed me. Do something else if you dont like medicine I can tell you it will only get worse as time goes by and will turn into a huge regret later in life.
glx3ne,fr3nooh,,There's not much difference, this 'system' is designed to be oppressive no matter which road you go down, the type of stress a doctor goes through would be a special sort of hell though, being homeless is far more basic, where will I sleep tonight?
glx3ne,fr0hdhz,,Well maybe you just need a mental break. If you truly do not want to be a Dr. be true to yourself and follow a different path that you do like. Find something less stressful in the end you should not force yourself for whatever reason you and patients will suffer. Hope you find clarity and peace in your life.

I set aside at least two days out of the week that I absolutely don‚Äôt drink on and it helps to further reduced my drinking. Sometimes I go a few weeks of not drinking until I get bored with whatever book I‚Äôm reading or project. I get much of my food from church kitchens when I can or the occasional food bank in my area.

Nowadays people are looking at government to provide them with housing, food, care and so on. People back then built, planted or traded what they had. I am glad your inner spirit woke.    Far too many are comfortable in their situation, whether housed or not, and suddenly realize years have gone by and nothing has changed or they‚Äôre worse off. You have a job now, but it‚Äôs not a guarantee for how long. This is when you have the opportunity to build your savings for emergency, rent and cut out your frivolous expenses.

Why hasn't any of this occurred to you since last October?  Ok.  I'll give you a month there.  November.  You should have gotten into the EBT system by then, and given up the beer.  Maybe even the cigarettes, or at least name brand cigarettes... or have gotten into rolling your own to make it even cheaper.  I get it.  You want something to change.

gj7d5c,fqj3gid,,#Pittsburgh received $1 million for the homeless situation here and that was a year ago and it‚Äôs still sitting in a bank account doing nothing but collecting interest for the city.
gj7d5c,fqk7sh7,,im sorry but no. this begins to intrude on constitutional rights. forcing a person to move across state or even across country borders on illegal to wrong when their family is in a certain place
gj7d5c,fqjuksr,,Definitely needs to be tweaked. This talks about adults, but doesn't mention kids, either those whose families are homeless or the seriously young runaway types. (I know there are programs for kids, but what about entire families? I didn't see that addressed.)  The city-for-the-homeless is also concerning. It sounds rather like a tribal reservation or project housing. Neither of those things had a good outcome that I know of.  And couples. Partner1 needs alcohol or drug rehab, partner2 has mental issues. Do you split them up? Or is there a way to accommodate couples and families with mixed ... diagnoses ... if that's the right word.
gj7d5c,fqlh7rv,,First sentence: ‚ÄúOver 550,000 people are homeless in the United States.‚Äù No...Its about 10 million. If this guy really cared about the homeless situation he would easily find the real number like I did. It‚Äôs not even that hard to research this or to understand why HUD keeps that number low. I‚Äôm a high school and college dropout and lazily found this answer at my public library. HUD has historically underestimated it so that the problem can persist by underfunding it. No matter who is in the Whitehouse or which party controls the senate or congress. 3 million are either rough sleeping, in shelters, in mental hospitals and prisons...7 million are sleeping in vehicles or couch surfing, or in hotel at any time of year...near homeless but they are homeless.
gj7d5c,fqkb3oh,,By paragraph 4 I had to skip forward to the end to see if this is satire.  It's not.  All I can say is WOW, who told this guy that his opinion/idea has merit? I wish I could be utterly shocked, but such stupidity has ceased to amaze me.  Read a fucking book, fella.  Your idea is yet another garbage rendition of something which has already been tried and failed, due to its basis being rooted in inhumanity and profound ignorance.  I imagine there's a reason whoever posted this did so from a throwaway, it's likely some very lame propagandist or someone who would stand to profit from this "solution" / from the webpage to which we're linked. That or someone who's never read any history or any of the findings made by scientists and economists regarding this subject.  Someone who's mom told him he's a smart boy perhaps *a tad too much*.  Get in line! You're in good company! This ain't amateur hour mf!
gj7d5c,fqkrr4h,,Honestly all I want is an affordable rv or travel trailer with a place to live in it without being bothered. That would be luxury.
gj7d5c,,fqp7z7p,You sound reasonable....many homeless are demanding free housing in dense West Coast cities, which mostly  means small condos or micro-housing.  (Actually it is almost always *homeless advocates* who are doing the demanding; these activists   are rarely homeless and usually have liberal arts degrees.)  There's a lot of NIMBYism going on about homeless sited in expensive cities like San Francisco.  Average housed person is always happy to hear of homeless willingly  live in mobile home parks outside cities.  Cheaper way to live....hope we can fund this sort of housing.
gj7d5c,fqk6ioa,,I am interested in having a place homeless people could come to if they chose. I oversaw a 50 person tent village. It was completely run by the homeless people that lived there. It gave them purpose and dignity. I'd love to see if something like that could scale.
gj7d5c,,fqkb1ub,I used to volunteer to be in rotation for a house (an actual house) to live, cook, and just be with homeless seasonal workers traveling between towns to the next place.  We used to call these flop houses out in the logging areas eons ago. They were usually connected to, sometimes owned by, companies doing the work. This can be really bad when tied to a job, bit a good option when not.  You live in a semi steady state, plenty of comrades around, and far less problems than a shelter (which is anything but that). I'd rather find houses to shape into these than spend a dime on concentration camps for the homeless.
gj7d5c,fqjhkeb,,That's interesting. Much of it sounds good, but, cynic that I am, I see much potential for corruption and abuse. Lets face it, the government fucks up everything they put their hands to. Nor do I like the idea of giving up my freedom for the 'crime' of being homeless. If it actually worked as intended, it would warrant serious consideration. But what are the chances it would?
gj7d5c,,fqjq9xu,Yeah the idea sounds great as far as saving money but I cant imagine what the city of homeless would look like. Even if it started out good, it has the potential to get outta control really fast.
gj7d5c,fqmrosc,,Interesting to hear everyone's perspective. If you don't agree with the independent city, what would you propose? Increased rehabilitation facilities in each major city? Tiny house camps in each city? I would like to hear what y'all think would work better.
gj7d5c,,fqnnbdw,Legislation affects development.  You'd need a team of law professionals, economic experts, social scientists, healthcare workers, land developers, and ex-homeless advisory boards working together to analyze various pieces of public policy before any solution of value might be put forth.  We, the homeless and ex-homeless, are just one piece of that equation.  Most of us aren't formally educated in law.  But we know that Housing-First is the most cost-effective and rational approach conceived and applied thus far.  Socialized medicine, like other industrialized nations, and other progressive measures would assist in remediating many many problems that lead to homelessness.  The thing is wealth is not necessarily owned by those who create it.  Wealth can concentrate in the possession of isolated pockets of the population, and where that wealth is, naturally dicates also where it is not.   Where poverty takes place, wealth creation is also taking place.    My point is, there is no solving the poverty or homeless problems so long as extreme greed, ignorance, and unearned privilege are allowed to exist unchecked.  Many people profit off of poverty, and *do not want* to eradicate it.  So I think the first course of action, although by no means the only, would have to be to Identify Those People, and figure out a way of incentivizing them toward alternative industries.  Take loan sharks, for example.  Make them get a real fuckin' job, so to speak. And give them the education to do so!  You're way off the mark talking about rehabs.  Rehabs are businesses. And they only treat a symptom of the problem, they do not address roots.  If you create jobs that depend on sickness, poverty, and addiction for their existence, naturally those businesses / workers have no incentive to genuinely solve sickness, poverty, and addiction.  Indeed, social workers are well-renowned for being pisspoor at their jobs, be it because there's not enough oversite, the pay isn't good, the qualification requirements are lax, or systemic/bureaucratic policies in place limit them from having creative liberty or excelling in performance.  Often money is being funneled upward, rather than trickling down.  We police the poor, but we aren't policing the rich.  The rich who literally buy human beings.  Who buy politicians, buy children to rape, buy women and men to rape, buy women men and children to labor for them, and leverage their wealth and power to acquire more and more assets and block more and more people out of competing in the free market, and so on.  If you want to solve homelessness, punish powerful predators, incentivize ethical business practices, and de-militarize the police.  The idea here is to minimize and avert trauma and predation and concentration of power, using what's known by scientists and teaming them with law experts for drafting public policy.  And keep the lobbyists and corporate interests at a very limited level of influence in the conversation!! TAX THEM. TAX THE FUCK OUT OF THEM.  A healthy society with less homelessness, less unplanned pregnancy, less drug addiction and less abuse and strife will follow. This rigged system is bogus and an absolute perversion of what a capitalistic democratic republic ought to look like. Everyone is miserable.  I dream of moltov cocktails and sledgehammers through mansion walls because this is so fucking ridiculous, but I do not want it to come to that.  An earnest conversation will do.  Mental illness needs to be addressed as an issue of its own, likewise drug addiction. The opioid crises was CREATED BY AN INDUSTRY. Homelessness is a condition experienced by a diverse and expansive population, not just the ill and the addicted. It's it's own issue, that need not be married to the others.    For a quick fix, tax the fuck out of multibillionaires STOP ALLOWING THEM TO SEND MONEY OVERSEAS AS A LOOPHOLE TO AVOID INVESTING IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, and use that revenue to develop swaths of land, give the modest houses up for free no strings attached, and hire an abudance of QUALIFIED AND CARING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS to check in on the mentally ill.  In normal conditions I wouldn't suggest this, but having our country being actively bankrupt by corrupt idiots isn't what I'd call normal.  Common, yes, but not normal.  Shits hitting the mf FAN.  The U.S. needs to put up or shut up, cause our populace is getting weaker and dumber by the day, it'll be just a matter of time before a better nation absorbs us and the American experiment will have been an utter failure.  We might also want to stop the wealthy elites overseas from continuing to purchase fucktons of land here in the U.S.  For obvious reasons, this common practice might be a tad problematic!  There's a reason mansions and entire unit complexes, entire blocks, entire neighborhoods sometimes, sit empty across the U.S., oftentimes, the *people who own these properties don't even fucking live in this country*  This pandemic has exposed the nudity of the emperors, imo.  Our nation is a pile of bones being picked clean by green-eyed and pea-brained vultures who only look sharp in a good suit and they're selling us all out.  Homelessness isn't just a problem to be solved, it's a condition that was created and you must reverse-engineer that creation process if you ever wish to understand, much less to undo, the damage that's been done.
gj7d5c,fqp7dzh,,Excerpt:  > If they fail the drug test, they would be placed in a rehabilitation facility (like those already utilized today).   Civil libertarians won't support this.  "Placed" implies mandatory.  Civil libertarians want all rehab and other supportive counseling programs to be *outreach,* which mean voluntary participation.  Voluntary is the basis of reformers' platform for the housing nationwide:  1) Drug testing - voluntary. 2) Placement in shelters - voluntary (if homeless don't like the place, they go). 3) Homeless asked to stop hanging out in parks or on busy streets drinking all day (sometimes shooting up) and panhandling - voluntary.  Non-voluntary means confinement in some sort of facility. Police enforced.   Sorry folks...there's no halfway here.   We've had outreach workers in my city trying to deal with the myriad of homeless issues for 15 years -- policy is always that *homeless can reject interventions.*  Civil libertarians call it Freedom.

ghx0m1,fqbanti,,What are the primary factors that have led you to being homeless?   If there was one thing you could have us all take away from this conversation, what would that thing be?
ghx0m1,,fqbhovk,Unaddressed and untreated depression that led me to poor transitional coping decisions.  I got a divorce and it wrecked me mentally, I didnt have a large support system and we had moved to a different city so no family. I eventually tried to OD and lost my job because of the hospitalization. Depression was left untreated. It's taken awhile for me to get to a place where anythjng even seems somewhat overcome able. And theres a severe lack or resources in my community for quick assistance.
ghx0m1,,fqbq0lj,Are you receiving treatment for depression now? Were you resistant to treatment earlier?
ghx0m1,,fqbx4hq,I am receiving treatment through trauma counseling. There are several programs available that offer low cost mental health treatment programs.
ghx0m1,,fqbhuiz,One take away would be to not underestimate the connection between mental health and homelessness. It doesn't take much or long to lose your sense of humanity or connection society once you're on the streets. Dont be afraid to ask for help and take it when it's available because its not guaranteed.
ghx0m1,fqcv6ry,,Well ima be honest with you...a year or two of homelessness your not gonna be looking so pretty which you are.

ghx0m1,,fqbzjzo,Yeah, I laughed at myself when you pointed it out, j got distracted a bit typing it, and I reminded myself to change the spelling, but here we are üòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ghx0m1,,fqbtqi4,Well put; I say keep in touch here, something I need to work on myself but its usually loss of a reliable community which lands people in this scenario. Nifty ideas like taking advantage of Webull wouldve been great since with just 2 referrals we had the opportunity to gain a free 100$ - 1,400$+ although their promo just ended today things like this all ways appear, we're here for you.
ghx0m1,,fqbzdct,Thank you! I'll make sure to keep that in mind. There is definently a lack of community support in a lot of ways.
ghx0m1,fqqv9p0,,Are you single?
ghx0m1,fqhfv60,,But to answer the initial question, I worded the post the way that I did because the majority of the population, again I say this because I've collected enough evidence to support my claim, tend to view the general homeless population in a very negative light. I'm simply reminding them that in the beginning, all of us look the way I do it's the lack of compassion, the lack of resources, jumping through hoops to do things that should be easily accessible t all individuals. It's the constant struggle to just survive that causes so much mental damage you start to believe you dont deserve anything more.
ghx0m1,,fqib46q,I call bullshit. First, I highly doubt you are out there collecting any evidence on anything. At best, you may have made a broad assumption that the homeless are viewed in a negative light (congrats Sherlock!).  Now you are backtracking and TRYING to say that's the point of your post, but in reality you posted a picture of yourself assuming you were hot enough to get lots of positive comments. That backfired, you got zero likes, and now you are trying to save face for whatever reason that may be.
ghx0m1,,fqj2ui1,??? I think if you've only seen street homelessness someone might have that image of homelessness, but being homeless is a multi-faceted problem that doesn't always present itself in a uniform way. If anything, people on the homeless subreddit would not be carrying that stereotype of homeless people. If you posted this on casualama or askreddit the response might have been different.  I think people got rubbed off the wrong way because you considered yourself the exception to the homeless standard.   > 99% percent of the time when you think of a homeless percent, theres a pretty standard image that crosses ones mind, I'm simply trying to bring awareness to the beginning stages of homelessness and what it looks like   I also thought you were at the light at the end of the tunnel? Or maybe the image was from when you were first entering homelessness. I'm not sure, and it's not that important.  My intentions aren't to poke at your post, but I wouldn't dismiss the voices that found the chipper "I'm an attractive homeless" to be well received. If the intentions were to cancel homeless stereotypes, I might have believed it if your post said "Your average homeless person" with a spiel about expectations and appearances which is a major factor with homelessness. You're virtue signalling right now when earlier your posed yourself as an exception.
gh5d2n,fq7q18c,,Is there a reason you assume that homeless people need to be tested for drugs and "competency" just because they happen to be homeless?   Would there be protections put in place to prevent predatory home owners from abusing their new tenants?
gh5d2n,,fq7rx3p,If we were going to convince homeowners to house a homeless person, they would need some assurance that they are letting in a stable person into their homes. What protections would you suggest? Maybe the homeless person can choose to be reassigned at anytime?
gh5d2n,,fq7vrzy,I don't want to live in someone else's home. I don't want to give a stranger a room in my home. I want us to take profit out of housing so everyone can live in their own homes. I don't understand the desire to keep living under a system that creates homelessness in the first place.
gh5d2n,,fq7wk3p,As an ex-homeless person would you accept a home built on cheaper land (not in a major city)?
gh5d2n,,fq7xshm,Depends. I wouldn't be willing to move far from my support network. I only became homeless due to disability and our screwed up social safety net. I would rather have the SS I paid into.
gh5d2n,,fq7yyke,How did you end up getting home? Do you think its a path that other homeless people could take?
gh5d2n,,fq8058a,My state switched my assistance program so instead of the $197 a month cash I was getting they pay $325 a month rent for me. I live in an absolute dump. We can't drink the water and it's full of mold. But it has a toilet and roof. It could be worse.  I have no idea how long the state will pay for this, though. I may be homeless again before the end of the year. It's definitely not a permanent solution, just a step up from the shed I was in before.
gh5d2n,,fq80oum,Where are you able to rent for $325 a month? Is this just for an SRO?
gh5d2n,,fq82dxb,Slumlords are everywhere. It's a studio sized house that I share with my disabled, adult son. Total rent is $650. Landlords are hoarders that live on the property. If my county actually had renter protections this place probably wouldn't be legal to rent.
gh5d2n,,fq7vzvo,If I was still homeless I would want the homeowners to have to pass whatever screening I was expected to pass. Any system that only requires homeless people to prove they're sober/sane is discriminatory and stigmatizing.
gh5d2n,fq7rocg,,I can see a few problems with this idea.  1. Small cities with less demand for renters also have fewer jobs. 2. You need more than three months. A working homeless person may need more than three months to save up first and last month's rent, even if they're living "rent free" for that short period of time. This works much better in a large city with lots of jobs.
gh5d2n,,fq7t8f9,What do you think is the best path out of homelessness? My thought for the idea was that with a stable home for a few months, a homeless person could try to connect with family or apply for jobs in cities they have a chance of living in a stable life in.
gh5d2n,,fq7wzm5,I am on this subreddit because a family member of mine is homeless. This solution would not work for her. She lost her professional designation, among other things.  Years ago, I read a success story. Unfortunately I don't have the reference, and since it's been years I probably have details wrong. The homeless man was employed as a photographer and model, part-time, and suffered from depression. After a three month bout he "emerged" from depression to find himself homeless, which I presume was because he wasn't working and couldn't pay rent.  Fortunately he had resources. He still had his bank account, his camera, some clothes, his ID, etc. Also, he was single with no children and no pets.  He slept on the roof of an apartment building, got a gym membership (he probably had one before, being a model) so he could shower, could still get paid via bank account, etc. This was before iPhones so I guess he went to the library for his electronic communication needs, and probably had a flip phone with voicemail (and a bank account to pay his phone bill). It took him nine months to get out of homelessness.  This person was, by the standards of homeless people, fortunate. Yes he had a mental illness, but he wasn't talking to the stars or screaming at random people, and wasn't an alcoholic or drug addict. (Depression that could essentially knock him out for three months is severe, yet did not impede his social relations when he was not presently depressed. A lack of social capital is very common among the homeless.) He was otherwise healthy. He did not have dependents to support and had no pets, so his expenses were low. He was able to solve problems and had good social skills. *He didn't actually lose his job.* Obviously he wasn't paying rent (usually the biggest expense) and it took him more than half a year to save up enough to pay first and last months' rent. I wish I could find the story, because I want to know if he kept up with his medication afterward (maybe he wasn't taking it before?) because it would be tragic if he simply became homeless again.  He lived in a big city (I have a hard time believing he could find sufficient work to support himself in a small city). Even if this project helped people out of homelessness, they're going to want to move to places with more stable career supports, where rent is more expensive. They will be unlikely to move from large cities that have resources to support the poor and homeless unless everything is being taken care of (not just a home, but a job).  Perhaps some sort of room and board project might work (as in give them a job, plus cheap rent, possibly free for a few months). If they cannot save up enough money, they could remain. The proposed project would simply result in unemployed people getting kicked out in three months, because they won't be able to pay rent at that point unless they've gotten lucky.
gh5d2n,,fq7yohp,Do you think a few months off the streets would be good for people's mental health and give them some time to find opportunities or would a permanent home/income (maybe UBI) be the only solution?
gh5d2n,,fq7z2yr,While the person in that example had a mental illness, it wasn't exacerbated by the homelessness. It *caused* the homelessness, but it was cyclical in nature. It "recovered" on its own, and then he got out of it. Giving him a home for a few months wouldn't have helped as it would have had little impact on his mental health. For the person I know, I doubt a few months would help her recover either. She couch surfed for about a year (not stable, but not on the streets) and she did *not* improve.  There is no one solution because there is no one cause. A "Housing First" solution that deals with problems and not just housing might work, but UBI will not work. (In fact, it wouldn't be universal if it's just targeted at the homeless or the poor anyway.)  A "Housing First" solution has to be able to keep homeless people in their general community, or at least communities of choice.
gh5d2n,,fq7zycw,How do you define "their general community", isn't it common for homeless to move to a big city (think SF) because of their homeless services. Would that count as "their general community" or are you referring to where the homeless person is originally from?
gh5d2n,,fq81suq,Despite the popular rhetoric, most homeless people in any geographic area are from there.
gh5d2n,,fq828qe,When you were homeless and talked to others, this was the common case? They lived in a city, got laid off/lost their home, and now live on the street?
gh5d2n,,fq82zg1,Yes.
gh5d2n,,fq83i4z,Where did you live?
gh5d2n,,fq81mz8,I've bounced back and forth between being housed and being homeless for the last decade. It's actually WORSE for mental health to get temporary housing.   By the way, this is already how most shelters and transitional housing programs are set up. Anything under a year is going to be putting people right back where they came from.
gh5d2n,,fqc1a77,A lot of shelters are only on a night by night basis too which is pretty bad
gh5d2n,fq6itxa,,Sure! Of course I prolly wouldn't fit this program as I'm not a visibly homeless or housing endangered person now..
gh5d2n,fq6i90f,,I think this is thinking in the right direction-  But the time window is too dependent on independent variables to easily pin down a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù system.  I think drug testing and mental health evaluation would be a must.  I‚Äôm not sure how one would go about advertising to potential homeowners, but maybe find folks who own a home (or rent to a consenting landlord) and are on some sort of government assistance themselves- this then becomes doubly beneficial as the additional income may alleviate some, or all of their need for government help.
gh5d2n,,fq6qqqp,I feel like there are a lot of homeowners that live in areas where demand for rent is not high. They may be struggling to pay their mortgages and this could help them while housing people in need.
ggtmsi,fq5047t,,Somehow I read this as "hooked on rent" which would be another intriguing statement

ggtmsi,,fql5yk4,Found the VA spokesperson.
ggtmsi,,fql616v,No but I am a Moderator for /r/Veterans and someone brought this post to our attention
ggtmsi,,fql6bjr,How flattering. I didn't post it there.
ggtmsi,,fql6fxa,But someone else did
ggtmsi,,fql6v12,You have a problem knowing many veterans are homeless and addicted to hard drugs  are being neglected by the VA in the states? My comment addressed the VA in the states. I didn't know it was a photo from Canada.
ggtmsi,,fql72ef,Yes, my problem is we don't want any veterans to be homeless or addicted to hard drugs.
ggtmsi,,fql7r3o,Me neither. I met so many during my 'outdoors phases'. Many were otherwise the nicest people, struggling with PTSD, physical disability and addiction.   The disability made it difficult to function in normal society, the neglect by the VA forced them to turn alternatively to self medicate with alcohol or drugs (no difference except legal one) creating an endemic problem with family, employment and homelessness.  The look of the person in the photo reminded me of my experience. The scorpion tattoo on the arm...
ggtmsi,fq5h8jy,,This is just SAD AND DISTURBING!
ggtmsi,fq69r0t,,Step one is to make the decision to quit fentanyl and alcohol. Once you've decided that you're done, and there's no going back, and no excuses for why it's okay just this one time, find help staying sober. There are many groups that will give you free housing, food, and care while you detox and clean up. From there, you make sure you stay living in an SLE, and you get a job. You wake up, make a bag lunch, leave the SLE and go straight to work. Do not stop anywhere, do not talk to anyone on the way. Work at that said job for as many hours as you possibly can. Pick up doubles if you can. Keep yourself busy all the time. On lunch, go catch a meeting if you can. After work, go straight to a meeting every day. As soon as the meeting is over, go home, cook dinner, and go to bed. Wake up the next day and do it again. Routine is very important. Work six days a week. On Sunday go to church. All day if you can. Get to know the pastor/priest/ Rabbi/ Imam. Volunteer for whatever service you can. Work at a food bank. Council people in their journey. All of this will take time to establish, but the point of all of it is to drastically and completely change all of your habits and ways of being. Stay busy, and stay in service. It's really tough the first six months, but it gets easier. Anyone who wants to get clean. I mean really WANTS it. You've gotta want it like you want air after holding your breath to the point of passing out. There can be no other options, and no other choices. The mentality has to be it's this or death, and I'm not dying today.       Hope this helps.       Love- a former homeless person and recovering addict
ggtmsi,,fq6iovs,I don't think this works too well, just *reading* that is overwhelming.
ggtmsi,,fq6ld04,It's the only thing that works. I tried many things for many years. I tried doing less, I tried switching drugs, I tried lots of different things, and my results were always the same. I was more fucked up and in a worse situation than I'd been in just a couple weeks/ months before. I had more than five years of being on the streets before I finally made a change.
ggtmsi,,fq6rlj0,I've never been attracted to fent but tried it a couple times.  I'm a recovered Alcoholic and I agree with your previous comment.  What "saved" me was knowledge through an old Irish man from South Boston who took no shit.  His love and experience from his recovery from alcohol and Alcoholic Anonymous.  He was old school and did not believe in the meeting makers make it philosophy.  Meetings were there to share our stories with the newcomer then take them through the 12 Step process.  So they too could recover. like we had.  Previous to this man I had many sponsors, many rehabs, many chances and failed at solving my problem.   It was pointed out to me later on by the old Irish man that the "gift" of desperation had finally took hold of me and I had consciously begun to look at it as a life or death situation.  Similar to a man on the battle field.  And in fact the active alcoholic is such a man when it concerns booze.  He battles himself constantly.  So ONLY then could I HONESTLY say that I was willing to surrender.  That was pointed out to me early on by this man who sponsored me.  Because most alkies hate surrendering let alone their best friends drinks and drugs ALL that was required was a willingness! Quoted from one of the founder Bill W., from BB pg. 568, "Willingness, honesty, and open mindedness are the essentials of recovery."  This literally changed me towards the man I am today where the people I meet could never fathom I'm a recovered alcoholic who use to shoot dope.
ggtmsi,,fq73j5q,Good job brother. One day at a time. Never give up
ggtmsi,,fq75zhi,> It's the only thing that works  *for you.
ggtmsi,,fq78d37,So... What worked for you? In my experience, it takes a lot more than just a hope and a prayer. I've been round many addicts, and unfortunately, I've known several who died, including my own mother. Wanting to change and half adding a program hasn't been enough for anyone I've ever met.... It takes serious commitment, and a desire to push everything else out of one's life that isn't healthy. It's about a complete and total transformation, and a complete unrelenting unwillingness to turn even an inch in the wrong direction.  It's a life and death problem. Victim mentality and behavior enabling only prolongs the problem. The problem doesn't go away until we take responsibility. Responsibility for our situation, for our lives, and for our recovery. My addiction is my fault, and my life is my responsibility
ggtmsi,,fq7wd4e,It's what worked for YOU. That isn't proof that it's the "only thing that works".
ggtmsi,,fq80ap4,It's also the generally accepted path among both people who've made it through, and clinicians who supervise. I'm not portending that nobody has ever gotten clean without changing their habits, lifestyle, associations, and way of life... But I'm saying that in recovery you hear of them and never meet them. They're like unicorns. The reason why so much information exists on the subject is based on seeing hundreds of thousands of cases.  I'm also not saying that alternative therapies such as Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, or LSD aren't beneficial. I personally received my initial push to change my situation from a high dose of LSD... But my point is that it takes a support system. It takes a desire to change, and it takes work.  You didn't become an addict over night, and you didn't get into this situation without consistent movement in that direction, and to expect it to change instantly, or without extreme effort is just fanciful. It's hard fucking work. There are hiccups and speedbumps and potholes along the way. It's about the effort and the desire to never give up. Another guy said to fight it like a war. That's a good analogy.  For those who just wake up and everything is peachy keen, rainbows and sunshine I applaud them, but for every recovered addict I've ever met, it's been a journey, with a lot of pain, and a lot of personal growth, and realizations, and concessions, and self acceptance through utter loathing. There's a lot that goes into it.  If you haven't been through it, I recommend sitting in on some meetings. Volunteer at a shelter or an SLE. Talk to some of these folks instead of just spouting off that it's not that way for everyone when you have absolutely no knowledge of addiction or the streets.
ggtmsi,,fq8391i,I was homeless, and I'm very familiar with addiction, having several family members who are addicts.  Is there some reason you feel threatened by the idea that what worked for you isn't necessarily a universal solution?
ggtmsi,,fq846l3,I've acknowledged at least three or four times that what worked for me isn't the only way. I've also sited some other things that have been known to help... So obviously no, I'm not threatened.  I am saying that statistically speaking, there's only one way out, and it's an extreme desire coupled with a strong support system. How you get those things can vary widely.  I've asked a few times for examples of other ways people have gotten sober that you know. Like personal experience. What lead them there? What kept them clean? My buddy did it for his kids. He woke up one day and realized he was killing himself. He didn't care for him, but he cared for his kids. There was still a reason bigger than self, and an extreme desire to change his behavior.  Please. If you have other anecdotes or info, I'd love to hear. I'm not closed minded, I've just never seen anyone change without a huge catalyst
ggtmsi,,fq84bmp,I think we probably agree and just misunderstood what the other was saying then. I thought you were claiming 12 step groups and God were the only answer.
ggtmsi,,fq85cmi,Not at all. I believe that God, and the universe, and you, and I are all the same. I believe in unicity.  My push for meetings, and for church is more for community and support. Having others around who have been through it, or who support you, or in my opinion most importantly, those we can offer support to. Living for a purpose greater than myself is one of the driving factors in maintaining sobriety. I go to church and volunteer, but I don't buy into the gray bearded dude in the sky, it's just a good way to keep busy in a community setting where I'm of value and service to others instead of allowing myself to become self destructive

ggie7r,fq322b5,,You're leading by example. üëç
ggie7r,fq1r5ur,,Hey, I also like doing this, but I sometimes wonder whether I'm actually giving stuff that folks will find useful.  For example a few years ago my husband bought some MREs online and we handed them out to folks on the streets, but then later I watched a video of someone actually opening and preparing an MRE, and was shocked at how wasteful the packaging was and how complicated it was to actually cook the meal.  Since then I've stuck to carrying some sleeping bags, hats, socks, and local resource handbooks around in my car, but now the weather is warming up and I'm not so sure those are going to be as useful right now.  TL;DR: homeless folks, what items do you need the most right now that I could keep stocked in my car?
ggie7r,,fq2svl7,Tbh, the ones that‚Äôre able to use Reddit specifically? Phone chargers lol. And even though it‚Äôs not a necessity, I‚Äôm only half joking. You can buy a box of pasta for like a dollar, but out on the street in regular stores, iphone chargers can cost you up to $15, and that‚Äôs not even including the base. A person with an address however can get maybe 4 good quality ones delivered from amazon for $10, 7 of them if you‚Äôre willing to go with lower quality, and 10 if you buy them from China instead through like AliExpress or something.
ggie7r,,fq2tq7l,Oh wow this is a wonderful idea!  I absolutely think it is a necessity.  I could buy the little adapters and the cables separately in bulk too so they could be used to connect to a computer or whatever.  Thank you!
ggie7r,,fq2wos7,No, thank you! It can‚Äôt be understated what you‚Äôre doing for people in need.  Unfortunately, In 2020, you can‚Äôt really do anything much outside of survival without a phone, and so after a lot of homeless‚Äô physical needs are met, they‚Äôre kind of stuck in limbo. I think it never really crosses a lot of people‚Äôs minds because phones are seen as luxury so folks assume if a homeless person has one, they‚Äôre not really homeless. And obviously that can‚Äôt be true looking at this thread. Some of them are able to keep their phone from before, and some of them are lucky enough to find one or buy one on the cheap. This can allow them to apply for jobs, keep in touch with loved ones, look up helpful information, or just entertain themselves to keep from going nuts. But that doesn‚Äôt do any good if they break their charger, as many of us are apt to do, and have to spend what may be a week‚Äôs worth of food on a new one ya know?
ggie7r,,fq4bwck,Give them bags. Doesn't have to be really expensive.  I've seen the mission give out bags to homeless people (inclusing myself) and most homeless I see have one.  I have three bags and would still accept another. That's how useful they are out here.  So go out to wherever homeless people go and hand them out. The library, park, streets, mission or salvation army, tent cities, day labor places, etc. Wherever they are.
ggie7r,,fq4nxwq,Backpacks are even better
ggie7r,,fq4tm3l,Nice, thanks!
ggie7r,,fq4np4m,Second phone charges (esp portable ones) I always had a hard time getting batteries, which I needed for the Christmas lights I set up at my camp, my flashlight, bike light, speaker, and other things. Also bike tire patches/tape Tbh basically every resource area hands out those little handbooks and unless you're new to the street you already know about the good places by word of mouth
ggie7r,,fq4tlhe,Thank you!
ggie7r,,fq8og91,Where I was homeless no one produced or dispersed  resource handbooks. So the demand for those likely vary place to place.  A newcomer to a city or town could def benefit from receiving one imo. <3
ggie7r,,fq8o5pq,Small and seems stupid and wont make or break a person but chapstick. I mention it cause its cheap, small, lightweight, and can ease discomfort incurred from dry cold weather.  With respect to chargers, I've come across a good number of discarded portable charging units (power banks) in good working order.  The fact I came upon more than one working portable as a groundscore made me think they might be cheap now, (once prices drop usually weller-off people take less attentive care of their things, as it becomes replacable) so I looked it up and yeah they can be bought for $3-$10 a piece, and purchased at lower prices wholesale. A powerbank holds energy allowing a person to charge their phone away from a power outlet.  Of course the ones which cost $15+ are way more sturdy prob and likely hold more charge, so it'd be a quality v.s. quantity thing, which can be disheartening a dilemma.  I just mentioned it cause even though I'm not homeless now, I rely on my powerbank a bunch.  Out there there are also solar power-banks, and, totally cool,  *a crank radio.* I adored my crank radio when I lived in the woods. It was my one connection to the outside world. My solar phone-charger was a boon. Also there are shake flashlights, powered by SHAKING IT! (I never had one just admired from afar)  Clean sox are by far one of the most cherished items out there, I think.    Multivitamins, little antibiotic ointment packets, carabiners, small sew kits.

gfgo37,,fpxqciq,Shiskabobs. Whither steak, garlic, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers.
gex77y,fpqv0ji,,How'd you boil the noodles?
gex77y,,fpr3426,Came to ask the same question!
gex77y,,fpre9w0,If you can‚Äôt boil them you can soak them in cold water for awhile and they will get soft. A lot of gas stations have a hot water dispenser on the coffee machine or a microwave
gex77y,,fprg8lz,Thank you!
gex77y,,fprivfm,Yeah.. I don't really. I gotta get something for that.
gex77y,,fpswi9s,Take a bottle of water, remove the label, so it gets full sun and lay it on a black plastic bag for a couple hours. Should be hot enough to soften the noodles on warm days.  I used to put them on the windshield of my car and when I came back an hour or two later the water would scald you it was so hot.

I would add holes to the top edge as well as the bottom so you can use the top to set the pot on.  Heat smooth round stones the size of an egg in a fire. Transfer the stones to water using chop sticks. This is called rock boiling. You can get water to boil in all kinds of containers using this method. Try a paper bag sometime.  Solar [oven](https://www.thecrafttrain.com/diy-solar-oven/) from cardboard and foil.  Dollar Tree sells a stainless steel dog bowl without rubber feet that make a fair cook pot. Use a piece of aluminum foil for a lid. I punched a hole on opposite sides of the rim and added a coat hanger wire bail.

gex77y,fptk3k0,,I made a few of those to start tomatoes in for my homeless garden out in the woods.
gex77y,,fptpjq0,Oh wow. How long does it take to grow tomatoes?
gex77y,,fptpwfd,They should start producing by late July. I also have beans, corn, and squash starting. But I can't get the squash to germinate and bugs keep eating the green beans except for one lone survivor. Only the corn and tomatoes seem to be doing good.
gex77y,,fpts4av,I might do something like this. Maybe plant a bunch of tomatoes and corn. Wonder how a banana tree would do.
gex77y,,fptspqm,Depends on where you're at if it's tropical. It might be awhile before you get a banana harvest though. I plan on planting stuff in a bunch of different vacant land so that I'm not putting all my eggs into one basket. I need to plant crops that can do well unattended for long stretches. That's why I'm sticking to native American crops that haven't been domesticated for thousands of years and can still grow wild but with a smaller yield. I've had this idea for years now but am now implementing it do to the lockdown and possible food shortages.
gex77y,,fptvvfh,Ah it's wonderful that you're planning ahead. One question I've had for a while is how do you get enough crops out of them that it's worth it?
gex77y,,fpv7rm2,Lots of seeds, and lots of cut out empty soda bottles, powerade bottles, and yogurt containers.
gex77y,,fq5t0cr,Lettuce scallions celery potatoes carrots all grow without any real care and are hardy enough to survive with basically any weather I grow them at home and I never have to do anything. The spuds is the best though I get enough to last most of the summer sometimes many months more

I wanted to run up on an agent or something--can you imagine him building one on GMA or something? It'd be amazing.   I guess I should ask folks to cross post or something. Thank you again, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on bringing him forward.   https://theunhoused.com/the-amazing-art-of-peter-lourito/
gdetbe,,fpj5bka,If you set up a page or something, I can definitely help you promote it. I would suggest making other social media ‚Äúpages‚Äù for him as some ppl only use Reddit, or only use Twitter, or only use FB, etc. I have a fairly large network on FB with pages specifically dedicated to helping the homeless where I can share. I can also share on Twitter with philanthropist groups.
gdetbe,,fpj8614,That sounds really great.   I've been writing about the homeless from here in the shelter, because no one knows who we are, and his is the first personal story I'm bringing forward.   It sounds like you're legit, but we'll want to move deliberately. We don't trust very easily, and no homeless person is prepared for any good thing to happen to them.

gcewdw,fpb026l,,I have the same one. Its really cheap and much bigger than it looks. Ive found it works well in rain and wind. Congrats and Good luck :)
gcewdw,,fpb383j,Thank you for letting me know üòÅ  I just set it up today and haven't tested it.
gcewdw,,fpb3l3z,Im not sure if we have the *exact* same model but mine has a mini 'roof' or overhang over the door way. Yours may too but it looks like it may be on wrong in your picture. Again i could be wrong but if this is your model: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-3-Person-Camping-Dome-Tent/422817405 than just spin it around and you can leave the window open for ventilation during the rain.  Edit: AND if that is your model as well, there should be a flap under the tent at the foot of your front door for leaving shoes and dirty things so the tent stays clean :)
gcewdw,,fpb7f9n,I don't have an overhang but that would be cool.  I put my shoes in a plastic zip-lock bag on the flap. This is going pretty well.
gcewdw,,fpba1br,Shouldn't you let your shoes aerate instead of marinate? and good luck. Looks like a nice spot too.
gcewdw,,fpba8dv,If it aerates then I marinate..
gcewdw,,fpbjxi9,No swamp feet. Bad news.
gcewdw,,fpc8hty,If you snag a bag of silica from a beef jerky bag itll help keep moisture out. Essentially Damprid. It might make your shoes smell like jerky tho lol
gcewdw,,fpbqx8j,> than just spin it around and you can leave the window open for ventilation during the rain.  As well, the rain fly over the front door is so you can take off wet or muddy shoes before you go inside.
gcewdw,fpb539t,,Put some foot work into scrounging up a wooden pallet or two and a large flat piece of press board roughly equal to the footprint of your tent so you can lift yourself and your tent up off the swampy ground. It'll help with keeping you dry and reduce thermal convection through contact with the ground and further reduce condensation. Another useful thing to do is camouflage your tent into the surroundings using live flora. A camouflage tarp strung overhead is also useful as camouflage, reduce UV wear on the tent, and extra protection from the rain.
gcewdw,,fpb872i,Definitely! I have a bunch of flora from when I cleared this out. There's a lot more in that 7x7 space than you'd think.  It even got to the point where I had to quite literally- push the greenery out of the way.
gcewdw,fpb27r3,,The group of red flowers in the lower left is [Trumpet](https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=cara2) vine, Campsis Radicans. The sap of the vine can cause contact dermatitis in sensitive people.
gcewdw,,fpb8n4n,Thankfully I haven't messed with them üòÅ
gcewdw,,fpc8dq6,Also an invasive species, feel free to uproot it
gcewdw,,fpby5hb,I had no idea it was dangerous! I've eaten the nectar since I was young
gcewdw,,fpd0a2v,Hummingbirds are very attracted to it.  There are many plants that have toxic parts and edible parts. The white Irish potato we commonly eat as French fries or mashed has toxic leaves. The orange colored sweet potato has leaves that are used as soup in the Philippines. I love to find other cultures that use things in different ways.  Recently I learned that the sunflower plant leaves stem and roots can be eaten. I eat the seeds and oil but was missing out on everything else.
gcewdw,fpb26c7,,That is good social distancing right there ;)
gcewdw,fpb2l8l,,Awesome!

gcewdw,,fpbdouf,Oh haha I thought I saw something red
gcewdw,,fpbdt2k,Ah yeah. Those are flower type things. Someone else commented about how they can cause dermatitis.
gcewdw,fpb5fy3,,Just got done sitting my tent up in my yard to make sure it's still livable, as I'm afraid I'm fixing to be in the same predicament you are in. I'm in the mountains of TN where there's plenty of woods to lay low & discreet but seriously thinking about coming to FL. I have vacationed in Florida the last 4 years & love it there but I hardly ever seen any woods there unless it was way off from civilization & I also hear ol Johnny law is rough on homelessness there. How is your experience so far?
gcewdw,,fpb7xqp,You're correct on that. Most forests are far away from people here in Florida.  There are only a couple of places homeless people put up tents around here.  Good thing this is only temporary. I plan on being out within a month as I'll be working pretty much everyday.
gcewdw,,fpc8qgj,Put your food stuff in a "bear bag", hoist it up in a tree and tie it off, if your spot gets raised while you're gone you'll have your supplies hidden up in the trees. Good way to make sure you have food/bedding/tent out of sight
gcewdw,,fpb66yv,Also get u some kind of bug spray cause the mosquitoes there are treacherous!!

gcewdw,,fpckj82,I don't think there are many alligators walking around here thankfully.
gcewdw,fpchc44,,Get  a camouflage tarp to put over it.
gcewdw,fpb73om,,Florida seems perfect for homeless camping. Warm climate year round, dense forests and swamps, and it's southern lots of hillbilly small towns full of the only slightly less destitute. Of course the government is awful on the homeless population so you win some you lose some
gbxvwf,fp8a6gq,,I don't want to hamp your vibe too hard, but you should definitely be aware that Slab City is highly romanticized in most stories. It isn't as perfect as a lot of folks would have you believe. It's got a lot of really artistic and decent folk, yeah, and there are good things about it but I would never lower my guard there.
gbxvwf,,fp8cue8,I know. I'm less concerned about it though as long as I have a permanent structure there. And a concrete shell - assuming that I can get it built- is surely the ideal way to protect myself there.  I don't expect to be a hippie free spirit taking acid and strumming a guitar under the stars. I am proposing, basically, to live like  Obi-Wan Kenobi there, cooped up in my slab and bathing in same muddy pool the neighbors do.  I just want to find a job, in Niland or elsewhere, which contributes to Social Security.
gbxvwf,,fp8gbnk,I would rethink this whole thing if I were you. I've spent 3 weeks in slab city in my travels so here's my 2c. It's very unlikely you would be able to build a permanent structure there like the one you purpose. Contrary to popular belief imperial county patrols the slabs and your project would get squashed by regs alone not to mention some of the slabbers would get upset about a newbie building something like that with a construction crew ect. If the wrong person/people get upset they will burn you out literally. You would be way better off getting an rv/van and living there for awhile to see if it works for you. You can sell it later and build something after you figure it out there. Good luck getting a job in Niland lmao, there is literally nothing there except a mom and pop grocery store. Imperial county is the poorest county in California, you would have to find a job in El Centro or Brawly and you would have to have a vehicle to get there. Buses go there but you would be a shutdown away from losing your job plus it would be a 2-3 hour commute by bus. You would also need to learn Spanish to improve your chances of finding a job in those places. If it were easy to live there then there would be a megacity out in the desert. But it ain't easy living there. The full time residents go crazy af from the sun and heat after their first year. But with enough grit determination and resources anything's possible but it definitely won't be easy.
gbxvwf,,fp8gcif,?
gbxvwf,,fp8i6t5,Sorry, I'm typing this on a phone so in order to see my text I have to type something and edit it so that I can read what I'm typing.
gbxvwf,,fp8jtly,Is there any place in the country you've experienced where you think this could be done?  Bear in mind I'm poor and would be doing it on an inheritance. I want to live somewhere I can plant this thing down while still having decent access to civilization, even if it means walking on foot to a job. I want this to be my entire life.
gbxvwf,,fp8o5zb,Unless you can find someone who owns land and you could work something out with them. That's the only way I see this working. There's a commune in Tennessee called Shutup and Growit they're pretty cool mostly hippie farmers. But relying on other people has it's own inherent problems. The best way to do this is to buy land and build it unfortunately even though you will have to pay taxes. If I were in your position I would buy a good running school bus and convert it into an rv. The only way to get out of paying property taxes and really living off the grid is to be mobile and nomadic. Otherwise the man is going to rope you in some way or another. There isn't anything within walking distance to work at around the slabs or suagi.
gbxvwf,,fp8pgqu,I just remembered that I heard tale while in Florida of some dirty kid pirates that live on sailboats anchored around off the coast. But the biggest problem with that is commuting to work. I guess if you were to fall in with them they could watch your boat while you go back and forth to work in a dingy. You would probably have to give them a bottle of rum though. You would be amazed what all is possible if you have enough grit, determination, and are willing to put in hard work.
gbxvwf,,fp8k0cj,Fair points. The only argument I have is that, while you do have to bring in a construction crew for it, they are typically constructed in less than a day.
gbxvwf,,fp8nol3,Goodluck.
gbxvwf,fpbwyix,,This sounds like a really bad idea.  What is it that you find so repulsive about living a normal life?

gbb7xo,,fp4wjb6,If you like it, let me know so I can add you as a friend. We can team up and play together!
gbb7xo,,fp6ml1v,I started playing Clash Royale when I was homeless, 3 years later and I still play it and run my own Clan. Its the only mobile game I play. I managed to get off the streets into a room recently as well. Something we all take for granted until we lose it. Having your own room is so amazingly awesome after being homeless.

gb64el,fp3y1ee,,This is a dangerous post to make. I‚Äôve never even asked for help here and still, I‚Äôve received a few very inappropriate and almost scary messages.  Please be very careful and mindful of the fact that if it seems to good to be true, it is likely not for you.  Also, this sub is for individuals experiencing homelessness and that is likely to be most of the audience for your post.  Many of us can‚Äôt even buy dinner let alone provide shelter for another person.  You might do better in subs geared toward providing things for others. This is more advisement and support of non monetary kind. Good luck to you.
gb64el,,fp4cq3d,I have to agree with Gerbil. I'm a guy, and I haven't posted anything asking for assisitance, just a couple updates on how I am. Obviously, things are rough. However, I've gotten easily a dozen private messages from men "offering assistance".... I assume theres no need for me to elaborate on that, except that its completely unwarranted and unwanted.
gb64el,,fp3z1qn,I just want to clarify my reason for posting in this sub. The reason I chose to post here is because of the very high risk I face of becoming homeless again should I decide to relocate. Once you've been homeless you sort of always feel like you're just one step away from being homeless again even if you're currently housed.  Once homeless, always homeless is the sentiment. I say that because homelessness is an experience like no other and one that you never really forget or truly move on from.  I identify with the homeless community and that's why I posted here. These are my brothers.
g9klmx,fouugak,,I'm happy to answer some questions,   a regular night differs for each person but for my wife and I we drive our car to one of a few parking lots we've found are safe and peaceful and go to sleep.   We became homeless because we had nowhere else to go but had to leave our residence due to extensive abuse from someone living there.   We have family that has been helping how they can but all of our family is too far away and/or doesn't have the space and money to take us in.   The pandemic has made a few things much harder, the gyms we used to shower at have closed down as have the libraries that we would hang out at and charge our devices. We were also college students and we had to drop our classes for the semester and no longer had acess to campus and all the things it offered.  As for the devices we had good phones and computers before we became homeless and it didn't make sense to get rid of them, we are also extremely lucky that my grandmother pays for our phone service.  Hope that helps if you have any other questions feel free to pm me.
g9klmx,,fovd6f3,thank you so much! i think thats it. i hope you and your wife are doing good!
g9klmx,fowj8wf,,Sure, I can answer and good luck with your project.  An average night I am usually sleeping in a car on a street designated for people who don‚Äôt have a home. I prefer parking lots as I feel they‚Äôre safer and less risk of being hit by another car.  Every one of my friends and family are thousands of miles away. I don‚Äôt know anyone else here.  I became homeless due to domestic abuse.  He made us homeless on purpose to keep me from leaving him and kept me homeless because it was a way to control me.  I forgot your other questions, I‚Äôm sorry.
g9klmx,,fp0ec92,Is he gone now?
g9klmx,,fp14z9x,He was gone but he‚Äôs back.  I didn‚Äôt really have other options than to go with him as I didn‚Äôt find another solution. I didn‚Äôt end up with a stimulus check. I‚Äôm apparently not eligible for the independent contractor unemployment.  So, I‚Äôm just sort of stuck until my cats die.  At that time, I‚Äôll try again to leave but right now, I‚Äôm too sick (autoimmune and possibly on my second bout with the virus) and don‚Äôt have the resources to make it on my own.

g7ua8w,fomc8p8,,Btw, you‚Äôre missing a Catholic bowl.  Some Catholics would not want those Methodists or Protestants to get the credit for their charity in your Christian bowl.  They‚Äôd sooner donate to the to the catholic charities‚Äô shelters.
g7ua8w,fokmdmi,,u/chodewarrior76!! Didnt we just argue about something?? Ha ha Nice picture did you take it?

g7y96y,fokj0pc,,UPDATE EVERYONE: I just got a text from my mom saying, ‚ÄúWeird question but is the girl you gave a backpack too black and. in front of *nearest* publix?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  She told me she saw her sitting with the backpack holding a drink cup and eating. I am so happy that she was able to buy a lunch today. I am so glad.
g7y96y,fokb2tu,,As a guy I myself felt saved when I saw the tampons. Also wicked bag design. Your the hero we all hope for :)! Reddit love
g7y96y,fokbcm5,,Hey guys! Yesterday many of you helped me find the courage to follow through with an idea to create a care package for a woman who I‚Äôve seen sitting on the same bench for about a week now. I noticed her there. day after day and felt very concerned. I decided to make her a simple care package in hopes that it could be of help to someone. I placed the items in an old backpack that I cleaned out, and just included some necessities I had on hand including toiletries, wipes, feminine products, sealed package of tylenol/aspirin from my first aid kit, facial mask, towel, $20 cash, some snacks like meal bars, crackers, and water, and a note just explaining my thoughts. Kept it super brief. This morning I drove by the store I‚Äôve seen her in front of and she wasn‚Äôt there. I went ‚Äúokay,‚Äù and hoped she found a safe place to go and figured I‚Äôd keep the bag incase I ever encounter a similar situation. I went in to shop for about half an hour and when I started walking to my car I noticed she was there. I got the bag from my car and walked over to her, trying to not be weird or scary so I hope she wasn‚Äôt weirded out. I told her I was thinking of her and asked if she‚Äôd be comfortable taking the care package, letting her know there were some basic things and also some things in the side pockets. She apprehensively took it and thanked me. She was a bit stand-offish but I can‚Äôt imagine how I may feel in her situation. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to be invasive or presumptuous but asked her if there was a meal or anything else I could get her. She said no thank you and before I left I asked if she had a safe place to go. Her response was, ‚ÄúYes. Sort of. Not really. I‚Äôm waiting for a ride and my money I guess. It‚Äôs complicated. I can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù I let her know that I just hope she is safe and that she has a good day. She asked, ‚ÄúAre you okay? You look young.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay. Yes, a lot of people say that. I‚Äôm in my twenties.‚Äù She smiled and sat on the bench with the bag next to her. I am not sure how honest she was about waiting for a ride. As she‚Äôs been there with the same socks on and with the same shopping bag for awhile now, so I just hope she is okay soon. She was also reading a bible, which I noted because in the note I had said ‚ÄúGod bless you.‚Äù and hoped that wouldn‚Äôt be offensive. She didn‚Äôt look inside the bag while I was there but I hope that what little is in there can help her or someone out in some way. :)
g7y96y,fol88zg,,Thanks for following thru. I'm homeless rn but when I'm housed I carry around a pack of socks and a ten, I can only afford to give it out every other day. But everyone involved gets a little happy in the exchange.
g7y96y,fokasky,,You're so sweet! I've been following your story a bit-how was she today?
g7y96y,,fokbhil,Wrote a full thing in the comments. She was a bit apprehensive and stand-offish, but I am in no position to judge. Young girls have to protect ourselves and I know that when anyone approaches me I sometimes put a guard up. I hope the little I could give is able to help just a bit.
g7y96y,,fokfccw,I hope she realizes the spirit in which the gift was given :)  I've been on both ends of that spectrum-sending good vibes to both parties :)
g7y96y,fol4dvz,,This is awesome. Thank you so much for being a kind human being to someone in need. Acknowledge alone is appreciated, but actually reaching out to help is incredible.
g7y96y,fol0l64,,I've been on both ends and I just want to say thank you and thank everyone like you. Its more than words can express how far a little kindness can go
g7y96y,folygk0,,God Bless You, OP! I only hope to do half as kind thing you did for less fortunate in near future :)
g7y96y,fopf1lq,,This is incredibly kind of you!  Very thoughtful contents plus, Vera bags make excellent pillows for quick naps. Both my cats and I know from experience!!!
g7y96y,forhx5r,,Think about this op, this post only got 100 upvotes. Nobody really cares. Thanks for caring. You a cool mfer
g7y96y,fozkgn1,,Very inspiring. Thank you! :)
g7dwy1,fogldkx,,Go for it. Receiving help is one of the hardest things for a human to learn, but we must all learn it.
g7dwy1,fogqg0g,,even if she isnt homeless she will most likely appreciate it if shes STILL wearing the same socks. and if she has millions of socks but for some reason chose to wear them on a rainy day she can probably find someone else to give it to. just do it. it wouldnot hurt at all.
g7dwy1,,fogqogl,yeah. they‚Äôre yellow hospital socks. that‚Äôs how i noticed cause they are so bright. i think i‚Äôm definitely going to put together a little something for her.
g7dwy1,,foh6qr5,[removed]
g7dwy1,,fohib93,I never knew about this.  my god.
g7dwy1,,fokl70t,[deleted]
g7dwy1,fogon7c,,No i don‚Äôt think that comes across as rude at all, i think she‚Äôd really appreciate that. even someone just sitting to talk to her for a couple minutes might make a huge difference. you sound like a very nice person for thinking about her.
g7dwy1,fogstte,,I think that would be really nice. Back when I first became homeless, I struggled to afford basic essentials and would have been really grateful for something like this. Anything helps and little acts like this can really brighten up the day for somebody that is homeless.
g7dwy1,fogrc8n,,Very sweet thought and action on your part so far. I recommend sitting down with her and talking to her in the same way you have communicated with this sub. Instead of assuming she needs toothpaste, etc it might be better to find out directly from the source: her. Keep up the good work, you‚Äôre a cool guy.
g7dwy1,,fogrtds,Since it is by a grocery besides some money I‚Äôd like to ask her about a hot meal. Good thought on not assuming, I just have a family pack of toothpaste and toothbrushes so figured I‚Äôd throw it in and feminine products because I‚Äôm a girl and know that may be hard to ask for. I want to ask if there‚Äôs a meal she‚Äôd like instead of just deciding that she ‚Äúlikes this‚Äù or that because many people can‚Äôt eat certain foods either. Tomorrow morning I‚Äôll run by and do this.
g7dwy1,,fogtj1x,I stand corrected: you‚Äôre a cool person. It sounds like you‚Äôre going to have a great time tomorrow chatting with her. Please keep us posted on how it goes if you‚Äôre up for it.  Also, I happened to creep your profile and your food looks delicious! Maybe she‚Äôll coincidentally prefer something you know how to make. You got this.
g7dwy1,,fogu71l,The worst part is there is a bridge near me where a lot of homeless people live and it‚Äôs freaking illegal to make them food. It would be way more cost effective in terms of feeding people healthy meals, and way more people!! My dad and I were thinking of making some food and bringing it to the people there and found out we‚Äôd get arrested. I get it because some awful people may taint food or something but it is just so saddening to think that anyone would ever do that. My dad keeps bags of chips and soda in his car when he works by there since it‚Äôs prepackaged and gives it out when he can. Thank you. I will definitively be doing this. God bless you!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è you are so sweet
g7dwy1,,foh019q,That sounds like a law that was made to be broken. It‚Äôs amazing to me the ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù our society is willing to legislate. You‚Äôll be glad you did this (and thanks!)
g7dwy1,,foitrvd,There used to be a similar ordinance here in Philly area a few years back. Activists fought it and it got removed, but, we broke the law and fed people anyway many times and we didn‚Äôt find ourselves in any trouble. We did it on a large scale and still did not get hassled. So, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about getting in trouble with the law.
g7dwy1,,foituj4,I am cautious because I‚Äôm in the South and our police are really no nonsense. I appreciate that in many ways because it keeps us safe but it still sucks to worry about giving food to people in need.
g7dwy1,,foiu7mo,Just practice discretion, and I think you‚Äôll be okay.  I think the key is to not draw attention to yourself.  I would like to think the police have bigger things to worry about and could be understanding in these troubling times. Either way, good on you for helping this young woman! I am sure along with some necessities, you will be delivering her much needed hope!
g7dwy1,,foimydr,Yes, sanitary products are so hard to keep in stock at shelters!
g7dwy1,fograk5,,I'd say definitely go through with it. I was homeless and it meant the world to me to receive a bit of kindness. I've been moved to tears over a can of soda before so I guess I'd say to go for it.
g7dwy1,fogxalt,,If you're a man, be very cautious and try to communicate that you have no hidden motives.  Grocery gift cards are great. Also, socks and a tube of anti-fungal creme go a long way. Depending on the person a prepay debit card may be good.
g7dwy1,,fogyirq,I am a 21 year old girl. She appears to be between 20-24
g7dwy1,foh2akk,,I‚Äôve done something similar with a woman who seemed to live by my office. I always asked if she‚Äôd like the thing I had for her (an umbrella, some food, etc.) so I suggest that you ask your girl rather than just hand her the items. My lady always took what I gave her and seemed happy but she turned down my coworker who offered her a pair of pants and shoes. So just be prepared for her to say no.
g7dwy1,,foh2gmb,Got it! If anything I‚Äôm telling myself, ‚ÄúKeep s a care package in your car at all times. You NEVER know when you may see someone who needs these things.‚Äù
g7dwy1,fogxfrw,,Give her a big sandwich, a can of Coke,and a bottle of water. Also give her some fresh socks. That will cost about 20bucks. if she takes it she really really needs it. If she doesn't take it just leave it there come back in an hour and I very someone that Truly needs it will have snatched it up.
g7dwy1,,fogz28s,i like the idea of these kinds of acts of kindness. there is always someone who can use a drink, food, and socks. you never know who
g7dwy1,fohkol6,,How about just ask her, "How are you?", then go from there. Give her your name and ask for hers.   Ask her if there is anything you can get her in the store. She may be staying at a shelter that puts clients out on the street in the morning with whatever they possess.    She might be getting food and other bare necessities, but might need other things (socks, unders, personal care products, etc.). Get her a mask, if you can. A sleeping mask and ear plugs might help her sleep.
g7dwy1,foh8974,,I‚Äôd do it. I would just position it as wanting to brighten her day. If she divulges her situation then go from there.  If she does tell you she is homeless and she needs help finding services, this group could help find stuff for her. I am in Massachusetts and could help if she happens to be around here.   Good luck!
g7dwy1,,fohnj0t,We are in the south. If she is homeless, i am going to look into sources. I know where a womens shelter is where i went to a while back. As well as a few others.
g7dwy1,fogu7br,,Yes, I think this would be something warm-hearted to do.  It's very touching you want to help.    That said, probably worth self-confirming all your intentions are good.  That is, if what is driving this is empathy and kindness, go for it,.  Worth also checking to see if there might be anything else driving it (not saying there is).  If there's some attraction or dream about saving this person, or desire for friendship, then probably good to think through that first and decide if it's still in the best interests of this person.
g7dwy1,,fogvh5m,Definitely not interested in that. She‚Äôs a girl who looks to be about my age (I am also a girl) and I just think of how fearful I would be in that situation and the safety of someone at this time in this area. I‚Äôm definitely not capable of saving anyone. I really don‚Äôt have a lot but I‚Äôve just realized the small blessings I have should be shared if I can I suppose. A year and a half or so ago my life was a lot worse than it was right now and I remember that any act of kindness brought me a lot of hope and strength in really bad times
g7dwy1,,fogy8z4,Sounds like your intentions are in the right place.  Go for it :)
g7dwy1,foi44v4,,You are so kind.
g7dwy1,fohifge,,Why not just ask her if she needs anything, or if you can do anything to help?
g7dwy1,fohm79m,,A sturdy reusable poncho, a small fleece blanket, a large used college book bag backpack, a bottle of water, pocket mirror with a hair brush on one side $1 at Dollar Tree, travel size personal care products take up less space and weigh less.  A clear cigarette lighter, a P-38 GI can opener, a camping spork, wet wipes, a plain sponge in a zip lock bag, a small package of tissue paper  A very small AM/FM battery operated radio with ear phone so she can quietly keep up with weather conditions.   Sunglasses, a hat with a brim that covers the ears.  Thank you for thinking of her.  Ask her what she needs.
g7dwy1,,fohncza,Ok. So far I have gathered a toothpaste tube, closed package of maxi pads, toothbrush, small bar of soap, small pack of baby wipes, and I plan on throwing my old book bag in the wash to store it in. Definitely will throw in some water and closed granola bar, $20 cash (gotta get cash back tomorrow), I am trying to find extra socks otherwise I will try and purchase some too. I may have a poncho as well. And I‚Äôm definitely going to try and sit down and see if she wants to talk or needs a hot meal/any assistance/other items. Thank you so much.
g7dwy1,fohvf3j,,Yeah bro definitely do it if you feel its the right thing. I hate when people say " they might buy drugs with cash." If you're worried about that than don't give. Like i think its shitty to assume every homeless person is an addict and b if you are thinking about it that much than you probably don't have it to give. (This is not directed at OP)   If you can get some socks for them thats literally such a necessity. Nothing better than getting fresh socks. You seem like a good person and I hope you make her day.
g7dwy1,,fohy0wh,My best friend literally assumes all homeless people are drug addicts and called me an idiot for wanting to give her cash. I highly doubt this girl is. It‚Äôs not my place to judge or choose what she buys. I will definitely give her some cash
g7dwy1,,foi0kct,Yeah thats awesome. I mean lets say inevitably she does buy drugs. You may have saved her from having to do things she didn't wanna do for money. Even if its a minor temporary relief its a relief nonetheless
g7dwy1,,foi0zhj,Tbh my brother is a recovering heroine addict and this girl doesn‚Äôt really exhibit any of the behavior or characteristics. He was homeless and went off the grid for a bit until my Auntie found him and cleaned up the apartment she inherited, gave it to him. He lives there now for about 5 years. He‚Äôs been sober too for most of that. One relapse but he got help. She didn‚Äôt have room for him to stay long in her house cause she has three special needs kids, so glad he is ok now. I know if i hadnt known him and saw him on the street years ago, i wouldve wanted him to have a few dollars so he wouldnt sell his body at least. I remember him being so fearful after it all ended about the possibility of hiv.
g7dwy1,fohw1k8,,Add some socks to the care package? Not cotton ones; poly, medium weight, is the best choice if you‚Äôre outdoors.    She might like someone to talk to. Maybe have a chat with her? Listen to her story if she is willing to share it?
g7dwy1,foi0dh0,,If your making a care package and she doesn't have a backpack then that should be one of the item you get her. A good backpack makes all the difference when you're homeless
g7dwy1,,foi0iw8,I have a used backpack just from senior year of high school. Its a cute purple vera bradley. Very comfortable and a lot of pockets and water bottle holder. Im going to wash it out and give the stuff to her in that
g7dwy1,foim5v3,,It wouldn't be rude at all. Contact any church nearby and they can direct you to resources, they might even have free care packages.
g7dwy1,foirv61,,Look i know people say ask her what she needs, well sometimes even needing hale we are to ashamed to ask.  sanitary napkins yes, some nbars yers, SOCKS yes, tell her after if she can think of something , if i were in that situation i would get the socks and the sanitary mapkins, and ever a 9 $ package of panties with so much appreciation... People , really it is horrible to say oh yes i need this , most people just feel like we are failure and we don't want to incomodase other person... Your carepcakage envenen√≥ if you have a car, anyone would appreciate it, and is need it.. if she wants to ask for a better bag? right now a lot of places to get help are closed!
g7dwy1,foju1q4,,Go for it!! Either way it will make her day and she will pass the kindness on! I used to always give to the homeless and help people where i could. Its so amazing to watch/witness the same people go on and do the same for others! As im experiencing homelessness myself now im sure she will appreciate it so much!
g7dwy1,fok1hv1,,pretty great idea
g7bvk7,foghu5c,,For some people, it is a death sentence. Not everyone starts out well enough to finish this journey with a climb back into stability. Not everyone has access to supportive resources or good weather or a safe community.  I think I get your message but it is sort of a slap in the face to those who have died.  Most of the time, they probably tried to live before this life took them out.
g7bvk7,,fogljy3,Some people would rather die.
g7bvk7,,fogr8ms,#***GerbilNippllllllllles!!!!!!***
g7bvk7,fohmkdw,,Let me clarify that I wrote this post not to insult those who are stuck or died; or make homelessness seem easy. I want people reading this post during this time of losing everything due to uncontrollable events (coronavirus affecting economy) that homelessness should not be a terror. Get help, keep warm, be fed, and make friends/community. Having money/status is not the meaning of life and does not define your worth as a human.
g7bvk7,foi0ovi,,Winter always turns to Spring. All the best to you too.
g7bvk7,fomq23s,,wtf. only like 1-2% of homeless in the us die each year. ~98% survival rate is never a "death sentence" even if you're exaggerating for dramatic effect.
g5wua0,fo5ztoj,,Extremely likely.  Especially with the increased security and person count at every store I‚Äôve been to during the pandemic.
g5wua0,fo631vw,,Best thing to do is find a food pantry.
g5wua0,,foc12t0,Or panhandle. Or he could even ask the manager of the store for a meal or a few groceries. I've been helped out by kroger, publix and whole foods directly.   Just go in there, explain your situation. You might even tell them that you were considering stealing but decided to ask instead. I had told a manager once with success something to the effect of "Look, I'm broke and I don't really want to have to panhandle in front your store to get a bite, could you possibly help me out?" I also travel though and that fact is very apparent with my gear. They realize I won't be back to ask for food again.

g5wua0,foetlw8,,Stealing food is usually not that hard, just don‚Äôt be nervous or stupid. Go in wearing your appropriate mask etc. I also recommend carrying a mostly empty messenger style bag. Get a basket. As you move through the aisles casually slip items into your messenger bag. I suggest this kind of bag because it sits at the height where your hand would naturally fall so it is not an awkward eye-catching movement to drop items into the bag. Don‚Äôt look at the hand putting things in the bag, look at the items on the shelf, this will also draw attention away from the movement. I like to wait until an aisle is empty and keep walking as I drop items into the bag. If you don‚Äôt even have money for a small ‚Äúcover purchase‚Äù you can still ring up a couple items and then give the cashier a card that you know is going to decline. When it does act embarrassed, mumble something about having to check with your bank and tell them you‚Äôll be back. Or when it‚Äôs time to pay you could discover that you left your wallet in the car. Another good exit strategy is to ask an employee near the door for an item they don‚Äôt carry or are out of. This way they will not question why you‚Äôre leaving with nothing. Good luck, remember it‚Äôs better to get out with *something* than to get caught trying to get too much.
g5wua0,,g2ibabg,I fill up my bag, go to the pharmacy and pick up my prescription and walk out w the prescription in my hand as if that‚Äôs all I came for.   Plus that store is usually a pretty busy one so that probably means it‚Äôs easier than an emptier store right?
g5wua0,,ijsr7cc,"remember it‚Äôs better to get out with something than to get caught trying to get too much."   Golden advice right here my comrade. Fuck over these tax-evading corporations!
g5wua0,fo6gk0e,,This post makes me sad. I am almost in the same place re: thinking about having to steal to keep from dying. Before this last 5-weeks of hell, I never would have considered it. Day after day after day of not getting any help - told I am not eligible for unemployment, homeless, wet, cold, hungry all the time - no shower in 37 days now. I dunno.....it seems like there are no other options.
g5wua0,,fo7mxcl,Hit up Nextdoor, if you're able to, and ask neighbors for food. You are surrounded by many people who want to help out where they can.
g5wua0,,fo88eed,Do you think eating food while you're still in the store will work? You can maybe eat a few chocolate bars in the store and nobody will notice
g5wua0,,fo8cirr,You must use your own wise discretion between knowing when to ask for permission and when to ask for forgiveness.
g5wua0,,fo91m2v,If you are  not eligible for regular unemployment you should qualify for the PUA. You could have been starting a job or even done something simple part time . Food stamps? Food banks?
g5wua0,,fohscg0,How much is the PUA?
g5wua0,,foi6y38,$167 plus $600 in CA. Different for every state but the $600 is at least for 4 months. (Weekly)
g5wua0,,fo6jxg2,Sadly alot of us who arent homeless are considering it. Never stole in my life but walked out w a bag of milanos i "forgot" to ring up at self checkout stand lol. Then next time i only had 3 dollars was planning to just buy cheap bread but tried to think about doing same thing with cereal. It sucks but these states are not dispensing the aid correctly.

g5wua0,fo8skgx,,search food not bombs see if theyre in your area  barring that fly a sign near fast food joints youre guaranteed to get fed fast üôÇ
g5wua0,fo8eqd1,,i used to show up at fastfood places near closing time and just kinda lay it on the line. worked about 50% of the time. some days nothing then a few others were jackpots. walked away with 10 lbs of popeys chicken one time and a dozen whopper pattys another.  if that doesnt work i would hit up supermarket and fast food dumpsters some days, like with little ceasers here you walk awsy with more food then you could ever eat.  supermarkets here toss tons of fruit and veggies.  you do you but it would suck coppin a charge for a snickers
g5wua0,foeg5ad,,I'd say if you walked around with a cart and grabbed about 50 worth of essentials and just act like you are in the phone taking tea and walk out the door. Load up the car it walk away. I be would not attempt this on foot. I wouldn't do it on purpose but I did accidentally forget to pay once talking on the phone in the grocery, didn't realize I forgot to pay till I was putting stuff in the fridge wondering why they didn't bag my stuff up... So I packed it all back up and went back to the store since it was my regular store and I'd rather like to be welcome back... They called the cops after I explained the situation. So I left without any food but just don't go back and you'll probably be solid
g5wua0,fo91qw5,,There are food banks that will accept you as a single person or tell them your dads situations. Also try for food stamps and get away from  Your father as soon as you can.
g5wua0,,fo92f1d,I applied for food stamps this afternoon. I went to the food bank today but they were out of items
g5wua0,,fo98xzq,Ok keep trying and call tomorrow in the morning. Tell them it‚Äôs an emergency and you can get them expedited. Go to the food bank again, up early
g5wua0,,ijsqucd,Out of items ? That is just not right...   Im sorry for you and those in your situation. That is just not right at all...
g5s1mh,fo58ajj,,Most likely going forward Im going to pivot to single item cooking (so like just the steak by itself or the veggies by themselves and thats it) because while I didnt have any issues cooking where I was, it did take a while to do everything and Im just too lazy to bother lol.   Not only will it be quicker and easier to clean up, but Ill be able to do it with less a chance of being bothered about it.    And as for the meal, it was only about $5 to make the plate. The steak was $3 and the veggies came out around $2. Not too bad considering I otherwise would have spent double on arguably shitty fast food.
g5s1mh,,fo6590o,Its also a one off meal; One steak as opposed to a pound of hamburger that you can only eat so much of in a day , the rest going to spoil for lack of refrigeration.  Hot cooked meals are great if they are for one. A cup of soup, can of beans, potato.  Otherwise its a loaf of bread and peanut butter / honey, or box of crackers and brick o cheese.  I remember the most important thing was filling your belly, the homeless body is efficient engine at taking up available nutrients. Playing chef for a multi course meal was a lot of xtra work.
g5s1mh,,fo5itln,[removed]
g5s1mh,,fo5v4m9,You really think they're homeless because they spent $5 on a meal?  And it's a meal that's relatively healthy, protein and veggies. Sure, you can go cheaper with a meal, do beans and rice, pasta, or pb&j, but it's not saving them that much money, and eating that diet all the time can have negative consequences. If all you eat are cheap starches you're not getting the proper nutrition, and poor nutrition can had an enormous effect on someone's physical and mental health.  Really, spending $5 for this meal is incredibly thrifty for what they're getting.
g5s1mh,,fo5wc3k,Do you ever wonder if you can see underwater?
g5s1mh,,fo5r00t,Sounds just about like your typical gta online player, yikes
g5s1mh,,fo601nw,Ever wonder why no one loves you?
g5s1mh,fo5bds4,,That looks super tasty!
g5s1mh,fo6czn6,,Hey OP anyway you can cook the steak and keep the veggies in some foil or something close to the heat? Might not get searing on them but still would be two birds one stone.  Speaking of bird I remember one technique I used when I was homeless occasionally if the circumstance fit.  I'd have a campfire for warmth/coffee and maybe some quick breakfast in the morning. After a while I would remove a large rock from the fire ring and let it cool for like 5 minutes just a little. I'd wrap the rock in a couple bath towels. I'd take a well wrapped Cornish hen in foil and place the chicken and the hot rock in a back pack and shove some other fabric in as added insulation.   Depending on how got the rock is it would cook my chicken in 2-4 hours. Almost like a slow roast.  Just a modified version of burying a pig in coals I suppose but it was quick and easy.  Also another live saver was cowboy coffee. For those that are unaware it's coffee made without a coffee maker or instant coffee. Adding cold water after brewed gets the coffee grounds to sink the to bottom and then you can pour into a cup and mostly be coffee ground free .  Use a sauce pan or whatever and just bring your grounds and water to a low simmer for a couple minutes, remove from heat and let sit a minute, pour in a coffee cup worth or cold water slowly, 30 seconds and then pour slowly out into cup.  Seriously this makes a great cup of coffee. My technique might be shit but it works for me. Some folks swear by cowboy coffee.   Honestly it was the one thing that really made my wife feel normal and comforting while we were homeless.   Morale is important and it's even better when it's good food. Glad you eating good OP.  Sometimes it's truly the little things.  Stay healthy, stay safe.
g5s1mh,,fo90jwq,After simmering, couldn't you simply pour it into a cup with a coffee filter and rubber band? Coffee filters are under a cent a piece, and the rubber band is reusable.
g5s1mh,fo5cfpc,,Lol..fix me a plate..looks so good :)
g5s1mh,fo6gtjb,,As someone who hasn't had a hot meal in 12 years, this picture looks like a heaven that is out of reach. Sometimes I can let the sun heat up a can if I let it sit all day long. The thing I miss the  most is ice cream. I used to love ice cream and have it every night.

g4d82u,fnwrzy1,,Hey just wanna add some food for thought but consider digging some sumps off to either side of your walkway to prevent flooding. Looks good
g4d82u,,iql2qlc,very good idea.   Ensure that all things in this place have some sort of 'slope' that allows water to flow down to the outsides.   Then you will have to set up a run off water system so that the water doesn't pool in one place. Make sure this gutter leads quite far away from your home cause the water could pool into the soil and become groundwater then it could attakc the intergrity of your home OP
g4d82u,fnyid1p,,The Viet Cong darn near built small cities underground. Do a search on Cu Chi Tunnels. If done correctly, you guys could live underground for decades undetected. If you guys have winter where you're at you're gonna have to go well below the frost line but stay above the water table. I knew a guy who bought some land and did just this. He lived underground for years and years. He legit had rooms and all. just like a house without windows. He was a mean cuss. Spent most of his life alone. You'd pull up to his property and all you could see was a field of weeds. It was pretty crazy.
g4d82u,,iqjuclj,This man said Cuchi tunnels. I got got caught up in some hard battles in several Cuchi tunnels. The bush around Cuchi tunnels was ruff and wet.
g4d82u,fnwucjb,,I've been obsessed with tunnels ever since that Pete & Pete episode where little Pete tunnels from his house to under the street
g4d82u,,fnyiq9m,Didnt he use a statue to dig and something with the sprinklers for air or light or something
g4d82u,fnx8kye,,Very good work but be careful because posted images like this can be data mined for meta data that if taken by phone might include location data or other revealing details. If the pigs get wind of this they might turn up in force to evict. Just saying. Else wise hella cool. I suggest taking a look at the "primitive technologies underground hut" and a few other related youtube videos. There's some really great methods for further concealing your construction and doing so with live flora that would help truly make you invisible.
g4d82u,,fnyrfky,Pretty sure reddit removes all exif data.
g4d82u,,fnyzqh4,I wouldn't be so sure, Reddit has made a point of logging all IP addresses both past and present that a username connects from and provides them to the pigs without need for a warrant.
g4d82u,,fnz1pe5,ahh, referencing that one case where a white dude posted that he was going to go kill black kids in harlem as revenge for a white girl getting stabbed and killed. right?
g4d82u,,fo5odfn,[deleted]
g4d82u,,fo60nsx,well you obviously replied to the wrong person, mister computer guy
g4d82u,,folqlwf,As a non computer person, what's the easiest way to remove this type of data before I post videos? I've only posted a couple motorcycle related videos to a motorcycle sub but I've heard warnings about people finding your location to steal cars, motorcycles, and anything of value. I assume it's the same reason why people block their license plates in pictures.
g4d82u,,folshai,[deleted]
g4d82u,,folupaf,Okay that's good to know. I have that option on my phone turned off already so that gives me peace of mind.  In regards to changing the format that it was originally recorded in, would editing the video through a third party app count?  That's fascinating, so it's like a reverse image search for videos? I can imagine how much more sophicated these search engines will be once object recognition is integrated. Bixby on my phone is fairly accurate already. It's another step close to AI.
g4d82u,,folvcbe,[deleted]
g4d82u,,folxl6b,Got it thanks for the info! This is something that should be covered in middle school. This next generation is so comfortable with posting their locations and they're unknowingly putting themselves in danger. My wife and I will definitely be giving our son a lecture on this subject now. Thanks againü§ò
g4d82u,fnyb65o,,Nothing quite like digging your own grave.
g4d82u,,fnz3l49,Lmfao
g4d82u,fnxsit0,,Ever since i was a kid I've thought underground shit was cool. Super enamored by those ppl that dig from mexico into usa. Read about that homeless British dude that made an underground camp but was later found out and jailed.  So, im wondering...is there a subreddit for that?   Cheers on ur camp OP. Live your live...fuck the haters.
g4d82u,,fnyh49r,that dude is my hero  Free him!!! ü•∞
g4d82u,,hm9dbut,Heya, I‚Äôd be interested to hear if you found any subreddits/forums about this? I‚Äôm not homeless, I‚Äôm just browsing, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing this at all. Houses here in London - where I‚Äôve lived all my life and where all my friends and family are - are about ¬£1m for a totally average terraced house: e.g. [these Zoopla search results](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/houses/london/).   I‚Äôm not too badly off (¬£180k/yr TC, around ¬£600k total equity between two companies, one public and one private) so I could _just about_ afford somewhere, but it just strikes me as such an absolutely preposterous amount of money to spend on an utterly ordinary little house - and anything actually remarkable/nice would probably mean paying off a mortgage over a decade or more. (My grandparents bought their old house for ¬£11k in the early 70s, and it sold for ¬£9m, if that gives you a sense of how absolutely ludicrous the prices are.)  I watched a YouTube video a while ago of a guy carving a mud hut - complete with swimming pool - in what looked like a few hours, and I think that really crystallised this sense that I don‚Äôt want to labour for decades to pay off something I could build in a few days. If there‚Äôs anywhere dedicated to this, I‚Äôd be really interested üôè
g4d82u,,i2qj6f3,I saw that guy as well.Pretty impressive for sure .
g4d82u,,i2r6bay,Yeah, really impressive! And, for me, it did more than anything else to _really make me understand_ the fatuity of how most people work for their entire lives to pay off mortgages of hundreds of thousands ‚Äì more than many people would make in a hundred lifetimes ‚Äì to pay for not a luxurious mansion, but just an ordinary box in a row of boxes, arguably _far less pleasant than that guy‚Äôs mud hut_. It‚Äôs insane. It‚Äôs absolutely insane.  Like, I understand the need to have somewhere warm to dwell, but, for me, I‚Äôd say the state should expropriate all excessive landholdings (enormous golf courses, enormous farms beyond necessity, mere estates that people don‚Äôt even use, etc), subdivide them into small lots that people are given free of charge (neediest first), and, in return for that, they would have a justification for claiming a reasonable tax on people‚Äôs earnings.   That makes sense to me. The Earth is everyone‚Äôs patrimony, not just those who happened to be granted land - _in exactly the way I just described anyway_ - five or six centuries ago, or in the US one to three.  And that way, we could all build reasonable dwellings for a _sane_ cost ‚Äî a multiple of the cost of remodelling one‚Äôs kitchen, maybe 30-50k ‚Äî and not slave away our entire lives at miserable jobs just to pay for our huts. The difference in happiness and accomplishment, and art/business/academia/whatever people are interested in, would be immense. For me that kind of policy - Georgism, basically - is far more important and beneficial than something like universal basic income (which is basically just ‚Äúshare that welfare with us rich/middle-class/physically-able people too!‚Äù).
g4d82u,,i2r6e1u,Sorry for the rant‚Ä¶ I write quickly, and I have strong opinions‚Ä¶ üôà
g4d82u,,i2s9wk0,I enjoyed reading it and I agree with so much of what you said
g4d82u,,i2we2hz,Thank you! I don‚Äôt know why these ideas are so uncommon, obviously. I agree with the communists‚Äô / socialists‚Äô sense that the system is unjust and the poor are being exploited, but I think their analysis is _confusingly obviously_ off the mark. We _should_ reward hard work and effort and creating wealth - the injustice that needs remedying is not the people who worked to create wealth for themselves, but the people who benefit from controlling resources (land: in the economists‚Äô sense, i.e. all natural resources including oil, gas, minerals, etc) that rightly belong to all of us as Earth-citizens.  That‚Äôs what we need: not a society where everyone is forced to work, or where the industrious are effectively enslaved to the lazy, but one where everyone owns common resources equally, and those who are clever and hardworking enough to transform them into more valuable things can improve their lives by doing that for their share (and for non-permanent non-primary-resource payment - e.g. crops but not farmland - from others).  Obviously that‚Äôs the ideal form of the philosophy: the vitiated pragmatic form is one where we base taxes not on the product of people‚Äôs work but on the common resources they appropriate/control to make their money. That‚Äôs my take, at least. But certainly I think a certain amount of expropriation/redistribution is realistic, to effect the kind of land grants that I mentioned above.  (I‚Äôm not writing this for a reply, btw - it‚Äôs interesting just to explore the thoughts ‚Äòout loud‚Äô / on paper)
g4d82u,,i2wea5x,Sorry - that ‚Äúnot the people who worked hard to get rich, but the people who benefit from common resources‚Äù is a bit poorly worded. Obviously in a huge number - probably a majority - of cases those who are rich did both. But my point is it‚Äôs the latter thing which is the injustice, not the former.

g4d82u,,fnx09oq,Those branches on the top are attached to a tarp that pull overhead of the underground community.  If someone walks by they wouldnt even see anything. And as for rain, again, theres tarp covering it. We also have a tubing system that excess water can flow thru

g2zp16,fnpcmk6,,Give away everything you own...then throw away your birth certificate, ID, social security card. Make sure your family or friends bridges are burned. Hey I‚Äôve never felt more free in my life. Then try to get all those things again. All the while keeping yourself clean, properly rested and fed. I‚Äôve done it 20 times. It‚Äôs easy.  Edit: more like 12 times
g2zp16,fnpulgz,,You should just lurk in this sub everyday for a month or scroll into the past. It‚Äôs all there man. This shit is real in here. That‚Äôs what I would do. We aren‚Äôt going to make it easy on you. https://nlchp.org this link has tons of PDFs that you can download and read that are very detailed about what is happening in the U.S. I used it when researching homelessness and public policy for a documentary and a radio show which are both defunct.
g2zp16,fnq7who,,If your audience is mostly people who haven‚Äôt been homeless, they won‚Äôt know the difference. This isn‚Äôt something you can convey with words or even data.  The experience is opposite human instinct and many people won‚Äôt even be able to process it as a reality. That‚Äôs why we get people dehumanizing the population.  I‚Äôm capable, functional, and experienced in a disciplined that serves the homeless population. Still, when it happened to me, I was a clueless Bambi trying to walk on ice.  I‚Äôm still figuring shit out and it has been 3 years. Just write to entertain because as someone who hasn‚Äôt lived it, you have no well from which to water any seeds planted by our stories.  Even if you did, as I said, the scope of your message would be lost on most of your readers.
g2zp16,fnpjtyt,,Write what you know lol. Don't have a car, put all identification somewhere safe that you don't have immediate access to. Spend your money on a backpack, sleeping bag, tarp, paracord, and a good multi tool. Now go out on the streets and spend a week in a familiar city. After that find a busy on ramp, stick your thumb out and spend a year traveling the country hitchhiking homeless. By the time you're done the story will write itself, and if it doesn't you're doing it wrong.
g2zp16,fnomgb4,,You want to get inspiration for free and then profit off it. Use your own imagination and stop exploiting the vunerable.
g2zp16,fnr33nz,,lol i love this!!!  Steinbecks characters in Tortilla Flat, Grapes of Wrath, and Cannery Row were homeless  Steinbeck did a great job in Tortilla Flat of describing us with dignity and humor  Homelessness doesnt have to be shitty  OP watch Artopium Mikes videos on youtube hes an absolute inspiration to all homeless: a guy who rises above his mental illnesses, struggles, and makes it
g2zp16,fnr396f,,In my experience with homelessness, anyone who CAN get away with taking advantage of the vulnerable, WILL take advantage of the vulnerable.   While I was attending a misdemeanor court there was a a man facing the charge of "Setting up an abode on public property". It is literally a crime to sleep in public, to be homeless.   The other day I saw a homeless man sleeping out in the field across the street from a grocery store. An ambulance and fire truck showed up. Apparently someone called an emergency number thinking the man was possibly dead or ill. No sooner than the emergency crew had arrived and confirmed the man was physically 'okay' they were jumping back into their trucks to leave. No offer of help. No assistance getting to a shelter. Nothing but, "okay you have a pulse, goodbye".  Nobody cares about the homeless. They're just fodder for the criminal justice system. We're not people, we're just inanimate objects for society to exploit and abuse and then kick us to the curb when we're no longer of any use to you.  Just my opinion. That grocery store I mentioned before...... Less than a mile from there sits the largest mansion of a house I have ever seen anywhere, ever! Those people must be filthy rich. There are always people panhandling in the parking lot of the grocery store. Less than a mile away from a mansion. I panhandled there a couple times. Didn't get much.   You can probably sense my frustration. It's sad. Just sad. I don't know what else to say. Glad I didn't have any children. Glad to be on my way out of this shitty world cuz it sucks!
g2rhs7,fnoqhvp,,I found it but I can't get past the initial info. It wants my social and address. It won't accept anything I put in. I'm so discouraged. I could really use this money like everyone else. The guys around me already got it and went and threw a freaking party. I got bills. It makes me angry.
g2rhs7,fnnrzt2,,Hmm, okay, I‚Äôm getting frustrated that I can‚Äôt just copy and paste the link to give you, but I‚Äôm on mobile and the YouTube app apparently only lets you click links in descriptions but not copy them...and they open like within the app still or something and I still can‚Äôt actually copy the link even once it‚Äôs open.  ANYWAY, if you go to this Philip Defranco video:   https://youtu.be/O8PPPE6tso4  The link you need is in the video description/info. I did it successfully yesterday, but I‚Äôve been hearing the portal is getting overwhelmed with activity so it might take a few tries to get it to load/work.

g2rhs7,fnq97f2,,Hey, I‚Äôm in your situation. From what I‚Äôve been told, we have a very small window to add it.  Only check once a day or you‚Äôll be locked out.  When you check get my money, eventually, it will say your payment is processed and ask for your banking info or correct address.  As long as you update it before it gets mailed, it will be sent via direct deposit. The problem is that some people are saying these could be months out; like 20 weeks.  We will certainly be next to last to receive funds based on what I‚Äôve been told so far about my situation.  Keep checking, though, as I truly don‚Äôt think anyone knows wtf is going on.  Stay strong, I‚Äôm in the same boat and it isn‚Äôt sinking just yet.
g2rhs7,,fnsugir,keep checking the "Get my payment" tab at IRS .com?

g1t26n,fnmvder,,My jimmies are slightly rustled that you may be hinting people haven‚Äôt advocated or effectively communicated or tried hard enough to make politicians aware of the need.  People can demand change all day but if the people in power don‚Äôt want to do something, they‚Äôre not going to do it.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what we say when the problem is, mostly, that we are an out of sight, out of mind problem for this country.  Fraud is rampant in populations with clients who tend to have instability.  Why? They often are non compliant and flake.  This opens the door for billing for services never rendered or including them in a count as being served when they‚Äôve never went past intake.  Cities fave line is, ‚Äúwe offered help and they declined the help.‚Äù Usually the people aren‚Äôt rejecting help, there rejecting a specific aspect or requirement that isn‚Äôt willful to them in any way.  So, that‚Äôs off topic but I feel a little like your last statement is almost victim blaming as if we don‚Äôt already scream for help every single day.  During the pandemic, it‚Äôs been worse.  Those things people hoarded are how we functioned.  Baby wipes, paper towels, bottled water, rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, soap; that‚Äôs our shower.  It was scary for a few weeks with no resources.  I‚Äôm not in LA but rumors are that they‚Äôre are slowly getting people hotels.  My county is not doing that and won‚Äôt even allow me testing as an individual who is homeless. I wrote it here yday but I was referred to the hotline by 211 who referred me to my primary care who then, referred me to the hotline and then, back to 211 and back to the hotline; see the problem?  I spent the very last of my emergency money on 3 nights in a hotel.  I‚Äôm lying her sick with fever, cough, and just wiped out.  I‚Äôll be on the street, in the rain, this time tomorrow.  So, I‚Äôm not exactly la but I‚Äôm within an hour‚Äôs drive most days.  Things aren‚Äôt great here and I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll get worse.  For 3 years, people like doctors and nurses and everyone except hospital social workers (who know the limitations) kept telling me I would get help if I asked and just accept the help and go.  That‚Äôs horseshit.  So many of us are invisible by design.  This could have been a chance to elevate some of us back into the real world but now, it‚Äôs just going to be harder to find help as more usually stable people fall into similar financial crises.  That‚Äôs all, it‚Äôs time for more sleep while I have a bed.  The truth is that the only time I get as much as a returned call is when I name drop someone I know or they find out who I used to be; otherwise, most places don‚Äôt even bother calling back with info.   This is my experience and I know it is different for everyone.  Thanks for caring and reaching out.
g1t26n,fnnb744,,My apologies for making it seem that it sounded like i was saying people weren't doing anything. To the contrary, I know lots of advocacy had taken place.  My only desire was too be a part of it by being another voice trying to raise this as an issue.  I did not mean to take away from the hard work of those that have been here before me.  I've been a lobbyist in the state Capitol and in DC for other issues, so I'm aware of the work that needs to go into making change, the people necessary to raise their voices, as well as the many other things needed.  I'll respond to the rest of your message later as I pulled off the road to at least respectfully respond to the past and current advocates.  Hope you're staying safe.
g1uwi7,fnk6i47,,I work at a bank. If the account was from a year ago, it‚Äôs most likely closed and you have a charge off. Good news for you! That means it didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Go to irs.gov and change your info. They can send you a paper check to the address that you choose. It may take longer but you should get itüòä
g1uwi7,,fnkemk7,I thought it was more than likely closed, I told them last year it's just going to have to go to collections. At least I certainly hope it's closed, it's a credit union so not sure if they operate any different. I changed the address at the post office recently in case it came via check.
g1uwi7,,fnn3b01,I think you will most likely get it. Praying for you
g1uwi7,fnhu6g1,,I read the bill. It‚Äôs a federal crime if they use your stimulus money to cover previous debt. Your stimulus check cannot be garnished in any way. They are working on applications to help you recover your money, please hang in there dude. A lot of angry people on twitter had the same thing happen, hundreds, you‚Äôre not alone so the IRS are forced to make it right.  Edit: Sorry for the misinformation, but it seems that private debt collectors CAN garnish your stimulus check. Not because the bill gives them explicit permission, but because of a technical loophole. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this loophole until recently. These weaselly little fucks really will do anything to take money from the hands of people who need it the most.
g1uwi7,,fnimsiy,Yesterday they came out with news that the banks could take money out if it was owed for debts.
g1uwi7,,fnjl2ij,If the check gets deposited into a bank account that has an overdraft at the bank is allowed to take it as of now
g1uwi7,,fni555u,That makes sense, I imagine it did happen to a ton of other people. I guess just the reactionary feeling of seeing it go into the wrong place when I could have had it right now and knowing I could have been in a hotel tonight instead of my black sweatbox got me..but I'll have to calm down and be patient, they'll figure something out.
g1uwi7,,fni9pmp,I also just read this, I will look into it more for you.  But this says if the bank is owed money, they can seize it.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/prospect.org/api/amp/coronavirus/banks-can-grab-stimulus-check-pay-debts/
g1uwi7,,fni95sn,The only debt they can use it for is back child support.
g1uwi7,fnj6t3p,,they will mail your check it gets returned to the irs
g1uwi7,,fnjcrcb,I hope so. Someone gave me an article saying that banks could potentially keep the money if you have a debt with them, but I'm hoping I've been out of the system there long enough where it just goes back to the IRS.
g1uwi7,fnjl0nu,,If it gets deposited into an account that you owe money to then they can take it
g1uwi7,fnn5fqr,,From looking at your post history, it looks like you'd have spent it on meth.
g1uwi7,,fnn6ty2,I used meth once last year, got paranoid when I came down and threw it out. I didn't buy it this time around, I received it in trade with cash on top. Not a bad deal. Not sure what would make you think I use meth on any regular basis from literally one specific post about it, let alone $1,200 worth of the stuff. It's about $60 for a g, pretty sure I'd die before I could exhaust that much dough on the stuff. But you know what, that sounds kinda fun. I'll call it the "stimulus crystal challenge", where I just keep buying grams, use it all up over the course of like 3 days, then next time 2g..then 4g..5g. And see how much of a dent I can make in that stack of cash before my heart explodes or from the combination of no food or sleep. I'll vlog it!
g1uwi7,,fnn7axj,Gotta get your money first!  Not gonna lie though, your reply made me laugh.
g1uwi7,,fnnkeft,I actually did get it today, it went into savings to my old account. I can only draw 500 a day but I definitely lucked out.
g0zfll,fncqmfg,,Sometimes it only takes one person doing one small thing to send us down the right path.  In the future you may look at this as a turning point in your life.  When I was homeless, I could find all the food I needed, had a horrible shelter to stay at, and just enough "help" to keep me homeless.  Then someone gave me a $5 bus pass and an ear to vent in.  It was a stranger I will never see again, but that stranger gave me hope.  With a lot of hard work and effort, I turned that bus pass into a job and apartment.  I did not believe in myself, but the stranger did.  I won't pretend it is easy, and I was not homeless during the pandemic, so I know you have a rough journey.  Here is the secret to getting out.  You make a 1000 mile journey one step at a time.  That cop gave you step one.  Tomorrow, take step 2.  And keep taking steps until you get where you want to go.  Today, maybe you dont believe in yourself.  But I believe in you because I have taken your journey.  Stay strong, accept help, and push forward.
g0zfll,,fncrkcv,Thank you! That cop truly did something I never thought any cop would do. I was expecting the same robotic passive aggressive conversation. But he showed humility, something I haven‚Äôt gotten in a while. I‚Äôm a stubborn person naturally and never was the kind of person to accept help. I know for a fact this is the turning point in my life in which the sin of pride is stripped away from me. That cop looked me in the eyes with sadness and belief in my prevail at the same time. He genuinely hoped the best for me. I can‚Äôt let him or you down. I‚Äôll tackle this journey, for my dreams, for my future, for the family I one day hope to have, just as you said. And your words have only boosted my morale. And the funny thing is, that‚Äôs my name: morale :)
g0zfll,,fnj7rt8,i had a cop straight give me $700 once.. someone reported i was suicidal and he found me..i was stressin'.
g0zfll,,fnjo5m5,That cop just like the one I ran into, has a heart of pure gold. It‚Äôs hard to find people like that these days. I‚Äôm really glad you didn‚Äôt commit suicide tho. And I hope you are doing way better!
g0zfll,fnd7wr7,,Telling stories like this is SO important. It humanizes all the people involved. Thank you for sharing it.
g0zfll,,fndbiyz,My pleasure. I never thought that this story would hit home for so many people! I‚Äôm so grateful for everyone coming together and wishing me well on my journey. It won‚Äôt be easy, but the conversation and humility of the cop, has surely rejuvenated my faith for the future. I can‚Äôt give up on him or you all.Thank YOU for listening to my story :)
g0zfll,,fndq75d,You‚Äôre a good writer. I think you could be employed after this crisis is abated. I think right now it might be a little difficult but there are places that are in need of people to work. Supermarkets and the big box stores are really in need of workers. I wonder if you could get some help from social services. I wish I knew what else to recommend.
g0zfll,,fndunnz,Most of the social service offices around me are unfortunately closed down due to the pandemic. But super markets sound like a really good idea, I‚Äôll try one out near by me and see how it goes! And thank you for the compliment! I‚Äôve been writing various forms of literature, ever since I was a small child. I often would continue, parody, or fanmake stories I loved as a young boy. I still write to this day and even I surprise myself sometimes haha. Thank you also for reading my post. It‚Äôs very much appreciated :)
g0zfll,fndbdf6,,There's a story of a Australian man who's saved countless jumpers simply by offering them a cup of coffee.  It only takes one person to change your path. Glad this cop crossed your path. Godspeed

g0zfll,fnd9m0o,,Why can't you get your money?
g0zfll,,fndaxcj,I was already claimed as a dependent by my mother
g0zfll,,fndcxxb,If you're homeless, your mom shouldn't be claiming you.
g0zfll,,fnexznb,"I‚Äôve only been on the streets officially homeless for a week and living in my car for 2 months"  so entirely in 2020. if op lived with their mom for most of 2019 (among other criteria), op can be claimed as a dependent on 2019 filing. 2020 has no effect on 2019.
g0zfll,,fnfh8bl,I didn't want to assume anything, but you're probably right.
g0zfll,fndhkn4,,Many cops have more contact with homeless than any other civil service.  Some identity with us, some vilify us.  Ive had some save my ass before; others you can feel the menace and hate pouring off.  We can't pigeonhole cops, take them as individuals.
g0zfll,,fndjrdk,Agreed. I cannot lie, as a African American, due to me being polite and wide vocabulary range; I‚Äôve never been mistreated by a cop to the lengths that most other African Americans I know have told me about. I think that police system as a whole, still needs work, and could be better, to not only people but in  stupid situations as well. Yesterday I learned that there are good ones out there, who really do care about their cities/towns. Cops like the one I mentioned in my story, are the real heroes. But thank you for reading my post!! :)
g0zfll,fndhzdb,,Hello I just want to say that I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs it‚Äôs like to be homeless outside on the street but I do know what‚Äôs it‚Äôs like to live in a car for two months as I had to do so myself.. and I also suffer from depression and ptsd and I know exactly how you feel.. when I was living in my car I would always cry and I just felt so worthless and I always asked myself.. why me? Why couldn‚Äôt I have a family and a home like everyone else I know? And it‚Äôs always gets to me and brings me down every time.. I‚Äôm no longer homeless though but my situation hasn‚Äôt gone any better I‚Äôm in a toxic abuse relationship now üòî where I feel dead and empty inside and trapped and can‚Äôt do anything about it unless I want to live in my car again.. anyway I hope you‚Äôre doing okay
g0zfll,,fndl7vh,Hello! Thank you for opening up to me. I‚Äôm very stoic and robotic in person, but I can express myself whenever I want to, I just choose not to often. You are strong just for sharing your story, remember that. You are the first person I can say, has shared my pain, so that‚Äôs awesome and terrible at the same time. I‚Äôm glad you are no longer sleeping in your car but any form of abuse is never worthy of living through. I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm a very stubborn 20 year old though so my decisions are always gut based no matter how logical someone else‚Äôs opinions may be. Pride is a sick character trait that I‚Äôm still working on but this reply isn‚Äôt about me. Look, when I went through what I went through to cause my depression and PTSD, I felt broken, I felt useless, and insignificant. It sounds like you feel the same way now. I know how it feels to feel empty inside, it‚Äôs NEVER a good feeling; nobody should ever feel this way. So what I say to you is, (and this is just advice so feel free to take it or not :) <- see what I did there? Hahaha. Is too try your best to get out of this relationship you are in the best way possible for your own stability, and focus on your dreams, your goals, your aspirations! You still have life, you can still breath, so why not live doing what makes you happy? I know whenever I contribute to my own dreams, that I feel all the pain and suffering flee my body. All the negativity disappears, and not just slightly but altogether for however long I‚Äôm enacting on my goals. Hopefully soon, when I get back on my feet and better my situation 10x fold, like I know I can, I wish to take a weekend (or week, I wouldn‚Äôt mind hahaha) long vacation in Hawaii! I‚Äôve always admired the Polynesian and Hawaiian culture, and wish to see how beautiful it really is. Eat the amazing looking food, and dance with some pretty pretty Hawaiin natives (tmi I know hahaha) but in conclusion, please get yourself out of the situation is you don‚Äôt see it getting better, which unfortunately rarely happens :( have a goal, dream, and act on your aspirations. And when you doing better than you are now, celebrate your success!! I hope this helped, thank you for reading my post :)
g0zfll,,fnf8bs4,Thanks for being positive still even after everything you‚Äôre going through. It definitely isn‚Äôt easy and you‚Äôre a strong person for it. I plan to start nail tech school on May once everything is opened again .. this corona virus is just slowing everything down but once I can finally start doing stuff again I want to obtain my nail tech license and start my own business :)  I hope everything works out for you though and I truly Hope you‚Äôre situation is much better later on. I‚Äôm here anytime you want to talk I am 22 now things really got bad for me when I was 21 :/ before that I was in college and had my own place but depression is really no joke
g0zfll,fncodxi,,What a nice guy!! I really enjoyed your story.
g0zfll,,fncpt55,Thank you! Writing has always been one of my talents and i really enjoy doing so. Thank you for reading :)
g0zfll,,fnd047z,Why do you not qualify for the stimulus package? That sucks!
g0zfll,,fndaymz,I was already claimed as a dependent :(
g0zfll,,fnde1lt,Wth?  Whoever's claiming you is obv not providing for you, so I think that's illegal for them to do.. not sure if you know that and don't mind, or if you know but feel like you can't do anything about it, but there are options..
g0zfll,,fndel6c,What are my options? My mother has always been money hungry since she and my dad split.
g0zfll,,fndm8d4,You'll need to let the IRS know you are being claimed when she's not supporting you in any way.
g0zfll,,fndp3cw,I just looked it up and falsely claiming someone as a dependent can get you up to 3 years in jail and $250k in fines!
g0zfll,,fndut88,How should I go about this legally? The irs offices and hotline are shut down temporarily.
g0zfll,,fnduwx6,I would email them.
g0zfll,,fndv3oh,Once I get back to the park where I reside throughout the day, I shall do just that! Thank you so much
g0zfll,,fndoub7,Oh hell no! Definitely let them know! You probably won't be able to get anyone on the phone so I would put an email together explaining everything including your current situation. No way should she benefit like that while screwing you over!!! Fight for your money you deserve!
g0zfll,,fneweav,uhh.. you said you've been on the street for a week and in your car for two months, so entirely in 2020.. your stimulus eligibility is based on the last tax return (2018-19) filed by yourself or where you are claimed as a dependent. so if your mom supported >50% of your expenses and you made low income yourself..   ..then you absolutely can be claimed as a dependent. you're getting some disjointed, potentially bad info here. if you were provided for on some level in 2019 then that counts on a 2019 tax filing (which is what everyone is filing now, 2019 taxes). whatever is happening in 2020 *has no effect on* 2019.  just bear that in mind and double check shit you read on reddit, especially when you're just being casually told to turn in your mom.
g0zfll,,fnexnkh,OP had a job and was taking care of himself. Has mom has just been taking advantage of the situation. He did not give her permission to file him as a dependent.
g0zfll,,fnf1a8q,so did he make taxable income in 2019 and file his taxes not claiming himself as a dependent of another? because that's what amounts to permission and intent the irs needs. if he did file as a dependent, he'd be as guilty as his mom, if he did not then his mom will get audited. did you know any what you're saying now prior to your response 8hrs ago?
g0zfll,,fnf1it6,I'm not going to argue with you. The point is that his mother should not have filed him as a dependent in the first place. He is 20 years old. when he filed his taxes recently that's when he found out what had happened. so we are helping him to rectify the situation! End of story.
g0zfll,,fnexgdv,op said "I‚Äôve only been on the streets officially homeless for a week and living in my car for 2 months" so their homelessness as they put it is entirely in 2020. if op was living with/supported by the mom >50% in 2019 and claimed as a dependent then they're ineligible for the stimulus. what happens in 2020 has no effect on 2019.
g0zfll,fnd7c54,,What a lovely story and kind of renews my faith in the police force.  I wanted to suggest to you that you check out the subreddit r/Assistance for those times darker times. Before you can ask for anything you need to meet some requirements which I think is having 300 karma points and registering with the site first before you request anything.  I follow it and the people on it can be really generous.  I wish you all the best.
g0zfll,,fndbbyb,Thank you for the words of encouragement, I greatly appreciate it. And no problem! I‚Äôll definitely check the sun out when I get a chance and try to see if I can join when I can. Thanks again :)
g0zfll,fncogvw,,I hope it's the start of good things to come
g0zfll,,fncpq3j,I hope so as well. My faith in things getting better has been revitalized :)
g0zfll,fnddwek,,Thank you for sharing <3
g0zfll,fnejoh0,,I looked into your post history and saw a post you made when you were 16 about your parents abusing and neglecting you.   I really wish I had an answer, but I am glad someone showed you some kindness. I hope things get better, but sadly the world is really fucked up right now with the virus.
g0zfll,,fnekbzy,Thanks for checking on my previous posts on here and reading my post! I truly appreciate the read, it makes me happy knowing people are reading my post more and more; it‚Äôs kinda unbelievable hahaha. But yes, this virus has made it harder for anyone at the bottom of the barrel to even have a chance to get back up, it truly sucks :/ but I‚Äôm still faithful that all of this crap will end soon, so I can finally progress my life in a productive way. Thank you again for the read :)
g0zfll,fnepejy,,love and peace to you man. This world we live in is harsh and unforgiving. Your homelessness is an inhumane reality of our greedy world and my heart hurts for you and all others who find themselves in that reality. Never give up your fight to be who you want to be and always pay forward in love when and how you can. The only way we can make the world better is by loving on each other like the cop did for you. It warms my heart to see goodness like that. Keep your head up.
g0zfll,,fnesssx,Indeed! This world is getting greedier and greedier. I‚Äôm glad that people like that cop still exist. Thank you for the love and support. Sooner than later, I‚Äôll be able to say that I‚Äôm out of this situation and moving on to bigger and better things. Thank you for reading my post as well :)
g0zfll,fncoexg,,God bless you.
g0zfll,fncq9a0,,I'm very happy for you that some light shined in your direction good luck man I wish you the best
g0zfll,,fncqog5,Thank you! I will work as hard as I need to in order to prevail. I was ready to give up on my life and my future, but now I‚Äôm prepared to fight for it.
g0zfll,fncqq98,,I really, really hope you find a path through to stability. I am glad you met someone caring, I hope he can help connect you with resources you need. Hang on. Wishing you the very best. You, your dreams, and your future matter.
g0zfll,,fncr3aq,Thank you so much!! Tonight I was reminded that I still have a chance, even though it didn‚Äôt seem like I did, I still do. It‚Äôs been a while since someone has shown some real concern for my position, and I don‚Äôt say that because he gave me money. Everything about the conversation and situation was purely genuine. I hope to see this man again later in life, he may not know it, but he acted heroically to me.
g0zfll,,fncrldt,<3  I looked through your post history and you really, really deserve a break. I truly hope things go well for you. You might have a difficult road ahead of you, but with your positivity and good heart I think you can find a way. There are opportunities out there ‚Äî unfortunately not everyone is able to find them or take advantage of them, but you could easily be someone who does. Best wishes, and stay safe.
g0zfll,,fncsbhu,Oh wow! That‚Äôs kinda embarrassing hahaha. It‚Äôs filled with really dark and weird stuff, but thank you for wishing me well. It‚Äôs best I go through something like this now. I know I‚Äôm very young, and talk about starting a family, but I like to think of the past few months as a adventure I could tell as stories for my children. And who knows? Maybe I can turn those stories into children‚Äôs books?! I‚Äôm thinking way too ahead of myself hahaha but thank you again for reading and for the kind words :)
g0zfll,,fncspr2,Having a vision to hold onto for your future is incredibly important ‚Äî it is grounding when things are awful. Without it it‚Äôs hard to know the next step to take. Your life sounds like it‚Äôs had some dark episodes for sure (I understand your desire for a loving family when you haven‚Äôt known that as you should have), but I don‚Äôt see it as embarrassing at all. You are a strong person, and I‚Äôm sure people will benefit from your stories someday.
g0zfll,,fncta37,Wow so much compassion in one day. Everyone on this reddit and the cop has made my seemingly awful day into probably one of the best days of my life. I won‚Äôt let you or anyone else down I promise. And yes, I dwell on the thought of having children of my own all the time. The activities, the birthdays, even the typical family banter haha. I can‚Äôt wait to see the day(s) :)
g0zfll,fnf980w,,How nice....sometimes the nicest people are those you would never expect it from.  There are some nice cops out there....just so sad that the bad ones ruin it for the good ones...cuz the bad ones are so bad.
g0zfll,fngelp7,,Hey man. I know this might not mean much. But I hope the best for you, I've been officially homeless for a bit, and I've been looking for a job (still haven't found one, but that's ok!), and it's kind of hard due to this virus, but I'm sure I'll find one. I've been living in my car for a while, but I am sure I can change that someday.  Your story means a lot to me, and I'm sort of crying because of the situation in, but I know it will get better. And thanks to your post, I know that I can change it. I just need to persevere. If you ever want to talk, you can speak to me! Besides looking for a job, I'm doing a few things here and there :).  Stay safe. I know you can make it!! You can rise above this!! I know you can!! We may not know each other, but you've touched my heart, and I hope for the best for you. Stay safe, man!!
g0zfll,,fnhkvsd,Of course!!! I‚Äôll PM you here in a bit. My situation took a complete 180 although it being due to luck. I understand the pain of being in the streets. It‚Äôs haunting. Keep on job hunting, I know you are going to make it through just like I will make it through. I‚Äôm not done yet, just because I found shelter doesn‚Äôt mean I have any intention of slowing down any bit, so you can‚Äôt either. Best of luck to you brother or sister. I‚Äôm rooting for you always ‚ù§Ô∏è
g0zfll,fnd13y4,,Hi, So glad you were this act of kindness as a turn around. This cop is obviously a good hearted and kind person.   You will win and get through this  I can tell. You go man and keep us updated. You for this. I'm praying for you.
g0zfll,,fndb72y,Yes! The cop really did change my outlook on my situation. Although I‚Äôm sure he felt like didn‚Äôt do much, he did more than he could‚Äôve ever thought. Thank you so much for the kind words!! I‚Äôll keep you all updated on my situation as time goes by. Thank you for keeping me in your prayers. :)
g0zfll,fncy2b4,,Most police officers are good people.   As always, in any group of people there are going to be a few bad apples.  That in itself is unfortunate.   It‚Äôs also unfortunate that these bad apples are usually the ones that get the most media coverage or get splattered all over social media.       Rest assured, most officers want what‚Äôs best for your wellbeing.   They genuinely care about the people they interact with on a daily basis.   They want to help you.    After this most recent interaction I‚Äôm glad you now have a more positive attitude towards the police.   They‚Äôre human beings just like you and me.   Be respectful towards any officer and they‚Äôll most likely respond respectfully in return.    I hope your situation improves and you are able to get off the street.  I wish you the best.
g0zfll,,fnczfv8,I totally agree! The media coverage of officers isn‚Äôt really fair. I‚Äôve seen dozens of videos of bad apples but I‚Äôve only seen about 3 good ones. I can admit that I was one of those people who wanted nothing to do with cops no matter, and as unbiased and open thinking I thought I was, tonight was reminded that you can‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. That man lifted my spirits in just 30 minutes and I‚Äôm grateful for his assistance.
g0zfll,,fnczk8l,I‚Äôm happy to hear that!.   I hope you find a way out of your current situation.   Best of luck to you, bud!!
g0zfll,,fnczsze,Thank you, I will find a way back on my feet, trust me. And I like your username a lot too :)

[https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here)   You need a mailing address or ideally a bank account for direct deposit. I think you can use a pre-paid card too.  I really dont get why people dont take this more seriously. Like you, when I go out I allow for huge space between myself and others, only to have people walk right next me. Are they oblivious, inconsiderate or just plain dumb?  Keep on keeping on, brother.

fzxsx9,,fn9wy1r,welp that didnt work. thank you for the suggestion.  edit . turbo tax let me submit an information efile.
fzxsx9,,fn7bl7s,I had the same issue. It only displayed half the captcha on my phone. I had to switch to a computer to complete the last step. Not everyone has a computer though so I‚Äôm sure this is hindering more people than helping.
fzxsx9,,fn7bynb,yea, thats my issue too. i guess i have to go track down a computer since the library's are closed.   i guess this isn't as bad as the obama care website roll out , but still lol
fzxsx9,,fn7hb6b,So, I filed a tax return with no payment information and I didn't claim anything because I don't have anything to claim... I guess I should have waited a bit, but I'll still get a check, right? It'll go to the address on my ID? It was kind of spotty finding info on all of this when I did this.
fzxsx9,,fn7pf0y,As I understand it, it should go to the address you used on your return. If that was the address on your ID, then yes. I believe they will be posting a "Where's my stimulus?" link like the "Where's my refund?" link they have to track your refund. Keep checking back on the IRS website, its still the best source for info.
fzxsx9,,fn85wzm,Okay. This is all what I figured, just some reassurance is nice.

The fact you have not showered in a month, figure something out today. Much love bruv
fzxsx9,fn7o0hm,,It‚Äôs not fun but if you go buy a couple jugs of water and poke some holes in the top you could have a shower.  That‚Äôs what I had to do today!
fzxsx9,fn6ob6e,,I know it's cold comfort but it has always been like that: sound and fury signifing nothing. The devil is always in the details.   Either learn to take care of yourself or learn to play off of peoples' empathy.
fzxsx9,,fn6v26o,Agreed. These announcements are for the most of the population to be fooled by, most of the time. We sleep better at night knowing the poorer, more disadvantaged are being provided for. Otherwise it would be outrageous, right? So shhh, yes homeless are covered, sheltered, fed and cared for, lol.  When you actually investigate the details (who does that), you find out its all BS.  As a professional, long term, experienced 'outdoors' person, I know this all too well.

fzxsx9,fn81yoh,,They forwarded s*** about my unemployment as well and said call back next week because I'm lost and I can't guarantee that they will do anything they're so backed up yeah that really sounds reassuring.

fxje27,,fmur8b5,I got her in Phoenix AZ while I was homeless. I've been homeless 11 years now. I seen other homeless people keep cats on the streets but cats are alot harder to keep homeless than dogs.
fxje27,,fmurixa,Cats are definitely harder. I live out of my storage unit. I get work here and there but that has just come in the past 2 months. I did the best that I could to pay for their boarding but it wasn't good enough. I had to give up my only real family.
fxje27,,fmus0aw,That sucks. I hope you can find a place so that you can get another cat or 2. Keep your head up and don't stay out here as long as I have. Too many years and your thought process changes then there's no going back.

fwn68c,fmpnhpx,,Ace hardware, Lowe‚Äôs and plumbing supply shops sell a 4 way sill cock water faucet key that will let you open spigots on commercial buildings.   Hopefully you can get some anti bacterial dish wash detergent. It works for shampoo and hand washing.  A plain sponge and a bottle of water works ok for cleaning up as long as you have some privacy.
fwn68c,fmpa7wt,,Yeah, it really pisses me off.  Here in California we have over 108,000 homeless people (like myself).  The governor announced beds in hotels... for 1,000 people.  They tell us to stay home. Don't have one. Don't go to the store. Only place I can shit.  It's infuriating.
fwn68c,,fmqnpxs,>Don't go to the store. Only place I can shit.  Doubly frustrating when that store isn't 24 hours as well. Last place I had to "rough it" was behind a gas station in the middle of nowhere. They closed at 9. God help you if you needed to take a shit after-hours.
fwn68c,,fmrij8l,One can easily shit in the woods or behind a building or dumpster. Source: me...pro homeless pooper üí©
fwn68c,fmpl7xd,,Yea I noticed this. Can't go home if you don't have a home to go to (meme).
fwn68c,fmpqy6s,,It‚Äôs totally true that we are only as safe as our least protected people. I feel so sorry for the masses in LA and NY, they already had health and hygiene issues that were totally being ignored. This will continue to ravage the nation for the next year because we won‚Äôt help the homeless and they will continue to reinfect others out of no fault of their own.  As a sex worker it‚Äôs terrifying to think if I was on the street and a prostitute, because close contact is literally what you are selling. The homeless not only need help, they need ADEQUATE health care and treatment like real citizens- because they FUCKING ARE-so they do not rely on pinching even more funds and sacrificing their safety and the literal safety of the people sitting on the couch!
fwn68c,,fmq8fv7,I think sex workers have worse things to worry about.
fwn68c,fmpfuu8,,It's not true that 20% of the people who get it are hospitalized.  20% of the people who get it, have symptoms, and are in a high risk group are hospitalized.  This is because only those who are in a high risk group and showing symptoms get tested, which is where the 20% figure comes from.  The overwhelming majority of people who get it show very mild or no symptoms.  As we are able to test more and more people, the numbers will more accurately reflect the reality.  Rest assured.
fwn68c,,fmrszu7,Exactly. Also, I want to add that the goal of the quarantine is not to keep everyone in their houses for over a year until the vaccine is made (if it is even made). This would simply destroy the economy and there would be tons of homeless people around by the end of the year.  The quarantine is happening because they want to slow down the spread so that the healthcare system doesn‚Äôt get too overwhelmed at once. There are simply not enough doctors and ventilators for everyone at this moment.  Also, it seems like most people do get immune to the virus after they have got it, for a substantial period of time. So, when people eventually do go out and the second wave hits, the spread will be more manageable because many people will have developed antibodies.
fwn68c,,fms4pwm,I think a lot of people lose sight over the idea that these measures are not to prevent people from getting it, they are to slow down the rate in which people get it so we do not overwhelm hospitals.  When you realize that, it's easier to understand why certain actions as individuals are not as imperative.  Sure, me going to a grocery store is putting me at slight risk, but me cutting down my visits to once a week instead of twice a week is still slowing the spread.  There is starting to be witch-hunts among people who have it and their friends and family.  They are trying to figure out who gave it to them as if it's an STD.  It is ridiculous and will only get worse.
fwn68c,,fmslmop,Quarantine is only for diagnosed sick folks. The probable that didn't get tested are "self isolating".  The rest of the population for the most part is under a stay at home order.
fwn68c,,fmqxec6,[deleted]
fwn68c,,fmr2oid,I question the source for that number.  This virus is way too new and testing has been very limited to know that.  In order to know that number, a sufficient sample size of people without symptoms would have to be tested.  You know who we're definitely not testing en masse?  Random seemingly healthy people.
fwn68c,fmpn8mu,,Where you at
fwn68c,fmq48zy,,As a non homeless person, what should I be doing to help? My parents have been showing symptoms so I haven‚Äôt gone outside for a couple of weeks, but in a few days I‚Äôll be able to leave the house again and I want to help. What should I do?
fwn68c,,fmvwehb,I saw you just got out of the hospital for a non-covid-related problem yourself. The chaos of the volunteer systems right now would perhaps be detrimental to your own health and your health is vital right now. I have volunteered in other national disasters and can tell you there will be time. The first wave of volunteers will eventually become ill or exhausted and need relief. Once you have your feet under you again, there will be plenty of opportunities to help others. And there will be fewer well people to step in.  I hope your parents aren‚Äôt infected and you all feel better soon!
fwn68c,fmq22qm,,I've done what little I can to try to let people know that things are really dire for those who are currently homeless.   I have a serious medical condition and I spent several years homeless. I know a lot of practical stuff about protecting your health with very few resources, etc.   If you are near the ocean, salt water will help kill stuff and is free.  Try to disengage socially in terms of body language. Don't meet people in the eye. Turn away from people instead of towards them. Behave in a generally stand-off-ish manner.  Tea is an astringent. Drinking it can be helpful to dry up excess fluids when your nose is runny or there is fluid in your lungs.  Spices were originally prized for their ability to preserve food before refrigeration was a thing. Now, we think of it as a taste thing, but that wasn't the original purpose.   Spices preserve food by basically being antimicrobial. When in doubt. choose spicier foods over blander foods to help combat infection. (You can also research specific spices to learn more about what they do.)  Try to just not touch stuff and not get dirty to begin with. If you can't get cleaned up, just try to not get dirty.   I know that's hard. I did it for literally years. But it does make a difference.  If you can get a change of clothes, just throw the old clothes out when you change. Treat them like hazardous waste for the duration of the pandemic.
fwn68c,fmrajaf,,I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through this without access to soap and water. You could make a mask with an old t shirt and two rubber bands like the surgeon general demonstrated, which would protect you at least a little bit.

fwn68c,fmr6lxq,,I am not homeless, but I've always been thinking about this subreddit during the whole pandemic, because the homeless are screwed. If you are lucky enough to have at least a car to live in, then it would be better than having to sleep in the public. If you live in a tent, you would be screwed too. In my state NJ, the governor closed all county parks, state parks, forests, and hiking trails, except for municipal parks. I am not sure if the police would be monitoring the woods for people.
fwn68c,,fmyb468,> I am not sure if the police would be monitoring the woods for people.  Thanks to FLIR thermal imaging cameras monitoring "woods" is very easy to do these days...
fwn68c,,fmyb8z2,>I am not homeless, but I've always been thinking about this subreddit during the whole pandemic, because the homeless are screwed.  We need to email all the house representatives and senators a link to this subreddit. Maybe some will read from it on the house/senate floors.

fwn68c,fmpa78j,,It's horrible people don't belong sleeping on streets like animals. Why do we need a coronavirus to show us how bad things had become? People need to be forced into nicer shelters not Holiday Inn but not a horrible place. The shelter's don't have to be in the city either why the hell do you think people move to the suburbs for?  People say they're homeless because housing is too expensive.  Then get out of the overpriced City, and the government should be helping by building places for them to live outside the city where they can have a chance to do better for themselves. Unfortunately too many people prefer the lifestyle I know it doesn't speak for everybody. They can take away people's businesses their lives their dignity their jobs make them stay at home eat shity delivered restaurant food but they can't even make homeless stay in hotels in California. Enough is enough already let's start truly helping those that are trying and I know this is controversial but if you want to just live your life on the streets doing drugs and whatever then you suck and you're only going to cause bigger problems for the rest of us.
fwn68c,fmqy5p2,,I really wish someone will help you.  Even if I wasn't flat broke right now, I don't even know what I could do for you.  I don't get paid until the 10th, and I work 4 days a month, so I don't have a pot to piss in much either.  I really, really hope someone helps you, where are you at????
fwn68c,fmpe6zi,,Hmm. Perhaps we should invote yall to our place o.o As neighbours would do üò∂ F the social norms.... Nvms... Dhxbroffn  ...
fw91sb,fmp1gak,,Pay attention you will see this new phenomenon where younger homeless men are wearing clothing freshly ripped in the seat . They are missing shoes too lately.I say serial rapist because they ALL had same exact cut in their jeans!
fw91sb,fmmyh8l,,Is this satire?
fw91sb,fmnfssb,,San Franpsycho. The only thing keeping that city from sliding into the ocean is a wingnut on every corner holding it down.
fw91sb,fmnsf2o,,What the fuck? Is there someone that has an exact idea as to what‚Äôs going on? Is it really serial rape? I‚Äôm in the area and this is quite concerning....
fw91sb,fmn36jm,,I‚Äôm sad that San Francisco doesn‚Äôt look out for the vulnerable. This society placates peoples excuses with feeble response. If they push the homeless where you can‚Äôt see the problem , it only moved.

fw91sb,fmmypul,,No, Recently was in Japan Town (post st)saw a man pants slashed completely out of sorts and very distressed. There is a trend he was one of five men I‚Äôve seen like this.
fw91sb,,fmqz3x8,Sorry if this question is dumb, but i honestly know nothing about the homeless population. As far as crime among homeless go, is rape normly higher among the homeless than the general population or lower?

fvcta5,fmixg0r,,Whole Foods and Sprouts were always on my list of places to go when I needed a bathroom when I was living on the streets. Usually less competition for bathroom stalls and usually much cleaner as well.  And if you are in an area where there‚Äôs lots of office buildings that are high-rise if you go in and look around you can often find good bathrooms that are nice and clean and quiet and very out of the way.   Although that may be more difficult right at the moment.  Also recommend a glass jar with a lid and finding a funnel that has a super long and thin end.   There is somebody that posted I think in car living that‚Äôs what she was using for a bathroom if in an area where there aren‚Äôt any or you can‚Äôt wait.   Can buy the jars cheap from the thrift stores and get the funnels cheap from Walmart automotive section or a place that sells auto parts.
fvcta5,fmixl9w,, Bro..... I was there yesterday

fvcta5,,fmix496,There's a gas station but it's usually closed or I have to wait for who ever is in the bathroom to get out. Being high homeless traffic here means I could be waiting for a long time.

fti7zz,fm8aii7,,Mannn ikr. But seriously i was told that they heard some chick yelling at a guy by the street and she was saying how she was going to burn that place down.   Theres still fire trucks there. So lame
fti7zz,fm8ekpg,,At least you weren't in bed asleep when it happened friend.  I'm glad you survived to tell the tale.
fti7zz,,fm8qoid,I know right because i wanted to go lay in bed but our friend told we should just do our laundry tonight. We went and got the bag but for some reason (i never ever leave my bike anywhere) i left my bike. So i got a little of pur clothes thank God but im heartbroken over my bike
fti7zz,fm8ks95,,That's awful and I'm super glad you're safe!  (I'm also curious how you found an abandoned hotel and we're able to get inside)
fti7zz,,fm8r8pu,Thanks im still in shock i think.  Mainly sad cause my bike was in there. It was a bad ass fix gear road bike. So sad..  But i personally found this one through word of mouth. I actually just moved here andy friend showed me it. But its easy ive been living in bandos for years. Just be careful goimg in and if you see things that belomg to people domt mess with it. And i always like to explore a new one during the day time.
fti7zz,,fm8rg05,Oh that BLOWS about your bike man! I'm assuming they couldn't salvage it?

fti7zz,fm7uvsd,,Get out of town/county/state ASAP. You will be blamed for Arson and they will send you to jail. The homeless are a favorite fall guy for Arson. Why the fuck did you post this? Are you stupid? Don't you know that Reddit keeps logs of all IP addresses past and present connected to a username? They can identify you. Get outta there and be safe and free.
fti7zz,,fm8g7gt,He will be fine.
fti7zz,,fm8gev6,Uhhhh.
fti7zz,,fm8sl6r,Im a chick and you need to put the pipe down. You are right about homeless people being fall guys but not to this extent. Lol goos lookomg out tho
fti7zz,,fm8xb0i,You're already suspect #1. Do you know what a Stingray is? It's a device that emulates a cell phone tower and makes your phone talk to it before it talks to your carrier. That little reroute feeds all sorts of information to a server. Information they don't need a warrant to get. The moment the pigs begin investigating possible arson they will know you were there and that you spent a lot of time there. Pulling those records is one of the first things they'll do. Do you really want to take the risk? How sure are you that the pigs there aren't biased? Aren't racist? Or worse? And they will investigate, they've got an abundance of time right now. You might be thinking it's no big deal, that property was abandoned. Well now that it has burned down there's either possible insurance money at stake or development opportunities. They will investigate; your ass is hanging in the wind, are you so certain they care to put the work into making sure they find the "right" guy? Remember the California "Camp Fire" fire? I know three guys that went to jail for that one and the "authorities" actually figured out the real perpetrator was PG&E, yet they still got jail time/probation. My advice, GTFO. But hey, it's your ass.
ftqhd6,fmdywaw,,I am sorry but this admin has only designated stimulus checks for ppl who filed a tax return or get SS benefits.  Depending on what state you are in they may issue extra snap benefits.  People with social security wouldn't even be getting anything if it wasn't for the Dems.  Are you eligible or SSI or SSDI?  Maybe that could help you.  I've been homeless before so I understand what you're going through.
ftqhd6,fm8flgc,,You said you didn‚Äôt file your taxes for many years. So I believe you don‚Äôt get anything. It‚Äôs based on your 2018 and 2019 taxes
ftqhd6,,fmdyaoe,Yes, the groups getting this check are ppl that filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and SS beneficiaries.  Veterans are not even eligible.  Sorry.
ftqhd6,,fm8gewm,That's a major flaw and not in harmony with the whole 'looking out for people hurting' purpose of the stimulus/relief
ftqhd6,,fmcspe0,you will get the check if you file a simple tax return which basically includes your ssn number and bank account. keep checking http://irs.gov/coronavirus i do not think they made the portal yet so stay tuned
ftqhd6,,fm8kpvj,I believe that they have remedied because the poorest would be screwed if they hadn‚Äôt.  You will have to file a simple tax return if you haven‚Äôt filed taxes.  I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve released that form yet. But obviously you‚Äôll need a bank account or address to have the $1200 sent to.  Not filing taxes or not having income still don‚Äôt disqualify you from it.
ftqhd6,,fm8kzap,i have an address i can use...so, the simple tax form is something new that is coming from this situation?
ftqhd6,,fm8m83g,I heard from someone who filed without having done 2018 taxes that it can be done entirely online now. If no income, you can put one dollar in the "interest/dividend" income category to make it go through. It seems the program depends on the IRS system and social security numbers for identification of citizens and distribution of the aid. (so illegals are out of luck although most homeless seem to be citizens) gl.
ftqhd6,,fm9dulq,I believe so because of the issue of not paying the poorest of people who have no income and haven‚Äôt filed taxes need the money desperately. Keep checking because as is everything with the government they‚Äôve changed the rules 456 times to do one simple thing.
ftnbfw,fm7wdlx,,Everyone is still going to pay rent, they just want it deferred to a later date, nobody is going to get free rent.
ftnbfw,fm8mvb4,,Seriously, those that are refusing to pay rent period, where the fuck was their outrage two months ago when thousands of their brothers and sisters were sleeping in the street? I say, if they're not paying rent, give the apartment to the homeless, spread that housing around. Let them be homeless for a month and then maybe when things get back to normal, people will have first hand experience knowing how the other half lives and start to give a shit. I love that it takes the risk of being homeless themselves to get people angry and demand change but these are the same folks who looked the other way when people were freezing in the streets this last winter.
ftkso2,fm7ivvk,,Dont   Unless your life is in immediate danger   Things are real bad just now with the pandemic. Suck up  whatever you need to for now as you couldn't be doing this at a worse time.
ftkso2,fmabhqk,,Dont, not now. With the pandemic there are basically no services available. Shit is bad even for the more experienced homeless
ftpt15,fm8ox2b,,Hey don‚Äôt give up hope you have to try. If you download the Booking app you will see that for 28 days the Found Hotel in San Fran has a mixed female dorm room for $658 for April 7 - May 5.

ftpt15,fmab41e,,Hey, I am currently homeless, as I live in my van in the SFBayarea there is a lot of resources out there for a TAY aged youth. there is fredfinch organization and covenant house. They can help you get your benefits just check in with social services. I am in a totally another can of worms as a student during COVID 19. right now as it is I could potentially give 600 a month toward rent which would be ideal but rent is too expensive where I am at in the bay.
fttn12,fm8zom0,,My own experience is that they are incompetent. The  workers who are not volunteers are paid minimum wage. Gaslighting gives them way too much credit.
ftqki7,fm8wahn,,While it's an optimistic view, I've learned people can be terrible. Many people actually don't have the money to move into a rental, from those I've talked to. Usually they are priced out, as the first thing, from anything that's anywhere near resources of any kind. Public transit in US is horrible, so unless you can afford a car, you won't get a cheap apartment near any kind of a job. If you need medical care, that's another far away thing. Any types of additions, or anything that requires going to a medical facility is usually in a weird spot not near transit. Or it's downtown, but your place is not anywhere near that.   Many people I've talked to have a ton of health conditions - kidney disease, diabetes, ulcers, cancers, liver disease, etc. So having a job is not a real possibility. Many people who are housed, even though they will be homeless if they miss like a paycheck, like to look down on the homeless, because there is a weird mentality - well at least it's not me.   Currently a bunch of cities are setting aside hotel rooms to help homeless quarantine if there is a chance they have covid-19 or if they are undergoing testing for it and have symptoms. The ignorance of people is incredible "well why do they get to stay in a hotel? Who is paying for it? etc" So yeah, I don't think it will be good.   Disclaimer - not homeless, started volunteering a while ago doing direct outreach to people and actually talking to people living outside. Learned a few things.
ftqki7,fm8hdko,,Homeless people are at as much or higher risk of catching covid-19 as anyone, so that's equal.   Will this affect the living conditions of homeless people? In the short term, many public places are closed. Gyms, which are usually excellent resources, are all closed. For now, it's bad.  Give it a bit more time, and the trouble with rent and mortgages will play out. Any legislation to improve that will mostly affect renters and homeowners, and during that time homelessness will increase.   Not really sure how far into the future I have to search to find a good outcome for homeless people in general, but I expect it's a long way off.
ftqki7,fm8ob3q,,I was thinking the same thing. Especially now with how people are afraid of their own eviction, they will start to see how the homeless live as it might be in their future. I think this could lead to a more sympathetic and protective system for all those who can't afford housing and basic necessities. Hopefully the government will see this necessity and divert funds from corporate bailouts.
ftqki7,,fm8rxdg,>future. I think this could lead to a more sympathetic and protective system for all those who can't afford housing and basic necessities.  It could so long as such people are not at real risk. But they will squash the homeless like a bug if they see themselves in real danger.
ftqki7,,fm90qqm,Oh no doubt! I think better policies will be enacted that will benefit the homeless that SURVIVE this crisis. Food pantries will be depleted by those without jobs now, with shops like Starbucks being closed, there are less places for the homeless to charge their phones and unless you're super rich, financial donations will drop because people don't know if they'll be fired soon (those still with jobs). Now is the most dangerous time to be homeless, and that's not even accounting for the virus, that's just taking into account the lack of resources.
ftqki7,fm8rl56,,Initially I was optimistic but I have grown more pessimistic. How do we treat refugees? Not well. How do refugees treat each other? Not well.   We will be fine so long as things do not get too bad... if this V shaped recovery actually happens. But worst case is really an ugly case that will be hell for many.
ftqki7,fma6es8,,Its not going to help.  I was homeless before, and dealing with enough challenges.  Unless I get lucky COVID, pretty much seals the deal that I will remain homeless for however long, and further raises the bar on what I would need to earn to get myself out of this.    When this resolves, I will be further set back trying to pick up the pieces where everything shut down.  As is most of the jobs being listed are fast food mc jobs, grocery stores, and warehouses.   I was getting declined from those jobs before. 30% unemployment rate isn't going to help with that.  And all the resources are getting pretty strained.  The food they have been bringing us is stuff the government would probably tell you to throw away (perishable stuff not marked with date or time or allergies, thats most certainly been sitting around too long ) But I've been eating it if it smells ok.  And if I did manage to get a mc job great who is going to rent me a room and let me into an existing household with the stigma that I have been homeless and presumibly in proximity to COVID.
ftqki7,fmbmufr,,I don't see how this helps in the long term.  The government does not have "infinite money". It raises money through debt such as offering bonds (which must be repaid) or taxation. Fewer people are working right now, so the government is getting less payroll taxes. Fewer sales are being made at non-essential businesses, so the government gets less business taxes. Tenants and homeowners alike, stressed out over the uncertain duration and consequences of the pandemic, will likely just save money or just stock up on supplies, so they're spending less money which again means fewer sales (except at grocery stores, pharmacies, and other essential businesses). After this is all "over" the government will have less money for social programs.  A large number of vacancies could lower average rents, but only in the short term. Once this is "over" many people will be competing for all those open spaces, and pretty soon there won't be enough open spaces. Landlords will be able to charge high rents and will be more "selective" on who they accept as tenants. Speaking of which... it's unclear to me what form of rent relief the government is offering. I think they're just offering rent deferral, interest-free, so the tenant still has to pay rent for periods when they weren't working. Landlords don't get to "skip" mortgage payments without consequences. They're just getting to delay mortgage payments, and these might not be interest-free. Landlords that aren't able to collect unpaid rent would have lower income and so pay less tax.
ftqki7,fm8t9by,,Long term yea, disasters tend to reveal the weaknesses in societies (see Katrina)
ftqki7,,fma8o1m,Circumstances in NOLA havent improved unfortunately. Still shit infrastructure, corrupt politicians, very little social services, rampant poverty, and extreme income inequality.   All disasters do is put things in headlines for a little while, then things go back to shit because we dont have a bigger support structure.
ftqki7,fm9d55i,,The only folks that could walk away from this with a leg up from the others are those that will be able to obtain the $1200 check from the government. Not sure how if those that had no income in 2018 will benefit from it, or if they even can, but that's the only thing I can personally think of.
ft7w06,fm61rtz,,I‚Äôm in a NYC shelter right now. They don‚Äôt care about us at all, but I thought they might care about the employees who work here, but they don‚Äôt care about them either apparently. There isn‚Äôt even soap in the bathrooms.

EDIT / UPDATE : Still haven‚Äôt received a DM ... with the info
ft7w06,,fm6ep7l,No soap is pretty bad, but those bathrooms probably couldn't keep a bar in them for very long unless there was a big, big box of soap bars and someone feeding them out to the bathroom slowly.  In these days, that would be money well spent, if not in all days.  Who runs the shelter?

The only restriction being, no smoking, or drinking in the units. As well as jobs training provided to the individuals and families  There is not enough public housing, so I am happy to see this, but what do you mean by "those who are both homeless and unemployed can live in"? Is this free rent? Because I suspect most homeless people could not afford a $600 one-bedroom apartment.

Good point I simply meant you might have a job but the rent price might be to high so if it was capped then they could afford it.  Probably just open it up to all homeless persons.
ft09ny,fm5lv3l,,The way your post and replies are phrased implies you assume all homeless and unemployed people have a drinking problem.      You‚Äôre not taking into account the fact that most homeless people have trauma, and little to no coping mechanisms, so they drink or use other harmful ways to get through the day. Also you're making blanket statements. People who aren't unemployed or homeless can drink and not have a drinking problem. Your perspective shows that you see the unhoused as Other, different and separate from you.      It's demoralizing to meet someone who claims to want to help, but automatically assumes you're some kind of an addict. Especially when you're not.      As for job training what kind of jobs are people training for? Are these jobs the kind where one could actually leave poverty? Or is the work a life that isn't different from being homeless except that one lives indoors? Where is the focus on education? These days one needs a college degree just to attempt to live above the poverty line. This sounds like you're setting people up for failure down the road at a point where their failures aren't your problem anymore, where you can virtue signal to all the voters using everyone as pawns.    The problem of homelessness is complex, and affects people from all walks of life. Your words sound like you're not taking in the full picture, and that you're just throwing simple solutions out hoping they're sound bite worthy.    For perspective try being homeless for an indeterminate amount of time; where you don't know how long you'll be on the streets, without access to any of your funds and only having what assistance you'd qualify for if you weren‚Äôt a politician, where you can‚Äôt call up someone else with the power to bail you out. After you have some relivant life experience and empathy, then I think you could revisit these ideas.   Edit: a typo
ft09ny,,fm7dkh5,>Where is the focus on education? These days one needs a college degree just to attempt to live above the poverty line.  job training *is* education. what's wrong with doing community college for two years for an associate? don't even need a degree to get into skilled trade apprenticeships or it certifications. the average new pt walmart employee earns above the federal and michigan poverty level.
ft09ny,,fm5p1u9,> The way your post and relpies are phrased implies you assume all homeless and unemployed people have a drinking problem.  I am sorry it came across that way, I think it got sidetracked after the rule of no drinking in the housing units was brought up.

This sounds like you're setting people up for failure down the road at a point where their failures aren't your problem anymore, where you can virtue signal to all the voters using everyone as pawns.  I plan (Have this in my platform already) on giving everyone who's parent make under 100K a year to go to community college or trade school free. That would apply to homeless people as well. So no they would not just be put on a path to fail at a later time while I tell the voters "Look everyone is in a home and employed."  I want to and plan to set them up for life long success.  > The problem of homelessness is complex, and affects people from all walks of life. Your words sound like you're not taking in the full picture, and that you're just throwing simple solutions out hoping they're sound bite worthy.  Again I apologize for how it came across. I didn't expect the small rule on alcohol to turn into this big back and forth. I'm sorry it sounded like a generalisation.  > For perspective try being homeless for an indeterminate amount of time; where you don't know how long you'll be on the streets, without access to any of your funds and only having what assistance you'd qualify for if you weren‚Äôt a politician, where you can‚Äôt call up someone else with the power to bail you out. After you have some relivant life experience and empathy, then I think you could revisit these ideas.  My experience of living on the minimum wage is what made me want to run and try to help those most affected. This is my first time running and I am sorry I sounded like I was looking down on the homeless community.
ft09ny,,fm60b3m,Thank you for the apology, and acknowledgement; it sounds like you're motivation is coming from a good place, however I still have some criticisims. ¬†  I drink maybe one or twice a year but your take on alchohol was offensive because people can drink and not be an alcoholic. You're excluding those do drink occasionally or socially but don't have a problem. While it's nice that you're trying to help those with a problem, those who don't have said problem are being punished as well.   ¬†  It seems like you want to help sub groups of homeless. Nevertheless your focus is on the groups that typically get the most help. In my area if you're not a teen, a parent, or someone with addiction there is no help. Only waiting lists, with years to decades of waiting. I understand the need to help parents on the street, the street is somewhere no child should be, but it still happens. I also understand that the general consensus is to focus on children before other groups like mental illness or victims of abuse. However, parents are one of the groups with the most focus, as are alcoholics. People who don't fit in those two boxes are left with just trying to survive. Once again exclusion is the problem.¬†  ¬†  You‚Äôre still forgetting people. You can‚Äôt solve homelessness if you don't consider everyone. Or if you focus on the people who have the most help already.¬†   This is not an easy subject. Thank you for your time, efforts, and consideration. Once we are helping the most vunerable, only then, can we all work together to fight this problem.
ft09ny,,fm64p72,>  I drink maybe one or twice a year but your take on alchohol was offensive because people can drink and not be an alcoholic.

While it's nice that you're trying to help those with a problem, those who don't have said problem are being punished as well.  Wow I didn't even think about occasional or social drinking. You are completely right my policy of prohibition was an attempt to shut out a problem without taking into consideration the innocent ones it would affect. I will make sure the policy is only against excessive drinking.  >  It seems like you want to help sub groups of homeless. Nevertheless your focus is on the groups that typically get the most help. In my area if you're not a teen, a parent, or someone with addiction there is no help. Only waiting lists, with years to decades of waiting.  Obviously yes I wanted to help parents and children, my main goal is actually to take those who are ready and willing without drug problems or and get them in housing and jobs training and or education.  >  I also understand that the general consensus is to focus on children before other groups like mental illness or victims of abuse. However, parents are one of the groups with the most focus, as are alcoholics.  The thread of comments was advocated for those who do suffer from drug issues or have serious criminal history to be given help with this proposal. I think they took issue with the Alcohol ban as well but for the other reason.  > People who don't fit in those two boxes are left with just trying to survive. Once again exclusion is the problem.    You‚Äôre still forgetting people. You can‚Äôt solve homelessness if you don't consider everyone. Or if you focus on the people who have the most help already.   Rest assured the group of people you would have fit into will be the primary focus of this legislation should I be elected. The same for a national bill if I ever got into the federal government.  Once again thank you for pointing out the flaws in my proposal. Everything you have said will be taken into account.
ft09ny,fm8u34y,,Hey OP, will you advocate for ending the drug war and legalizing at least cocaine? It's harder for people to be homeless meth heads of the drugs are legal and toy know easy to access so they don't have to spend all this money on tbe drugs.

ftc4y1,fm6utp0,,The rules of this sub say to be helpful and respectful, and no judging. My hands are tied, so all I'll say is best of luck improving your situation.
fse197,fm1xx0j,,Raleigh huh? I'm in NC too. Tons of forest in this state. Try and get to a sizable wooded area that's still near some stores and set up a camp well back in the woods. If you can't afford a tent, tarps and line are cheap and you can fashion a rain shelter out of them. Newspapers will make a reasonably warm bed if you can't get a sleeping bag. Bury your feces a decent ways away. In a pinch, dry leaves or more newspaper will serve as toilet paper. Try to have a couple of gallons of water, for drinking and sponge baths. An outdoor spigot at any of these closed buildings can be used to refill your water jugs. Also look for outside power outlets. They are often found in picnic shelters and public parks, public buildings and behind vending machines. You can charge your phone there. If you haven't, apply for food stamps. (Link below). If you invest in a can opener and buy non perishables, you can survive on cold canned goods indefinitely. Not glamorous I know, but it's better than starving! Personally speaking, baked beans are cheap, and not bad cold, canned chicken and tuna, armor treet(cheaper than spam) and any veggies you like. Some people I know do chef-boy-ardee cold, but I think it's Awful that way, lol! Have to make that call yerself. Pick up a sub in the deli section every so often for variety, and the mayo and mustard packs can also be used to spice up the tuna and chicken. The point is, this way you can stay at your camp for several days, if you need to avoid going out. Chin up my friend! Our ancestors thrived in much worse conditions. You can too!
fse197,,fm2zpd6,This is what I've been doing up in Canada. I'm up in a city so there ain't much forest and it's also flipping cold so I havent been washing much. I do have a tent now and recently had a friend let me move into his backyard. Now I can get food and warm water left out for me (I need to pick up methadone daily so I don't want to risk his family to any exposure to covid). It's tough and as OP said, the toughest part is taking a shit. I've gotten used to squatting and picking it up with plastic bags...  I've talked to friends that are still city living and I know it's tough. No people out so panhandlers are broke. No fast food. Police blocking homeless people from accessing grocery stores so they're relying on churches.  Drive thrus are still open at many places but they legit will NOT serve you without a car. It makes no sense. You can normally give money to people lined up with their cars but nobody wants to interact with "a dirty bum who probably has that corona disease".  This won't go away any time soon so bunker down and try to find a long term solution that will at least keep you alive.  Good luck man :/

fqsk18,,fltpwps,>You talk like you are part of a world that cares. No one really cares anymore. It's over. Everything I worked for is going to be gone soon and all I can do is watch it go  This is the attitude that keeps people from ever getting out of it. Does the world care? Maybe, maybe not, but you gotta start by caring about yourself. Take it from me, I've felt the same pain you felt at one point in time. The apartment I had in Philly, my car, money I had, I've seen it all go away. But as painful as it all is you have to shake back. You have to keep fighting. And in your situation you have four months ahead of time to figure out what you're gonna do to get out of this mess so you don't have to stay in it for long. The rest of us had maybe a month tops. First time I went homeless I had two weeks time to figure shit out, the second time? Five days. Or was it four? I forget....anyway, you have *some* time to sit and pity yourself, but after that, get to planning.   Take the advice given. Understand that this shit can happen and does happen to anyone. From teachers, to military vets, to security guards, to nurses, CNAs and hospital staff (me), to carpenters (did that on the side too), basically the only occupation I never met while homeless was cops. And it's happening to you now. But you know over the next season from now what it's hittin for. You gotta do what you gotta do.  That r/almosthomeless sub will help you out more than wallowing in self pity and crying will. Face it, it's happening, you gotta deal with it. Sorry. And it's a terrible, hard life and some people die out here. Watched a man die and several get hospitalized including my own wife.

A LOT of people are in a position right now of losing their homes, because of job loss from COVID-19, not from non-payment of taxes.   So, you can take advice and use the next 4 months to turn this around and try to land on your feet, or you can keep posting here and keep getting offended when people try to help you.

fo1mwg,flcww6h,,I've read that it's the people who are severely mentally ill and don't seem alert who have the most trouble raising money in the street because they alienate people too much. On the other hand, a more functional homeless person might just need a little help to get back on their feet.
fo1mwg,flcv2ks,,Cell phone, clean clothes, and necessities are great ideas. I don't know anything regarding drug rehabs personally. To the right person, a car can be the greatest blessing since it is a game changer in providing someone with their own personal space to just hang out, store their belongings close, and sleep. I have also met many homeless people who I wouldn't trust with a car. If you have the time to stick around with the person, then perhaps save the car for last as you get to know them. You could save it as a present for completing rehab or successfully getting hired.
fo1mwg,,fld864c,That‚Äôs a good idea, maybe give the car when they get employed.
fo1mwg,,flii6bt,I agree car is better for when they're employed since you have insurance, gas, maintenance etc. Some people don't have licenses so you'll need that as well.
fo1mwg,fldjtcn,,Secure housing, buy out a cheap lease for a year. Stability needs to come first, the rest will follow.   That's just my experience.
fo1mwg,flcx9uy,,Unfortunately 3K isn't a life changer in and of itself. I would reach out to local agencies and try to find someone already involved in a housing or employment/training/school program, someone who has demonstrated a genuine desire to better their circumstance. Depending on where you are, there are public agencies as well as many smaller non-profits that work w/ homeless individuals in a variety of ways.   The non-profits have much more flexibility in how they work w/ clients and may have volunteer opportunities where you could get to know the clients and their respective needs. This would be your best bet. In fact, your time is worth oodles more than your money when it comes to serving persons in need, but, hey, 3 grand can do a lot of good if used wisely. It can also disappear like a fart in the wind if you rush into this endeavor, so, invest your time first. Good luck
fo1mwg,flhywdf,,Make sure you truly get to know the person you are thinking of trying to help before bringing them into or near your home, especially if they are a drug user. Maybe wait until completion of a drug program before you bring them around your home. And as for the program itself, it does NOT cost $1200 a day, I personally know from experience that it costs roughly $1200 for a 90 day program. It just depends on the program itself, as different programs very in prices. I went to a life changing 90 day intensive inpatient program that was covered by Medi-cal and I didn't have to pay 1 dollar out of pocket. (Medi-cal paid the entire $1200 needed to pay for my bed). So maybe consider looking into some type of health coverage if they aren't covered already? Or if you're not wanting to spend that much many programs have the option of just staying long enough to detox off of whatever drugs the person is using so about usually anywhere from 3 to 14 days, and afterwards when they are released from the detox you can take them to NA meetings get them a sponsor, have them work on their steps, ect.. It's really just a matter of how much you want to be involved, really. But I honestly think that it's a great thing you're wanting to do, just make sure you pick the right person to help. I wish there were more people like you out there, you could really change someone's entire life, I would do anything for an opportunity like this. God bless you üòá
fo1mwg,,fliifer,I'm assuming they mean Vancouver Canada in which case they have medical coverage even if homeless.
fo1mwg,fldzjvq,,I would highly recommend against you personally taking on one single someone as a project because the risk to you and to the person you‚Äôre trying to help is way too great. Find an established charity or group in your area that‚Äôs already serving the homeless and partner with them. Volunteer for a few months, then decide what charity could best use your $3k and donate to them. You sound very well-intentioned with a good heart but you need experience and information before you act.
fo1mwg,flii2n8,,First and foremost: do they want help? I know your intentions are good but some won't accept it.   Ultimately #1 should be cheap housing with a reoccurring way of how to keep rent paid. I would go with a cheap room and use the budget on rent mostly. That's just me though. I know how expensive the Fraser valley is.   I like the idea of helping ONE person who REALLY needs it. Like one person who was just dealt a really shitty hand of cards but you know they'll improve their life given a chance.   Bless you for doing this though for real.
fo1mwg,fliicqi,,Maybe instead of rehab they can try detox and then a sober living house. In Canada detox is free and generally so is the sober living (maybe low cost not free idk) it's covered under health care. I didn't pay anything for detox and could of went on to other programs. Sober living is a good way to pay cheap housing while being sober

fnc444,,flbjip7,The church is literally putting people in danger, including the ones they are "helping".

fnc444,,flc1k5w,You are using their facilities and stabbing them in the back.   If you feel so strongly - you shouldn‚Äôt be using them or you could be grateful for the shelter provided   Just seems hypocritical
fnc444,,flc9bvy,Why does it seem that people think that homeless need to be punished first? Like if you're going to claim you're a shelter, be a shelter. Don't endanger a whole bunch of people. It's like saying - hey don't like being discriminated here - just leave. That's such a bizarre attitude. Leave and go where? Why should the person asking for literally bare minimum - don't get everyone ill with a very nasty, uncurable virus - such an unreasonable request? The church gets a shit ton of writeoffs, at the very least they can try to keep people safe. There are a bunch of churches still having services in person because... something something Jesus. They will literally put all of us in danger.
fnc444,,flclesy,I am no fan of churches - believe me. I feel they should be taxed and that many are delusional social clubs for hypocrites  But to take charity and then demean and make fun of and hope the worst for someone that has actually given shelter to you? Provided hot showers and a safe place to sleep. Maybe even food. You are a rude guest. To take advantage of someone‚Äôs hospitality and spit in their face? There‚Äôs no excuse for that and may that attitude may be a reason for their homelessness.   It wasn‚Äôt a reason for mine. When I was displaced I appreciated every kindness. I met some truly horrendous homeless people in addition to appreciated people that were going through hard times with no safety net.

fnc444,flbjc5v,,In Ohio there are a few churches that are staying open... Many will do nothing to help anyone, but will insist their people show up to pray. Many won't help unless you pray. If he's putting his congregation in danger, he's putting a whole bunch of people in danger.
fm8gt0,i3zdmjv,,How'd it go
fm69ol,fl2mh59,,Where are you ?
fm69ol,,fl388k5,West Virginia.
fm2qe9,fl2a9fl,,Stop panicking, this Corona thing is changing by the hour. Everything will be updated so quit hanging on to the letter date .
fm2qe9,,fl2and7,Imagine living in a car with 2 kids and you only have food stamps to keep them fed. If I didn't freak out about this what kind of father would I be
fm2qe9,,fl2aqeq,It is ok to worry. But I am telling you it will be fine.
fm2qe9,,fl2az1o,And you think a stranger telling me it's okay means more than a letter from my state?
fm2qe9,fl3jnte,,Keep in mind that a lot of the agencies send people letters en mass and sometimes things happen in between when you get your letter or paperwork and when you go to apply or reapply.    And also you should realize that sometimes when they do a lot of these letters it‚Äôs because of a computer glitch or some other kind of really stupid issue.   So until you physically go to the office and talk to a person, take any letter or paperwork or anything that you get with a grain of salt. Especially right now.  I understand it‚Äôs absolutely terrifying but for the moment you just need to take a breath.   If your local office is open on Monday then go down personally if you are able, with your letter and paperwork  and explain your situation and see if they can help you.  Since you have children you might actually be eligible for more programs as far as food goes.  It also might be good to see if they can give you a list of food banks or churches with meal programs or any of that kind of thing. The more resources you have the better.   However be aware that there are a number of food banks and different programs that are closing down for a number of reasons.
fm2qe9,,fl3k0ff,Yeah I'm going to contact them Monday if I can. I can't sign up for more programs unless I do it here where I can physically go to the office. And churches here turned us away before people were losing their minds I'm not going to waste my gas begging them again.
fm2qe9,,fl3kgyx,Churches are doing the same in my area as are a great many of the food banks. Hope you‚Äôre able to get extra benefits.   Tell whoever you talk to you when you‚Äôre doing the info for the food stamps that you went to whatever churches and were turned away. And that you‚Äôre actively looking for other ways and means and all that sort of thing.  You think since you‚Äôve got kids that you would qualify to be put in an emergency shelter or hotel or something.   I guess worst case scenario you could always dumpster dive for food.  Sometimes restaurants will give out food at the end of the day to those that need it instead of throwing it away. So you may want to ask around to different restaurants.   But that‚Äôs assuming that they‚Äôre still open. Might be worth a shot though.  Pretty much been my discovery when I was homeless and even  now that the agencies who are supposed to be helping the most vulnerable are not only not helping but making it worse.  And I know there‚Äôs tons of grocery stores in my area that are desperately trying to hire people for stocking shelves and pulling orders. If you‚Äôre able it might be worth checking into.
flh7v8,fkzlulk,,It's awesome that the hotels are doing this. I just hope they're prepared for the cleanup. It's not uncommon for shelters to be infested with bed bugs & roaches.
flh7v8,,fkztsbb,Yeah...cleanup will not be fun. But good on them regardless. I wonder which cities they‚Äôll be doing this in.   Hopefully Washington follows suit.
flh7v8,fkylrku,,When? After most of us are dead?
flh7v8,,fkyxmrr,Around the time you‚Äôll get the 1000 check and disappear without a trace and wake up staring in hostile 24
flh7v8,,fl3jftw,Actually most homeless are not getting any money since they have not filed taxes recently. And if you made less than 39k it's only $600. And if gov is already garnishing your not axes for student loans you get nothing
flh7v8,fl0z7q3,,I'm not sure how well this will work out.  Part of the reason homeless shelters are so awful is the unfortunate reality that for every decent homeless guy out there, there's a toxic individual who will simply take advantage of others. Even if you're willing to give people a pass on their behavior due to mental illness or drug addiction, the fact is that they're probably not people you want to share a space with.  Giving every homeless person their own room ameliorates many of the most common issues. But if you simply sweep up the street homeless and put them up in hotels, you're still going to find a lot of toxic, unpleasant behavior concentrated in the same place. Sure, stepping in excrement as you walk down the hall isn't as bad as having all your stuff stolen. But it's still bad.  Most of the rest of the problems with shelters derives from the involvement of social workers and other 'homeless advocates'. The sad reality is that such people don't work for the betterment of the homeless - they work for the people paying the bills. Even if they wanted to help, they normally can't because their salaries and grant money comes attached to often counter-productive schemes that are more about keeping the homeless out-of-sight than actually solving homelessness.  The only way I really see this working is if they remove the 'homeless' tag from it. Just inform hotels/motels that the state will reimburse them for lodging in their empty rooms (presumably at a lower rate). If Warren Buffett shows up at the local Motel 6, they'll give him a room just like they would the most down-and-out homeless guy. Let the hotels/motels decide for themselves what constitutes acceptable behavior.
flh7v8,fl0i8lr,,This is never going to happen for those of us in Republican-run states like here in NC. We are fucked.
flh7v8,fkz96v7,,Do it. People who don‚Äôt like it could duck themselves since it better to abate the virus spread by confining people in closed areas instead of being in the public.

fl7ena,fkxi3iy,,See if there is a local FB group and post on it pleading for anyone with a vacant home to allow you to shelter in place there with your family? Perhaps offer to trade your time and any skills you have into working on the home/property or just promising to be a good steward of their property.  Then you‚Äôd be able to hit the food bank and hopefully others who see the post may offer donations of food, towels, etc.  These are unprecedented times and unprecedented measures are being taken everywhere, including acts of kindness.

fl7ena,,fkxgkqr,I wouldn‚Äôt call going to a hospital a death sentence. If your child has symptoms they may already have the illness, and the large majority will recover, but may require hospitalization and fighting off any disease will be harder without shelter or consistent food/fluids. And if they have it you almost certainly do too by being together,
fl7ena,,fkxltg9,>>Going to a hospital is a death sentence.   No, it isn‚Äôt.
fl7ena,,fkxsrlv,Yeah I'm going now I was being ignorant sorry.
fl7ena,,fkxp4yi,Hospitals are not death sentences. Please take your child to be seen by a doctor. Even if not corona, whatever illness the child has can make them more likely to contract corona.   You may also want to contact 211 to see if there is any chance to get into a family shelter. They're not ideal, but better than having your children on the streets during times like this.   Best wishes to you.
fl7ena,,fkxsp29,I'm heading there now. I was ignorant with that sorry.
fl7ena,,fkxt6mc,Glad to hear. I understand your fears. I had two appointments at the hospital here in the last week, and was scared myself. It's easy to let all that's related to the pandemic get to you, along with everything else you're managing. I can only imagine doing all this with children. I hope things get better soon.
fl7ena,,fky3p7i,In Canada they are barring homeless people from the hospital. I got in line 2 hours before the testing center opened 5 days in a row but they were giving seniors priority and there is no shortage of seniors around here. Apparently, they only have 120 testing kits to use per day at this facility. When one of the security guards let that slip, there was chaos.  I have built up over $1000 in tickets in the last 7 days for being somewhere other than shelter. $200 for sitting down on one of the benches in the mall. $150 for laying down on a bench in a public park. I've barely slept because the shelters, dining areas of fast food places, community centres, libraries, public parks, everything.... It's all closed and somebody is telling the police force to patrol these areas and ticket the homeless for existing.  I have shown symptoms for the last week but can't be treated at the hospital because they won't let me in. I don't know what to do but I feel your pain from all the way up here.
fl7ena,,fky4nzx,I'm so sorry. I'm at the hospital now with my kids. Other people have been here I heard from 5am and still haven't heard from a doctor. I have to do this for my family so we'll probably be here for the long haul. Both my kids haven't been able to eat for over 24 hours. Personally I know I'm not sick yet but I feel like I could black out at any moment. There's a lot of people here so I'm taking some time to ask strangers to spare something for us. So far everyone else can't help but I have to keep hope so long as I have life in me. Please try to rest as much as possible and drink clean water. We're going to get through this and be okay. Keep telling yourself that.

I admitted to living in a car and being desperate. I was supposed to move into a 2 bedroom house in June, but that guy (potential roommate) now says...due to current hard times, he is selling that house.

And while we're on the subject, since you say that's bigotry and it's wrong..  Since I was once wronged by a police officer (and have read of many similar treatments), am I bigot for not trusting police officers at all now?  And if so, is that bigotry wrong?  Just as people have unpleasant encounters with police, and thus remember police badly in the future, people have had unpleasant encounters with homeless people, and will remember that group in the future.

Putting aside the talk of human rights for a moment, can you answer these questions?  Police have wronged me in the past, and have wronged others. I now avoid all contact with them. If one was on fire, I wouldn't even pee on them. Is that wrong?  If not, then...  Replace the police group with homeless people as a group. If they have ever wronged me, is it similarly wrong with me just to never engage with them at all?

Wait a little while, problem solved. Or is ti? What happens when starving people set upon local neighborhoods and steal or otherwise rob people and  places for survival?

Unlike in other natural disasters, our infrastructure is still intact in this case. The housed will have even less sympathy as a result. This is not where you want to go.   FEMA and local governments do need to figure this out. This crisis is unfolding in real time and they can't cover all bases at once.

fkrdg3,,fkuoggb,And they will be receiving emergency unemployment funds. But yes, in a month things will certainly get interesting.

Wash them, use them, throw them in a sealable lined container and empty into trash.  Wait, what am I saying? This is the homeless forum everyone here knows how to crap outdoors, lol.
fkrdg3,,fkv8x27,Well they could always give them a tainted vaccine if they wanted to get rid of the homeless because they don't buy their new 5g phones and work programming jobs, ect. But that's of course a more sinister and conspiratorial view of course
fkrdg3,,fkvzs9c,I just had an evil thought. ( I get those )  What if the testing stations are really inoculating everyone with the virus?  How would we know?  Now I'm adding **.o2, (IMO) and BIG /S**  so everyone knows this was just a transit thought.
fkrdg3,,fkw3yv4,Still possible. Canadian government innoculatd aboriginal children , I could see evil governments doing it to depop the world, who knows

fkrdg3,,fkussl7,suck my dick you fuckin prat  your kind is going down
fkrdg3,,fkuvklq,Yeah, this is exactly why people vote against doing more for the homeless. I really do fear people are going to be even more hostile to the homeless after we move past this epidemic.
fkrdg3,,fkvmn4v,If you're going to be hostile towards us.  We're going to be hostile towards you.  Not all of us are chumps.  We will go Full Fuckin Negan on society.
fkrdg3,,fkw70ki,This is not the solution for the homeless. We are American. Break into our houses, steal our stuff, hurt our families and we will shoot you. We have guns in America remember? Physical violence needed? We have Marine husbands, Green Beret brothers, Airforce soninlaws, police wives, blackbelt sisters, gun toting grandmas.   Don't threaten force. There are still more of us than there are of you and we are better nourished, more mobile and better armed.   Threats are not the solution. I want to help, but I won't be bullied or forced into it. I sure as heck wont sit still and become your victim.

fkrdg3,fkuh9vm,,This is fucking ridiculous. I keep hearing about  help for everyone - unemployment benefits, relief funds being set up, tax breaks, rebates, bailouts, all this shit for everyone and all I am asking for is a damn place to shower. Holy shit.
fkrdg3,,fkuj48f,As a person who just got in a home trust me we aren't all being helped and I'm about to lose it. Trust me any relief program involving shelter would just spread the virus. Opening the hotels or shelters now would just be large gathering of people who can be infected. I know it sucks but everyone has to hide out. Abandoned buildings, the woods, something. When I lose my house I'm taking my van outa here.
fkrdg3,fkujuza,,Sorry, I would never support forcing hotels to serve the homeless. They're already going to be hard hit (some will face bankruptcy) by the lack of paying patrons, much less people who can't pay but still consume resources.   Unless the government is going to reimburse these hotels for extensive deep cleaning (greater incidence of bedbugs and such), increased security (many homeless in my city also suffer from mental illness), and damages (since hotels can't charge homeless and expect to be paid) I don't think this is fair.     I do think you need a place to go though. Much like in other natural disasters, FEMA needs to step in.
fkrdg3,,fkupmda,FEMA can pay for hotel rooms more quickly than they can set up a fucking camp.
fkrdg3,,fkuqh8m,Doubt it honestly. Gov't negotiations with private entities will take forever unless Trump creates an executive order.
fkrdg3,,fkut0ez,eminent domain.
fkrdg3,,fkuu9kp,That is assuming the county or state wants to shoulder the cost vs. getting federal assistance in the form of tents or converting buildings that are already government owned (i.e. closed schools).
fkrdg3,,fkul5bo,And when all of this is over, where do people in hotels go?
fkrdg3,fkuds9f,,It‚Äôs called martial law...lite  Yes - they can  If you‚Äôre out in the street or in your car- nothing has changed except the alternate places to hang out in the day are closed and if you have a job- the gym may not be open to shower up in anymore- perhaps a coworker can help?
fkrdg3,fkwagvf,,Homeless people exempt from those orders so relax
fkrdg3,fkwtb0o,,Except the private hotels, i guess :/
fkrdg3,fl51en4,,London is doing this, I just read that they are providing hotel rooms for over 300 homeless so that they can self isolate. I know that is a small number, but it's a start, hopefully other cities will follow suit.  I just hope it isn't ruined by some selfish assholes. I just read that a homeless shelter in my town had their bathrooms destroyed, people taking toilet paper and hand sanitizer. Someone broke all the soap dispensers, and when they put out normal soap bottles instead, those were all stolen as well. Really sucks because that hurts a lot of people in the end. I don't mean to stereotype or anything, but I could see some jerks wrecking hotel rooms or stealing things. I just hope that the people who deserve and need help get it, because a lot of homeless are at high risk for this, and I don't want to see people get really sick or die, just because they're already in a bad situation.
fkrdg3,fn1tjhr,,Fuck you  How fucking DARE YOU you ENTITLED PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT  You 100% deserve a painful death from corona or by freezing to death you ungrateful little bum  We're giving you food, water, treating you well instead of i dont know ROUNDING YOU UP AND PUTTING YOU IN CAMPS  Just take a gun and kill them all fucking die every single one
fkrdg3,ibco190,,They are doing this is different places
fkwq6k,fkw2qfe,,Hehe. It's true though.  It fills their bellies, but doesn't provide the nutrients they need.
fkvard,fkwzj5z,,We don't matter.
fkfu3y,fktwwh4,,What I need more than anything else is to take a shower at a place that is NOT A HOMELESS SHELTER.  Telling homeless people to huddle together will just kill us all.
fkfu3y,,fkusbes,there's a list of free showers available across the US posted on the r/brightertomorrow sub. Hopefully there is one near you. Mostly truck stops i think.
fkfu3y,fku2z9z,,Occupy the Money: this is where a stamp is put on dollar bills that would be there to designate that it be donated to a homeless person in need. The stamp would be symbolic and large enough to easily see amongst other bills. This is a suggestion, a reminder to the general population that we are suffering too. It could be a meme to spread awareness in dire times. It‚Äôs illegal but most good things come this way in crisis.
fkfu3y,fktpg2r,,Hey the list of suggestions doesnt work. Can you repost the link please?
fkfu3y,,fkuscwp,thanks for noticing that. i've updated it.
fkfu3y,fkv8g9o,,Note 2: Did you find somebody already? If not, I can have a look at it. Just PM me.
fkfu3y,,fkx5lfv,That would be very greatly appreciated. Whats happening now is that it is loading the branch and updating live. If i change the correct branch it changes the site. Yet it looks nothing like our other live site: publichappinessmovement.com, and there are elements from an old branch still visible. I think it is loading one branch, and then loading another on top of the 1st.   There are two ways it could be fixed, depending how much of your time you are kindly willing to offer.  [the quickest way](http://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/1825/) would be just to wipe the settings and set it up again to auto-compile.  [the other way would make it far easier](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/1496) for developers to contribute to the project and so the code would improve its ability to help the worlds most at need much faster than it currently can.   [Here's the bones of the build process in our documentation](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/1116). It is lacking in detail i'm afraid. [This one](https://publichappinessmovement.com/t/topic/1117) has a little more detail.  If it was more a general 'i'd love to join the build' then say hi in the Introductions thread on one of the skills in our web developers category here

fkcd77,fkrxtgx,,Wait, what city? I'm a reporter for VICE News. My email is [emma.ockerman@vice.com](mailto:emma.ocekrman@vice.com)
fkcd77,,fkrz9c3,Food banks are shutting down all over the US as well. I used to volunteer at one and have been getting emails about it. A lot of people had jobs until this situation occurred and may not be eligible for temporary food stamps for several weeks. With the food banks not operating there is no way for them to acquire food. It's a terrible situation.
fkcd77,,fks1jow,They're shutting down here in Long Beach, CA, USA. Surreptitious 'food bank' spots are dry as well, nobody leaving any leftovers.
fkcd77,,fks1uom,The one that I used to volunteer at basically said that they didn't want to risk the volunteers and staff getting sick. It's hard to believe that they couldn't have bagged up some food and put it outside somehow. If take-out chinese food can still happen then you'd think that there would be a way to do a take-out food pantry somehow.
fkcd77,,fkteebl,[deleted]
fkcd77,,fktji3k,That's good to know. I thought that they looked at your income from the last few months though which would hurt people that just recently lost their jobs or are off of work because of this.

fkcd77,,fks3iej,Things are literally under quarantine right now, I think she‚Äôs alright to do research online.
fkcd77,,fks52gd,This isnt the first time this person has commented or made their own post. Never reaching out or trying to relate. Its cold. This person puts it on the poster or anyone who reads their post to contact them.   Just ask your questions here. Open up and be a real person to us. Go and see what its like to live homeless and then come here with relevant, poignant and helpful questions.  We just have to spill our tragedies and hardships so they can scoop up a story? NO.  Make this worth it. Make real effort for our causes. Help the homeless, dont exploit them.  Edit: and Vice? Vice?! Wtf cares about Vice. No one is reporting on Vice. No one is standing up for causes and makeing a difference on Vice. If im gunna spill my story or explain my whereabouts and whats going on in them i want help, not a flock of seagulls swooping in for the meal.
fkcd77,,fksjlwu,I was in Santa Clara in encampments last week. I've traveled for several homeless stories. I've also reported where I'm based, in NYC, and posted in this forum seeking input. I'm not trying to do anything to upset you, and I'm sorry.
fkcd77,,fksk0yf,I apologize for jumping to conclusions before even asking questions to clear up what i assumed.  I am in a unique homeless situation and am very used to people trying to use my face/story and then leaving me in the dust.  Thanks for what you do and are trying to do.
fkcd77,,fksm8nd,I'm sorry people have treated you that way, and I really hope you're staying safe amid all of this madness.
fkcd77,,fktelgy,[deleted]
fkcd77,,fku6yrg,Im so sorry that was your experience too.  I am so apprehensive of people who havent walked in my shoes and offer help. In my experience it doesnt come without furthur humiliation/embarrassment or owing them something personal.  I hope times have gotten better for you and/or there are happy things on the horizon for you.
fkcd77,,fksgfns,There's a lot of pressure on displaced victims of crimes to remain silent. It's called Omerta and they aren't the mob, it's a nationwide human trafficking ring. They maintain that it's the fault of the victim, that tax funded (by way of grant) shelter systems are doing displaced people a favor, but they are the ones putting them in vulnerable positions.  #endhumantrafficking
fkcd77,,fksk3fu,I think you're being too entitled.  No reporter owes you or me a tear.  You come on Reddit to tell your story and someone offers to give it a wider audience and you tell them to fuck off.  Wow.

fkcd77,,fksjvy2,Jesus, being homeless in northern New England by itself is hard enough. I used to be homeless up there, and I still remember a lot of the people who couldn‚Äôt make it through winter... shutting down one of very few resources is just awful.
fkcd77,,fksl3xa,Yep.  We have clients die every year from exposure.  If we had more beds and a handicapped building maybe that wouldn‚Äôt happen so often.  It breaks my heart when I‚Äôm sorting mail and come across a dead clients letter.

fji56e,fkn8cp5,,I've been watching your story on here and was so happy to see things turning around. What happened sis? Why didn't you just try to ask for the food? ‚òπÔ∏è Ahhh mannnnnn. Please tell me there's a way you can talk to your boss and get this sorted out.
fji56e,,fkn8k3g,I didn't ask because I'm new and I didn't want to cause trouble. Plus I saw other people doing it and thought it would be okay. I know that's no excuse but I hadn't eaten anything for 2 days before that. It was a moment of destruction and I made a bad decision.
fji56e,,fkn95ij,I understand. I know what it's like to work on an empty stomach. Not fun. Just try to talk to your boss. Tell them you thought it was okay but don't snitch on anyone, and say that you'll never do it again without asking. Or even offer to let it come out of your check. No matter how new you are, it's better to ask. Don't beat yourself up, desperate people do desperate things.
fji56e,,fko34qj,I didn't get fired. And my boss said he wasn't aware of my situation or it wouldn't have been an issue. He gave me lunch today free so I ate as much as I could. So for now I'm okay. I'm going back to work tomorrow and things are still on track for me to be able to pay my rent. I still have to make it through till then without food but I'm relieved.
fji56e,,fko39h5,Awesome! üëèüèøüëèüèøüëèüèø Glad it worked out for you. I'm really rooting for you and hope you stay on track and off the streets

fj8q52,fklsllv,,The first week of homelessness once you get a routine going is kinda fun. Feels like an adventure honestly. After about two weeks was when it really hit me. I stayed positive and still am, but I've been living in places where my name wasn't on the lease for three years and have been completely homeless now for almost four months. The dope factor is gone lol  Edit: this stretch is almost four months. I had another stretch of two and a half weeks last year, and had other stretches in hotels, people's floors and couches, and my car.
fj8q52,,fkmmhnv,Yeah my first week was bliss, no more stress or anxiety about bills, fresh air, adventure and challenge. You are in a terrible situation and your brain is trying to help you cope so you don't panic.dont worry the panic and utter fear is there your body is just blocking it out so you don't freak out, but just be prepared for that feeling to go away as fast as it came. It will be ok though, you will survive.
fj8q52,,fkn3ljj,When that feeling goes away, it smacks you like a Freightliner lol you go from "this ain't so bad, it's like camping" to "this is really screwed, I smell like shit"

fioebs,fkioids,,I was worried about that...so sorry.  I wish I knew how to help.  Our society isn't set up to support in the best of times...and we aren't in the best of times.
fioebs,fkioq95,,Homeless people aren't even a second thought for society. They are an un-thought. They are invisible.
fioebs,,fkj4llo,Some people will see this as a good thing, actually. Some people take outright glee in screwing the homeless.  It goes beyond "The beatings shall continue until morale improves." They seem to think homeless people will magically stop being poor if they get punished hard enough.  Because of some combination of sadism and stupidity, as best I can tell.
fioebs,,fkj511k,You are so correct. And honestly I feel like some of these people work in the homeless services sector.
fioebs,fkjegr5,,I heard they are shutting down our one community center on Monday. That leaves one place with only about 60 seats during the day. It also means risk of them shutting down too. Being disabled and homeless sucks with the cold weather.
fipg6s,fkip3f0,,I'm in Portland and I have a camper van that is currently vacant. If you need a short-term shelter, until Wednesday when I need to use it, you can stay in it. It's not heated but we have warm blankets, a mini fridge, and a propane stove you can cook on. And it's a lot cozier than sleeping outside. I can also help out with some food.  I ask that you collect your trash and keep in clean in there so that when I need it on Wednesday it's ready to go. If a few days of shelter would help you out, send me a message. I'm in Woodstock neighborhood.   And if that's not helpfu to youl, the offer is open to other Portland folks finding themselves outside in this snow-virus mania.
fipg6s,,fkizipg,Thank you so much, you're a hero! I've sent you a message. One thing that keeps me going out here is remembering that there are people like you out here, too.
fipg6s,,fkip9bm,I'll be out of cell service for a couple hours but if you message me I'll respond when I get back.
fipg6s,fkio87p,,I'm expecting a lot of deaths. Many of my friends still on the streets are older than 60, most have disabilities as well.
fipg6s,fkiks3l,,It's not great advise, but it is what it is.  If you have means to get canned food and can get as far away from people as possible, that's really the best strategy.  Within a week most if the US is going to be shutdown other than grocery and pharmacy.  The worst has not started.  Every American is preparing the best they can and the country is going to be very selfish for a while.  Now is the time to be as self reliant as possible.  Wish there was better news.  Try to stay safe.
fipg6s,,fkk4ih1,I hope you're wrong but for politicians, panic is the least risky response.
fipg6s,fkikpft,,I am so sorry this is happening to you. I have experienced homelessness in the PNW. I feel for you. I‚Äôm too far away to actually help you. You have inspired me to go help someone in my area. I hope you get a solution.
fipg6s,fkioisw,,Have you tried a church? Perhaps someone there knows someone who can help you. Also go to a restaurant or fast food and tell them your situation. Tell them you are hungry and you haven't eaten. What's the worst that could happen? They say no and you keep trying.
fipg6s,,fkizlrw,Does that really work for people, just asking restaurants for food?
fipg6s,,fkj29yh,I would try before I rule it out.
fipg6s,,fkkswh3,This works. Guaranteed. Helped me survive for a summer. Go like 15 minutes before they close, many of them are just going to toss out a bunch of food at that point. You'll get rejected plenty, some people would rather it end up in the garbage than your stomach if you're not giving them money, but keep trying. Some people have real heart, empathy, kindness and understanding. Just try not to be greedy, you very well may not be the only one with this idea. Couldn't hurt to ask if anyone else stops by there regularly.   Angels are real. Just look at the guy that offered you his camper van temporarily.    Edit: When I say guaranteed, note that I mean from experience I've found it works. There have been times where I couldn't find any place giving away food and didn't eat that day. If you're given enough, try to ration it so you can have some the next day if doable.
fipg6s,fkktwnf,,Why does it take situations like this for society to start talking about how its a huge public health risk to ~~shelter~~ warehouse human beings on mats spaced 6" apart on a floor, especially when many are vulnerable from age or pre existing conditions.

fipg6s,fkkryak,,Are you employed? If not, and you can be, this might be a great time to look for store shelf stocking or cleaning jobs. They will stay open, they can expect to be short staffed as some become ill so they will need help. It gets you out of the cold for part of every day.

And No one is helping the situation with Coronavirus COVID 19 with the Homeless in San Diego County!   All I know is if you need any information refer to the CDC website on the Cronovirus page Best thing to do is to void contact within 6 ft And wash your hands wash your face and keep up on the hygiene and if you recycle stop immediately and I can go back to work in the carnival business cuz it's all shutdown
fi0omb,fkenmin,,Ann Arbor's libraries are closing today at 6pm indefinitely.  https://aadl.org/node/569189
fi0omb,fkevkd8,,Seattle is shutting down all libraries and community centers for at least a month starting today. The only exception is for hygiene services at a few locations, but they are only open for a couple hours on weekdays. I'm genuinely worried about where I can use a bathroom. That pretty much only leaves parks but they might close those bathrooms too.
fi0omb,fkesmkg,,Hey, if this indeed happens, keep us posted. I cover poverty for VICE News. Hope you're well. emma.ockerman@vice.com
fi0omb,fkeg7ys,,Have they already shut them down in your area? All of the ones in my city have announced that they will stay open because health officials deemed it unnecessary to close them. I'm super grateful
fi0omb,,fkeqqhw,They shut them down in Columbus, Ohio.
fi0omb,fkelgou,,Oh they know we need/use these places. Why do you think there's been such a push to shut them down? Not just recently either but for decades. Some communities really do believe that we'll all just disappear if only they can shut down the public library, or shut down the local community/rec center, and stop people from feeding us. As if we were raccoons or wild animals. We need to make sure and hope that these places reopen after they are inevitably shut down on account of the virus.

fi0omb,fkgd2w8,,My town is having this conversation now. All the top people are saying services will stay open until the government forces us to close. It's more harmful to close than to stay open at this point.
fi0omb,fkgij3i,,Almost feels like an agenda for world housekeeping. Weed out the old sick and poor.
fi0omb,fkemb23,,I have been thinking this too. One of my local libraries has stopped all programs and events. I hope they remain open because I hang out there frequently.
fi0omb,fkeohnc,,They closed the only day center for homeless people in my city, as well as the library and community center. Elections make sure popular people run things, not smart people.
fi0omb,,fkg9jsr,In our case, shutting down the day center is being done because with some building issues, we cannot provide the ability for our guests to take showers, etc. without backing up the sewer system. This just happened to be at the same time as this virus thing has become an issue.  We'd thought about shutting it down temporarily as my wife, who is the coordinator, is one of those "high risk" people due to multiple health issues, but neither she nor I really wanted to send that message.  We were going to keep it open unless otherwise directed by the city, but we've had two big-time sewer backups in two weeks which presents a more immediate health hazard than the Coronavirus right now.   I'm quite ticked since we fought and worked for years to get this day center open.  I don't want it to be lost, and the city supports us having it.
fi0omb,,fkgborc,That really sucks.
fi0omb,,fkhlnzw,We WILL be back, though...
fi0omb,fkep0cj,,I get it. Its getting quiet around where i live & kinda spooky. Nobody doing much of anything nobody at the library or downtown parks. Bars look full at least but drunks being liars (vise-versa) could change that. Glad my last yrs grow went well.
fi0omb,fkehyvl,,The coronavirus is overhyped. I'm sorry that you are dealing with all that. Just stay strong and smart you'll get through.
fi0omb,,fkelztu,Yeah because entire countries shutting themselves down and their business operations during peace time is a totally normal occurance. You probably also think climate change is fake too.
fi0omb,,fken9qu,I tend to think that either the world governments are overly panicking, or there's something they're not telling us...either of those is more concerning than the actual sickness. The normal flu is more deadly.
fi0omb,,fketw67,>The normal flu is more deadly.  the death rate of flu patients is 0.1%. for covid19 it's currently 3.4% and that number will only increase over the next year.   covid19's contagiousness is 2.5x higher than the flu.
fi0omb,,fkf9b65,Shutting down normal societal operations to promote social isolation as a method to contain the spread of a new virus isn‚Äôt overly panicking. I can tell you haven‚Äôt actually read up on this virus if your still on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs just like the flu bro‚Äù boat.
fi0omb,,fkffgoe,Damn I've never been downvoted like this since I've been on here. All that because I'm questioning what the government is telling us about this thing? The same government that's responsible for a lot of atrocious treatment towards it's citizens? The same government who doesn't care about us in the first place? I'm questioning them and y'all are downvoting me? Dang...
fi0omb,,fkfoxwp,You're not being downvoted for criticizing/distrusting our government, you're being downvoted for spreading our government's disinformation.   "The normal flu is more deadly."   Which is categorically false. I almost upvoted your comment until I read that line.     The reason why this is causing panic is because of our government trying to tell us it isn't that bad because they're scared of the market crashing.   They care more about stocks than the disease spreading amongst the population.    Health professionals are expecting hospitals to be overwhelmed because we have made poor (almost non-existent) efforts to contain the spread.    We are following a very similar trajectory to Italy, and their citizens didn't take it seriously in the beginning either.      Please stay safe and healthy, I hope humans will be more kind and helpful to each other starting now and continuing after this.
fi0omb,,fkga4zl,Have my upvote!
fi0omb,,fkgbxcx,You know this virus is global, right? Do you think every government on the planet is lying?
fgj1hf,fk51fw0,,Love the fact that people comment purely on the headline and never bother to even read the article.  What an awesome gesture by the car lot owner.  &#x200B;  From the article.  **As word spread about Kiplin Auto and the work Charles was doing, donations of hats, coats, blankets and** **even a port-a-potty came** **in.**

fgj1hf,,fk4z4x9,The article says they have cameras and someone donated a port a potty. Now it seems the donations are flooding in and he is helping these folks get set up with housing. It‚Äôs a pretty great story in that he highlighted a need and the community has responded

fgs6g8,fk776yg,,Florida is overall awful for the homeless.
fgs6g8,,fk7ekse,The weather draws too many down in the winter. Homeless crime on homeless is not something you hear about - but it‚Äôs bad. There are aggressive and raging addicts among the generally displaced residents and there are transients overwintering.  Housing programs for Floridians are stressed. If the population isn‚Äôt managed it will explode and people will avoid shopping, tourists will avoid the area and they pay most of the taxes! No taxes- you‚Äôll see people losing jobs and becoming homeless and the area will degrade.   I owned homes in the area - lived alone in some- and have been also been homeless there. It was my responsibility to secure a safe place to sleep. I got a cheap truck and slept in rest stops and parked with permissions for that time.   I did not clog up public places and impede business nor breach private property.
fgs6g8,,fk79qso,I was at a rest stop on the interstate in the 90's, somewhere before Orlando heading south, very tired after driving, wasn't there for more then ten minutes before I was told by highway patrol to "move along", Florida was then, and is now, a borderline police state.
fgs6g8,,fk7b5lr,It really is. They wanna make this state into some kinda paradise, some fantasy land where everywhere is Disney like, and in reality, the tourists, snowbirds and retirees (and law enforcement) are the only ones who really enjoy living here. For everyone else, it sucks, but some won't admit it.
fgs6g8,,fk7dvn9,Those people you look down are why you don‚Äôt pay state taxes! They are why you have major gentrification of the entire city area- indeed fro Jupiter to Florida City.  The police with some exceptions are well trained and responsive. The tourists and snowbirds made year round living at the current level possible. The standard of living in Lauderdale has increased exponentially from the 60s.   Too much so. Tourist areas must have increased security because of the vacation mentality and vulnerability for the tourists and property owners alike.  I lived there a long time. Wouldnt go back - but your post is ironically biting the hands that feed you.
fgs6g8,,fk7rlga,Oh I'm not looking down on them. I'm just saying that those are the only people who actually love it here lol I wish them well and am glad they like it here. I just don't because I have to live and try to make a living here.
fgs6g8,,fk8hmu3,I feel your pain. Making a living there is easier than other places. I moved away and many cities have the same standard of living costs and yet the jobs and compensation are a joke.
fgs6g8,,fk7dbdd,They are cracking down on traffic accidents, muggings, sexual transactions, and attacks on homeless people.   The official rest stops are the safest and cleanest.   I am not a fan of Florida- but in validate that.
fgs6g8,,fk7d23a,The homeless don‚Äôt pay taxes. The home and shop owners do and the tourists.
fgs6g8,fk867dc,,"for the Kids"    That's just gross.
ffomof,fk0otnb,,Just another in the long list of reasons I have never been to, and never will go to a shelter. Rules: stay away from shelters, stay away from other homeless people, stay away from cops, keep to myself and mind my own business, stay out of and away from trouble - I have enough of my own problems already.
ffomof,fk4dru5,,There's been a panic at my shelter since the news of it broke. People are making money selling masks to each other, even though it's not even airborne lol shit let me get in on the fears of the stupid üòÇ but seriously, we could end up getting hit. It's not in my county yet, but it's getting closer every day and we already had our first death in the state. And with all the people coming from Tampa, Orlando, Ocala and Titusville it's only a matter of time. My wife's been sick lately too, sicker than I've ever seen her, but that's probably due to the other infectious shit at that nasty ass place.
ffomof,,fkdp0l9,C-19 is aerosolized in droplets that can linger in the air for there hours. Likewise it is transmitted through the air by coughing. When a virus is ‚Äùairborn‚Äù it means it's small enough to literally ride the air.  Masks are incredibly useful. Both for stopping you catching it, and preventing you spreading it to others. Even if the material is too wide to stop the virus passing through directly, they are still enormously helpful in stopping you touching your mouth and nose.  We can't afford ignorance right now.
ffomof,fjzpnm0,,Who cares??? Most people dont have any symptoms  and the death rate for under 50 is .05%. You are more likely to die from a panic attack caused by virus fearmongering than from the virus itself.
ffomof,,fjzpzo5,That the carrier doesn‚Äôt have to show symptoms....don‚Äôt you see that as problematic?
ffomof,,fjzpwnx,When somebody has it in the shelter, won‚Äôt everybody else get it?  Won‚Äôt they have to shut down the shelter?
ffomof,,fjzqarh,>Won‚Äôt they have to shut down the shelter?  If they are smart they will shut down the shelter then house the homeless in the schools they also will have shut down.
ffomof,,fjzqgc2,Isn‚Äôt the point that group living is unworkable in a pandemic? Where will you move after somebody gets it at the school?
ffomof,,fjzue6o,I completely agree. The flu is far more lethal than the coronavirus, yet the globe doesnt have a melt down every year over it. Only the elderly and immunally compromised have something to fear, which is every serious illness to begin with
ffomof,,fk0bze0,Thats not true, there's a fuckton of people here in Italy that require intensive care and many of them are not old, don't underestimate this virus
ffomof,,fkdp4vn,The annual death rate of seasonal flu is around 0.01%. The death rate for c-19 in Italy is 6.79%.  C-19 is more than thirty times more deadly than flu, and will likely involve lifetime complications for a percentage of people who survive, including lethargy, lung scarring, and infertility.
ffomof,,fke9zxs,No the death rate is almost to 5% and kills 10 times more than the seasonal flu.
ff4bjh,fjw3os4,,When I see stuff like this, I think if you all used brown tarps and stuff no one would notice your camps down by the river.  Thinking of my area...the blue tarps and orange gear are a giveaway and  bound to get you hassled more.  Unless you just have no choice.

ff5uaw,fjxdlgd,,In the US many of the homeless *are* working class i.e. are currently employed. Having a job doesn't necessarily mean you can afford to live anywhere, plus there are other factors like having bad credit or past evictions.

ff5uaw,,fk5xc3g,I've heard it's about 7 years. That was a long time ago though so not sure about now.
ff5uaw,fjym40f,,If you have no house its hard to get a job. If you need ID to get a job you need a house to do it. ID and proof of residency is a huge factor to remaining homeless. The system is designed against the homeless. Now assuming the person is not mentally ill or a drug attic there are opportunities to work and get you stuff together. But it mostly depends on how much you truly want it.
ff5uaw,,fjz43ey,[deleted]
ff5uaw,,fjzebkf,It's better to be lucky then good. An old Mason told me brick layer
ff5uaw,fjxl1zb,,> I would think that if there is no underlying medical issue or drug abuse, the homeless could be helped to learn a trade.  There is more than one reason for someone to be homeless. Many of these "short-term homeless" (no mental problems, no drug addiction) already *have* a trade. Many of them are already working. They just don't have enough money to rent a place to live.  Renting is expensive, and you usually need to have an extra month of rent available. There always seems to be cheap rent on Craigslist, Kijiji, and so forth. I don't know how trustworthy those offers are, however. Subsidized places can be really cheap but the expected wait time may exceed a decade.  Where I live, any attempt to create cheap apartments creates rage from people who live nearby. Legal fees are required (because there *will* be lawsuits) and the developers don't always win. It costs them so much that they would rather sell more expensive condo units (since they get paid up front by the purchasers). NIMBYism is a destructive force.
ff5uaw,,fjxvbl2,Thank you.  I dropped out of 7th grade through no fault of my own (disease) but through sheer luck and grit i made it.  I always felt bad for everyone else who didn‚Äôt get a break.

fdgbaj,,fjhn26t,As far as vehicles if you can get a prius -it will provide heat and ac all night.  Plus charge your electronics.
fdgbaj,,fjhwct4,I never thought about that...so it won't gas you in your sleep, and the battery can handle that sort of thing so long as you charge it the next day? That's a game changer
fdgbaj,,fjhxbzh,Yes it was designed to work this way.  Think about a taxi that runs 12hrs a day.  They could spend an hour just waiting at the airport.  The estimate is that it will turn on for 5 minutes every 30 minutes to maintain state of charge in the battery.  There is a facebook group Prius Camping which is full of useful information.  From memory I think it is .2-.3 gallons/hour but the owner of that FB group can tell you exactly because he has been doing it for 5 years.  I think models after 2012 have NO BELTS.  And the small 1.5L gas engine runs in a different combustion cycle from a regular gas engine.  Newest models 2020 auto timeout after 1hr when kept in 'ready' mode.  There are work arounds afaik.

fdgbaj,,fjigmue,I'd been living in a LEASED vehicle (cheaper) for the last 5 months.  Just bought a room for 3 months off some friends.  Have to move or return to the car end of april.   This is not your fault dude.  It's a systemic economic issue.   At least accept and understand that and know you are not alone in this.
fdgbaj,,fjhqxim,Good point, also a Camry hybrid. Same internals as a Prius, so you can still have all-night AC without burning a ton of gas.
fdgbaj,fji5st8,,Most shelters are part of networks called Continuum of Care (C.o.C.). These networks often have programs called Rapid Rehousing that fast track people out of shelters and into apartments if they are employed and can manage self sufficiency in a few months. You seem to be a good candidate but the record will definitely hurt your prospects with landlords. Ask about rapid rehousing at the shelter. If they are unhelpful, DM me what city you are in and I can try to provide you a contact.
fdgbaj,,fjidcbv,I'm actually in Vancouver, Canada. Things are a bit different here job wise and in regards to housing, but they do have some skeleton programs that I dealt with before that may be able to set me up in a place someday. It's not easy to find a place that is safe, not overrun with bugs and rats and dealers with those programs though.
fdgbaj,,fjie0l6,This place might be able to help you:  https://www.westcoastgenesissociety.ca/our_services.html  I know someone who works there.  Yes, you're going to be living with offenders, substance abusers and men with mental health issues - but it is 1000% times cleaner and more orderly than a homeless shelter.  There are strict rules that apply to everyone who lives there.  Getting a good nights sleep isn't a thing you'll need to worry about.
fdgbaj,fjig7i2,,Believing in most of the Marxist drivel in these comments will only keep you homeless.   Prove your worth enough to someone that will help you. Either by renting you something or allowing you a place to stay until you can be self sufficient   What most people don‚Äôt realize when you are down and out is, for the vast majority of people, you will need at least one other person‚Äôs help, trust, and reassurance.   Sometimes the hardest thing to do is ask for real help from someone that is able to give it. Why?  Because it usually isn‚Äôt free. It may come with qualifiers and or demands. That‚Äôs ok. That‚Äôs being part of something and answerable to someone else. It‚Äôs being productive.   You may need to make a new friend or swallow your pride in many cases and mend an old family relationship or friendship.   People do this all the time without even admitting it to themselves.   Keep working, maybe find a construction gig that travels.  Then they put u in a hotel.  Or try an apartment caretaker position that has housing.    Good hunting. Keep active.
fdgbaj,fjhadd6,,you obviously know what you need to do and that is half the battle even if you are not sure how you are going to do it.  kick that shit in the fuckin nuts. You are gonna make it and shit is gonna work out.
fdgbaj,,fjhaoxk,Thanks bro. I will keep trying.
fdgbaj,,fjhc097,one foot in front of the other foot.  Just keep thinking that.
fdgbaj,fjhbygk,,Blue collar homeless...you work your ass off...but the ends don't meet. There's no easy answers. Can you afford a 5x9 storage unit? That's you stuff baby wipes are better than nothing. $12 showers at flying j...i spend about $10 daily for at least one solid meal. A good buffet is a awesome value. I'm crossposting on my sub...
fdgbaj,fjhbv80,,Often times, It's not even about getting a job. I have a full time job, I work over 40 hours and am still partially homeless. Why? Because I can't afford the most basic apartment (small studio) in my state (NY).   The problem isn't you, the problem is and has always been systematic. At this point, you just have to do what you can for survival. Reach out and check on as many resources as you can to get a leg up and just keep trying your best, that's all you really can do.
fdgbaj,,fjiw4h4,This is another example of blue collar homelessness...
fdgbaj,,fjigjci,Yup.
fdgbaj,fjhdznm,,I'm going to put myself in your shoes here and tell you what I would do, because I've been there, no matter how much I work I'm one medical bill draining my bank account from homelessness again.  First, find a shelter of your own.  Take your first paycheck, everything if you have to, and either buy a car that runs, and can get somewhere safe to park and sleep under if it breaks down.  At least you have locking doors, and if it gets towed, it's cheap.  Otherwise, same thing I would take my first check and find the cheapest roommate I could on craigslist.  A couch to rent for a week will bring your strength up more than sleeping on the streets.  Even if you can only afford a week, there's your shower, shave, and laundry.    You'll find you should be able to afford 500 bucks if your working full time even minimum wage, but some couches are at most 200 a week.
fdgbaj,fjhmilk,,Honestly my friend I have given up pursuing having a ‚Äúhome‚Äù and instead started pursuing having a life. All that stress you just expressed immediately faded away when I found a simple relaxing job just working three days a week.   Dishwashing should be the way to go, the only way you can not be hired immediately as one is if you don‚Äôt have your ‚Äúdocumentation‚Äù otherwise everybody has a criminal record and the last kitchen I worked at all the dishwashers were homeless. If you look inside and feel any negative thought towards the idea of washing dishes then perhaps consider adapting a positive response for something you perceive to be a negative experience. I never in my life ever thought I would be a dishwasher, in fact I looked down upon such work. Then with the grace of God I humbled myself, and now I look forward to the act of washing dishes as it has become a deeply meditative experience for me. I view each dish as a former idea or thought once in my mind and I'm simply wiping away the harsh filthy negative thoughts to each dish or idea, creating a fresh new and clean dwelling place for new positive ideas and thoughts to emerge.    I would strive for a car you can fully extend in, then go from there. Leave the shelter, and work slow and easy. Focus on the stress and remove it as gradually as you can. Patience will be hard but I promise you the more stress you are able to eliminate the lighter you will begin to feel and you will eventually find yourself in awe at how good you begin to feel.   Avoid junk food, and all drugs if at all possible. This is crucial for removing any fog in your mind.   If you are able to successfully work at least three days a week, slowly start to find more things to do. Volunteer at a food bank or kitchen for seniors, or at the vet. Keep all the intimate details of your situation to yourself and don‚Äôt actively seek out help from others and you just might find people starting to become drawn to you and offer you help. Maybe you find yourself a saintly woman while volunteering and have yourself some companionship. If you are lucky you can find somebody understanding of your situation and will still desire to spend time with you and invite you into their space, share their bed with you. If you are blessed then you just might find yourself a wife as I did two years back.  Church services are good to attend, libraries are great places to hang out. If you are kicking any habit then attend a meeting with an open mind, and build support networks.   Depending on where you are geographically could drastically alter all the variables I mentioned to you. If you are in a harsher climate then it might be wise to pursue migrating to somewhere more warm. Honestly I just finished a stretch of being ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù in Hawaii for 4 months and it was an amazing experience. I discovered a common rite of passage for many people there was showing up to the island with nothing, only to slowly manifest everything. If you are considerate of the environment and leave places better than they were after you leave you will discover many blessings there.   God bless you my friend, may you find the kingdom of God within! Peace be with you!

fdgbaj,fjhbubh,,The answer most here won't admit to you is... You're not. Homelessness is a threat to the working class, and criminalized across the country. Blame is placed on the individual rather than the system that creates homelessness in the first place. Fight like hell to crawl out, and remember that the richest of society are to blame. We need to rise up, together.
fdgbaj,,fjiczwy,Housed person who lurks here so I know how I can help and have some insight: We need a revolution badly but the majority of the country hasn't woken up from their phone/game/distraction induced coma. I have a hard time believing this is all done on "purpose" (i.e. big business, politicians, lobbyists) as in they're probably not having meetings and trying to figure out how to fuck us over, more that they've become addicted to the power and money and don't want to see the reality they've created change because that would mean a drastic change in their lifestyle. Whatever their actual reasoning, we need the majority of the country to wake the fuck up before we can have a revolution that doesn't resemble Tiananmen square.
fdgbaj,,fjigidr,I've built a system on paper that will fix this.  I've been chronically homeless since age 18.  in and out in and out.    I know im just some asshole on reddit but I can fix this.   It will take 15-20 years to execute though.  No short term solution.
fdgbaj,,fjii70f,Yeah, I've thought about it also. Kinda why I'm a teacher..... If I can get a few kids to actually think critically then that's a win in my book. Curious what your plan is if you don't mind me, you could dm me or i could dm you an encrypted email address I use if you're worried about stuff getting out .
fdgbaj,,fjimpkm,In this case I'm not.  I can keep it simple here.  In this case the need is so great I dont mind the idea getting stolen.  I dont want suffering.   We need to build pod hotels like in Japan and India.  They must not rely on finance.  That's step 1.  My system can do it without finance, and then build non-subsidised traditional public housing that works on a sliding scale.  But I need pods first to do it.    I am willing to go into greater detail but I'm an early sleeper and laying in bed on my phone.  I'm looking for people interested in helping execute this.  Currently I am first working on a business plan to enter the market with a high margin for profit business that will franchise giving me access to enough capital to start this without going broke.

fdgbaj,fjj3k5c,,The short answer is you are not supposed to make it work, and most people wouldnt care if all homeless people just crawled off into the woods and died.  I'm sorry you are going through this.  I hope things turn around for you.
fdgbaj,fjhqoqh,,>But, for the love of me, I can't figure out how on earth i'm supposed to be able to wake up so early in the morning and slave away doing physical labor when i'm not even getting 3 hours sleep, whether i'm in a noisy smelly shelter, or sleeping outside in the rain.  How long have you been doing this? From my own experience - sleeping in an alley while fully employed in a retail job - your body will adapt, the exhaustion will get the better of you and you'll start falling asleep at the drop of a hat when you need to. It's not pleasant, it's less than ideal, but you'll get over it.  >dead end jobs are not enough to get me a place  Consider saving up to move elsewhere. When I was homeless in the Bay Area I simply could not afford to move into a place, and I couldn't simply move on without quitting my job (which I eventually did) because I don't drive. I ended up moving all the way out to IL because I had a guaranteed job and housing out there.
fdgbaj,fjhvklh,,You should reach out to social services in your area.  They are FULL of people who don't work and there are options for people who do - like half way houses.  They aren't just for former addicts.  I don't think the half way houses even care so long as rent is paid.
fdgbaj,,fjid3i2,Well, I'm from Canada and it's a bit different up here, but I'll call around and see if I can get into a good halfway house. I definitely know there was a recovery home set up for recovering addicts in a good neighborhood in my city a few years back, so I'll go around and hope for the best.
fdgbaj,,fjie8kk,Canada has free healthcare, but no temporary housing assistance?  Not only is it a physical health issue, it's a mental health one.  You said in your post that your at the end of your rope.  That qualifies you for mental health services at the very least.
fdgbaj,fjj3j18,,Dont give up man. Even when you're at your lowest see the light at the end of the tunnel. I've worked for 50$ a day doing hard as work at a warehouse now I'm doing construction too and man it does open doors. Also a tent, if there are any areas that you camp out maybe you can hold out a bit. Also co workers any nice ones ask? Ask if you can pitch a tent in their bank yard and you'll pay to rent out the area. Keep trying Everything you'll get there I promise.

fdgbaj,fjhb48g,,I managed to find somewhere to live but not a job? I'd love a job now.
fdgbaj,,fjhb7td,I hear you man. I usually stay in shelters so I don't have to sleep outside, but if you've ever been to one you know how annoying they can be!
fdgbaj,,fjhbhzz,Yeah I got kicked out of mine for falling asleep between 12 and 6.  This was after I lost everything, was extremely tired and worn out. My apatite was fucked and my brain was closing down. I realised everything that I had lost them bam go and sleep on the rows. I didn't even get to see my dying mum before she went because I was that fucking fucked. I'm still fucked now my life isn't going to be the same.
fdgbaj,fjiyxl1,,I‚Äôm sorry the people at that shelter were so heartless towards you. That‚Äôs so horrible and demoralizing. For what it‚Äôs worth, I think you have all the cards stacked against you because society is not kind, but I have hope for you. You sound like someone who is really dedicated and hard working and I hope things turn around for you soon.   Have you looked into local charities? I know my town has an emergency housing program. I volunteer at a shelter and we team up with one in town. You remind me of one of our success cases last year (one of my favorite guests)- he had a rough past but landed a job in a metal forming factory. He had to work so hard, but he did it. The local charity paid for first/last month‚Äôs rent for him plus essential furniture.   If a similar program exists in your area, I believe you would be an excellent candidate since you are currently employed in a reasonably lucrative field and are actively working to lift yourself out of poverty.

fdgp67,fjhgbvb,,I really wish there was a template folk could follow so helpful people could tailor the information and ensure it's relevant. I'm glad you're reaching out. Things are bad for a lot of people. The social safety net isn't something people talk about.     Do you live in the United States? East coast? West coast? Big city, small town? Family and friends? Employment? Savings? Skills? Assets like a vehicle? Have you tried applying for SNAP? 211? Are there any shelters in your area? There's often a waiting list, but sometimes there's ways around the waiting list, it all depends on where you are. At least in the US, there's no standard homeless response kit. There's no pamphlet, "So- you're about to become homeless."     You said you have until the end of March. That's good. That gives you time. You can use that time and make it work for you. Start by calling 211, if you live in the United States. It's a community help line. Just say hi, and that you need help. Tell them what you told Reddit. That's all they hear, day in and day out. And they can give you the information most relevant to your location and abilities. It's literally their job to handle situations exactly like the one you're in, right now. You wouldn't be their first, you probably wouldn't be their first caller that day, or that hour.

fdgp67,fji5xwh,,How are a group of homeless people supposed to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you off your ass? You realize they expend more energy in a day getting themselves cleaned up and fed than you do in a week? If sauntering to the fridge is a challenge for you, perhaps you could use a little houselessness. No one can ‚Äúhelp‚Äù you with that. It‚Äôs something you go through yourself.

fcz9q0,,fjfe58t,I feel you man. I did the same shit. One day I just snapped. Before I knew it, I was 1,600 miles away from home. Then another 800 miles. I just couldn't take it man. I felt like my family was judging me. I had quit the Army, and while nobody would dare say anything, you could just feel it, the way they avoided it all together. And it was that bubble they put me in that broke me. So I left, just me, my truck and $1,400. I got a job in my current town within 3 days. I made a friend, now i'm renting out a room. I've got a long way to go, but I regret nothing. I'm just sad my family won't be here to see it.

The night previous you are dehydrated, sleeping in the woods...you had no money for food? Of you had money on you but did not think to buy a cheap motel room or a ticket home....  I dont know if God exists either but I am sure he would think this does not sound right.

fbw810,fj73bf5,,Thank you for being so kind. I can understand the invisible feeling, but in a different way. I‚Äôm working through Family Court while homeless and believe in dressing nice to show that even if I don‚Äôt agree with everything they do, I respect the court. Because of this, I don‚Äôt look like a ‚Äútypical‚Äù homeless person, whatever that is. At the shelter, people have mistaken me for a lawyer or a caseworker because of how I dress. Because of this, nobody really would talk to me. They don‚Äôt realize that I am struggling, that I am lonely, or that I may not have eaten in days. I‚Äôm being forced out of the shelter because I have been there too long. I have no idea where I am going to go, and I‚Äôm scared. Sometimes I wish that someone would help me, but I don‚Äôt dare ask for help. It‚Äôs like I am invisibly homeless, it‚Äôs hard to explain.
fbw810,,fj9li1m,Yeah your stuck between trying to represent yourself as presentable and getting people to acknowledge you need help. Your trying but you still need some help off someone. Unfortunately there is no-one there to help you dude you have to do it all on your own. I had help but it was outweighed by all the crap I had to deal with. You know who to go to when your homeless and for me it was a surprise.
fbw810,fj6udxr,,This post brought tears to my eyes. I have been homeless myself, though I was able to stay with relatives, and I've always sympathized with those who don't have a place of their own.
fbw810,fj6txe6,,this so much this!
fbw810,fj6w1xa,,It‚Äôs a blessing just to be SEEN as a human being.  After a while you start to wonder if you‚Äôre invisible.  Thanks for being kind to this person. ‚ù§Ô∏è
fbw810,fj719qa,,Thanks for just being a good human being to another human being and treating them with dignity and respect.
fbw810,fj76956,,She needed medical care, not just to be "listened to". It's like you listened but didn't hear.
fbw810,,fj773po,I don't have a car, nor am I a medical professional or a legal adult. I'm not in any position too provide that. Doctors know of her condition (which is why she was complaining about ride to care) , her family and friends know of her condition . There's really nothing I can do about that aspect.
fbw810,,fj7q12g,I've been homeless, several times. Not all homeless people feel invisible, not all homeless people want to have conversations with strangers. It sounded to me like she was seeking actual help. That doesn't mean it was your obligation to do so, especially if you don't have the means. But you also don't get to decide that the only thing you were able to provide is exactly the thing she needed or wanted.
fbw810,,fj8ekgp,Don't get me wrong, I know that and I'm not trying to speak on behalf of all homeless people, I don't go up talking to every single one of them. In my area, a reservation people are extremely poverty stricken , and people get pissed off when they come up to them, since the people they go up to are on hard times themselves. I have family and extended family who are or have been homeless and the majority of them talk about how people would just drive or walk away like they didn't exist and how they always felt so lonely . I know it's a first hand opinion of yours, but if something is out of the kindness in your heart, the will to want better in the world and for people to be there for others if it's a necessity for that person. Is it really something to be all cranky about? . I really can't believe I have to point out the fact I'm not hardcore telling people "go talk to ALL homeless people" I'm just saying they don't get enough attention, and if more people did do so, there'd be more people in positions to help them who can empathize with their story and want to help them. It's all in good spirits, why try to shut down an opinion that's with good intentions.
fbw810,,fj8ws28,Giving my own opinion isn't shutting yours down. But I don't know why I bother. People would rather feel good than do good. I'm just trying to point out the difference between the two.
fbw810,,fj8x6xh,Some homeless people want someone too listen, some just want resources and actual help. It's all in moderation, idk why it's gotta be black and white, it's not like a self righteous complex thing with no intention to actually take action. Sorry you interpreted it like that, thats not my intention. Just because I don't have the means too help, that doesn't mean others who won't be influenced to step forward don't.
fbw810,,fj8zj35,I think you misunderstood what I'm saying.
f9vl1z,fiu3xoz,,Just take it day by day OP. You seem very resourceful  as it is. This is only temporary.
f9vl1z,,fiugcnq,Yeah, day by day. Temporary? I'm honestly not so sure. I'll live, it takes a fair bit more more than this to take me down. As for temporary...   I can forget about getting a job while sleeping outdoors. And I can't get an apartment or a room without a job. At this point starting over from scratch doesn't even feel like something I want to devote the rest of my life to, I'll just be stuck forever catching up.  Maybe it's straight up better to embrace this shit and make omelette of these here fucking lemons.
f9vl1z,,fiupdwu,There may be some luck involved, depending on how stuck you are. The key is to keep your opportunities open and be ready to jump. The more people you know the more opportunities you will discover.
f9vl1z,,fiukks9,Everything is temporary. We live in a capitalist hellscape, you don't need a home to be labor for someone elses profit. Hygiene is important, find a shelter in your town. Some places even have a  mobile shower truck or something. Also, maybe drop the alcohol to a lower level. You drinking in the library will give everyone here a bad name when you inevitably get caught. I don't need the local library having more reason to be suspicious of street folks.
f9vl1z,fiu7rf5,,Disposable wipes...does a body good...
f9vl1z,,fivvej6,Yeah and cold showers are a thing so why not just bathe in the river or lake?  Too cold? Then make a fire and warm some water in a bucket.

f9vl1z,fiuogf9,,Google "Laundry Love" in your area. People will show up at the local laundromat with a bag o' quarters and soap and pay to launder your clothes.
f9vl1z,,fivy45l,How nice of them. What is that about? :)
f9vl1z,,fiw2zdr,Its a church thing. Our local shelter uses it during its winter season, which is sadly almost over.
f9vl1z,fiucz6p,,Baby wipes (the best brand you can afford, if not the store ones will do fine too), bird baths at gas stations and rest stops, gyms like the Y or Planet Fitness, will be your best friends during this time. I take it you're avoiding the shelter, which is good, because ask any of us who ever had the "pleasure" of ending up at one, it's not good. (Case in point: there was a man who waited to get his sentence for some misdemeanor he caught, the court wasn't open that day, a Friday, so he had to wait till Monday to get his jail time. He kept saying all weekend "fuck this shelter shit, take me to jail! I wanna sleep and shower in peace!" And that's not the first time I heard that from someone who did time and also lived in a shelter. It seems pretty common that jail > shelter, and this is in Florida, a state with one of the worst prison and jail systems in the country.)
f9vl1z,,fiuhxu7,Yeah. Actively avoiding it. They do offer showers and laundry, though, so I'll probably pop in from time to time for that, but I'd rather sleep outdoors in my dingy tent all day any day.
f9vl1z,,fiuifja,The showers are the one and only thing that is better about the shelter than living in our car. Nasty as they are, at least it's better than having to bird bath at the library with Peeping Toms. I ate and slept better when I lived in my car.
f9vl1z,,fiuq8r9,A bed to sleep in during the day. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner without waiting hours in line. 2 showers a day. Hilarious drama going on constantly. Time to work out, read, improve my life  It sounds pretty good to me. I'd make more progress there than in the shelter I'm at currently. I'm just afraid to go to jail.
f9vl1z,,fiuqs74,Ditto here. That man was deadly serious when he said "take me to jail!" No getting up at 6am and shuffled in two separate lines, one to give your SSN and one for the actual food, and getting shuffled out the door before 7. The people in jail are also said to be more trustworthy in jail than in a shelter. At least in jail there's consequences for being a piece of shit. In a shelter you can steal without real fear of getting beaten up OR kicked out.
f9vl1z,,fivvn2z,I dunno about improving your life. I mean, when you go to jail, that shit stays on your permanent record and can seriously mess up work opportunities.
f9vl1z,fiunwps,,Hey bud. Army guard vet here. You don't think it will happen but it does. Hit me up if you wanna talk. Your experience will help you through this though. I don't mean to make light of this but shits a cakewalk having the experience from living outside. Hooah, muh fucka.  PS, try and find a local church or org to help you out with laundry. Shoot me a message on your whereabouts and I'll try to help you find resources

f9vl1z,fiu3nkt,,Start traveling
f9vl1z,,fiufx6c,Not sure this is a wise idea at the moment. I have no chance carrying all my gear along with me as is, as I don't have a car. I'm decently familiar with my surroundings here, and also have a few friends scattered around the greater area. Traveling right now would introduce way too many elements of uncertainty that I don't have here.   Don't get me wrong, I would love to, but I don't see it happening, at least not without way better gear and when it get's a little warmer. Forecast says 21F the coming nights, I'm not taking any chances this early on.   Thanks for the input though, of course.

f9vl1z,fiuaz9h,,My advice would be to stop purchasing alcohol and use that money for a basic gym membership to get showers.
f9vl1z,,fiufi3k,Yeah, and that money could be spent on food instead of stealing which hurts the situation for others too. Drinking should be a last priority if you can't take care of your own basic needs.
f9vl1z,,fiuh7b7,My drinks cost me $2 a day. I manage. Basic gym membership costs $250 one-time yearly payment, that's the cheapest there is around here.

f9vl1z,,fiuluyh,You're the type that gives homelessness a bad name.  Drinking while stealing food.
f9vl1z,fiuhu67,,Take up dumpster [diving](http://homestylesurvival.com/wp-content/uploads/SurvuvalPdfs/miscellaneous/The_Art_and_Science_of_Dumpster_Diving.pdf) for food and clothing.   Laundromats sometimes have a sink you can wash a few items in. Bar soap or shampoo works OK. Dyers are often very cheap compared to washing machines.  A camouflage [tarp](https://rollingfox.com/how-to-make-a-tarp-tent-with-designs) is lighter and cheaper than most tents.  Get a sponge and wash yourself in the sink in a restroom. Any container to hold some warm soapy water and you can go into a stall in the larger restrooms where you can't lock the exterior door. Dry off with a t-shirt or paper towels.
f9vl1z,fiw62j4,,When you find that glorious hot shower, wash your clothes while you wash yo body.
f9vl1z,fiwcg85,,Wash your clothes in a public restroom. Preferably a private one. Use their soap (or your own detergent/soap equivalent) and wash your clothes in the sink. Then take a garbage bag and line the bottom with LOTS of toilet paper or paper towels. Place your wet clothes on top of the lining. Spread out the garments as wide as possible to maximize surface area to paper lining. Place another layer of toilet paper/paper towels on top of the wet clothes. Repeat until your bag becomes a clothes lasagna. Apply pressure to bag and it's contents to expedite drying.    -Make sure to wring the water out your clothes as much as possible.  -Be sure to use LOTS AND Lots of  toilet paper so it doesn't fall apart and get tiny fiber bits stuck on your clothes.  -Paper are made up of fibers that will readily soak up all the water up (capillary action!) and out of your clothes.   It may not be the best way, but cost-effective and it's a great way to dry clothes rather than waiting around like a sitting duck for hours.  Another option (one I used to maintain clean clothes when I was homeless) is to take your clothes with you into the shower if you have access to one (Google gyms in your area and check out their website. Most gyms offer 1 week free trial in exchange for a sales pitch.) Shower yourself and wash clothes at the same time!   If you have any truck stops in your area, I'd try asking truckers of you can have their shower card. Be honest and be genuine when asking. Most truckers won't have a problem giving up their shower to someone in desperation. Who knows, you might even meet someone cool that may want offer assistance.   Stay safe out there man. If you're bored or have nothing better to do, pm me. It's nice to have open and accepting lines of communication when you're constantly dodging any sort of negative attention in real life. People tend to stay in their heads all day and will eventually go crazy/act out because of that.  You know what they always say...  Be good. Or be good at it.
f9vl1z,fiu79wa,,Stay off the dope. It's everywhere.
f9vl1z,,fiuh8e2,Not an issue.
f9vl1z,,fiuy3u7,Good, I hope you don't think I was accusing you of it.
f9vl1z,fivl4gi,,okay, first, stop stealing food. you served you know army core values are quiet valuable. you are going to have to ask for help, it doesnt need to come out of someones pocket. ask that closing pizza guy if you can get the pies before they hit the dumpster. or just go to the grocery on a tuesday and get all the free food out of the dumpsters at night. get a gym membership.  try googling [mturk dot com](https://mturk.com) and start on that. the pay is TERRIBLE but any money is good from the way it reads. next step would be to stop drinking and travel more. find a purpose. ask everyone and thier mother if they know of a place to work. dont be proud take anything. coworkers can be a blessing in your situation aswell.  get a gym membership and wash your shit in public restrooms and wear the shit at the library. the first few days is hard but the 3rd or 4th month are rough as a muthafukka  if you just need someone to talk to to stay sane send me a pm Ill be your friend.

f9vl1z,fivv2zs,,Question, if you don't have anything holding you to where you are right now, couldn't you consider hitching or taking a bus somewhere less cold?
f9vl1z,,fivv8v2,Also, there are a bunch of sites that can hook you up with volunteer jobs and/or paying jobs which provide food and board. [Workaway.com](https://Workaway.com) is one option but there are plenty. I've been homeless for the past 5 years travelling through Latin America and I always had a roof over my head (when I wasn't sleeping in my tent)
f9vl1z,,fivyrxa,Thats inspiring! I am in Latin America too now.   How did you manage to live in Latin America without being homeless? What kind of jobs did you do?
f9vl1z,,fiwc7q1,It's pretty easy being houseless when you are on the road. People juggle at streetlights for a living, sell food, sell handcrafts, busk, regular jobs (like service work) and/or do volunteer jobs. For example, hostel gigs. Most hostels in Latin America have a staff made up of volunteers who work for room and board. Then, you just go outside of whatever town or city you find yourself in and just see how you can make money.   People skills is, for me, the most important thing. And staying away from hard drugs. You can be a stoner on the road, that's easy. But hard drugs and alcohol, they will shatter any opportunities to meet chill people that can help you.   Couchsurfing is a great tool to find places to crash and meet locals. Workaway is great, also, for volunteer work in farms or hotels.   I've worked in plenty hostels and done every job I've mentioned above. Always had good experiences, always met awesome people, and never, I mean never, slept on the streets alone and scared. I've had some rough nights, but never got robbed, jumped, or ran with the wrong crew.   Last hotel I worked at was in Bacalar, here in Mexico. That place is paradise, and this hotel was right in the middle of the jungle and the property was on the lake. Every day before my shift (reception) I was swimming in paradise. And after my shift, a beer at night and then to sleep. Repeat. They paid for all my meals, water, and gave me an RV to live on. I was also making some money on the side by selling tours to guests.  And I keep wondering why people have a hard time being houseless. No need to suffer if you know your way around this lifestyle.
f9vl1z,fiwxvo1,,I hope this is a very short and temporary setback for you. Good luck.
f9vl1z,fjh4nzc,,After a year of homeless living,  we landed an apartment. Have been under a roof for just over a month.  But, there was a lot of hard work to get here.  Having a job when homeless and not giving a hint to anyone that your vehicle was you living room, bedroom and kitchen.  There are two of us,  so we both had an income to be able to pay for a home.   Shelters locally offer free showers and you don't have to be sleeping there to use the shower. Now I am working for a community outreach non-profit at the thrift store.  Husband is working for the State part time. We have lots of things we had to learn about when confronted with being homeless. So if you want to know some tricks on survival,  we are here to listen to you. We too were in a tent! You have the internet,  use it to search for local agencies that will help you.  We are in New Hampshire and know what it is like to sleep fully clothed in -10 weather. Keep positive and keep in touch.
f9vl1z,fiuxzms,,Did you get a DUI that prevents you from driving? A vehicle would be a huge upgrade. Ask churches and the county welfare for access to a laundry facility. Get into AA for the alcohol. Get food aid to avoid getting a criminal record from stealing.   I was #YangGang because I believe if everyone had $1k a month their lives would have a HUGE improvement over this patchwork of incomplete programs.  Hope life takes a turn for the better. At least Spring will be here in a few more weeks.
f9vl1z,fiuvgll,,Yo join a union
f9r00l,fiuo9kx,,Military experience helps. Stick to your field manuals and FOB TM's. That info is invaluable
f9r00l,fiu0jti,,Huh
f9r00l,fiuipez,,What country's military you are talking about?  Genuinely curious.
f9k7zt,fis3zly,,Well then he should move to one right now.
f9k7zt,,fivf5ic,They arent billion dollar nice. Only 60,000 a year nice.  Sarcasm
f9k7zt,fis7fkq,,I've been in a mission for over a year and there's nothing nice about it. He's a moron.
f9k7zt,,fiu2zaw,"The showers are resort-like, the food is restaurant quality AND it's free, you're surrounded by friendly people who care about you, and instead of paying in cash you just use your social security number. What's not to love"  This is why rich assholes shouldn't get to buy elections. Bloomberg makes Trump look like...well he's still an asshole, but at least he's the asshole who had a TV show and a semi-attractive daughter. (Grasping at straws I know)
f9k7zt,fisxg2a,,What an out of touch, scumbag billionaire thing to say. Eat the rich. That is all üôÉ
f9k7zt,fiswyjt,,they are really bad. You have to sleep with shoes on or someone might steal them.
f9k7zt,,fit0c58,My brother slept in his shoes and they still stole them.
f9k7zt,,fiu46b4,Just this past week someone stole: 2 pairs of pants, 2 phones, a charger, a purse, a bag of chips, 3 pairs of headphones (one was mine), four lighters (one was mine), a Black and Mild, and two packs of cigarettes. Oh, also a whole bookbag.  If Bloomberg brings his rich, out of touch ass to any shelter, since they're all so nice, he'll be a walking lick the first night. They're not gonna wait till he sleeps, he's gonna have to fight from day one üòÇ
f9k7zt,fitk8ja,,420% real fact: Bedbugs aren't real, it's just homeless shelter staff biting you at night so you won't stay forever. You know, since shelters are so damn nice!
f9k7zt,fis4uui,,Bloomberg? Gross
f9k7zt,fitv1rj,,Baahaa . Now that is funny. I do not know what he really meant. The article is a little skewed against him, but IF that NY shelter is nice, then it has my shelter beat all to hell.  If you like B.O. and noisy mean people and getting your sh\*t stolen while you are just using the toilet real quick, shelters are the best.
f9k7zt,fiu23x9,,He tryed this crap in ny
f9k7zt,fiuk92b,,Go move in one then
f9k7zt,fit0v34,,Dude is such a piece of shit, not even a trump guy and I really hope trump would win over him
f9k7zt,,fiu4aq9,I would vote for any Democratic nominee except Bloomberg, if he's the guy #Trump2020 me please.
f9k7zt,fivp5rd,,Not from what I've been told. That has to be a joke.
f9k7zt,fiu22am,,If it came down to this guy or Trump, I'm voting for Trump twice. Better the asshole we already have than the asshole who's just like the asshole we already have who pretends he's better.
f9k7zt,fiu35j0,,I‚Äôd vote for Trump before I vote for this fucking clown.
f9k7zt,fj969r7,,They look nice from his view in his ivory tower.
f9k7zt,fitl27s,,The Intelligencer reworded what Bloomberg said. Bloomberg did not say "so damn nice", the quoted words that were mentioned in the article state that the shelters are a more pleasurable experience then they used to be and that kids used to sleep on benches. In the same article it also talks about a program that he started which gave funding to homeless that were working to enable them to afford renting a place.. Neither of these things are negative.
f9k7zt,,fitl7ag,The article was accurate and it didn‚Äôt even mention the policy Bloomberg tried to institute that would have required that homeless people pay a fee to stay in shelters...you know because the homeless have so much spare money.   I see you are following me around Reddit now and defending Bloomberg.  If you are taking money from Bloomberg I hope you got whatever you felt your soul was worth.
f9k7zt,,fitm5ko,Not following you around, i'm posting a reply to the article that was trending that you happened to post. Bloomberg hasn't given me any money. I was just shocked to read the headline because I don't think he would say that and I was right, he did not.  -Line
f959ud,fiprq1r,,You might need a routine. Find a cheap coffee shop or diner to grab a cup of coffee every morning. No one cares, use the WiFi, use the bathroom, read a free newspaper, get to know the staff.   I liked to get my vehicle away from where I slept before the sun came up, so I'd use the 24 hour Planet Fitness gym real early too. Knocked out my morning shower as well, then I could go to work.   The important part is that if your car is the part that gets to you, and where you are when you feel the worst, only be there when you have to be. You could even go to a Walmart or other 24 hour place just to walk around and get out of your car.
f959ud,,fiqvou4,Thank you
f959ud,,firwbg3,Best of luck, man.
f959ud,fipp2aq,,I have awoke too many times in the last two months in my '91 Honda Civic in the middle of the night to start then warm the car and then move it to different spot, so I don't get harassed by the local PD.  Mostly it's me (55M too) alone but I've accommodated as many as three others on some nights.  On nights it snows, those are the best.  The muffled sound of the city by the big snowflakes floating almost directionless during a mid-winter night storm are truly a beauty to behold.  I have shelter, blankets, quilts, pillows, some food and water, radio, heater and the golden liquid that powers it all.
f959ud,,fiq6ui5,It‚Äôs different at our age. You‚Äôve found some beauty in it. I remember one particular sunrise at 19 degrees, fully dressed and in a sleeping bag in my backseat. Wiping away the condensation on the window and the tears off my face - to see a spectacular display of colors in  silence - alone at a rest stop - they don‚Äôt hassle you there. Then bursting into tears at the sheer beauty I wouldn‚Äôt have witnessed and perseverance I would not have felt - seeming a consolation gift because this is my life now...

f959ud,fiqefzo,,Hey I am 53 and a car dweller too. I understand how you feel.  I know this doesnt really help but, reading your post I felt less lonely. So thanks for that. I have a hard time understanding why there are so many people like us. My brother always wants me to stay at his house but I feel like I‚Äôm disturbing his family. I am also a head trauma survivor so everyone thinks that its ‚Äúthe accident‚Äù that made me this way but I think if I just had a little warm room and a bathroom of my own, my whole life would be totally different. With my income I cant afford $1000 a month. I keep thinking I will wake up one day and there will be a place to go, nope.
f959ud,fipl1l5,,Hey your not alone, I'm sleeping in the passenger side of my gfs car everynight. You could fit a mattress in a Prius I've seen it on YouTube
f959ud,fiq7r58,,IMHO in our age group it‚Äôs different- at least for me. When even a bit younger I had ambition, determination, pride and hope.  I had time, energy and inspiration. Now I do not.   Loss after tremendous loss, theft and humiliation yet I tried again and again - smaller life each time to be less a target...and always end up here alone asking, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô I have a tiny place I am renting and helping 2 others for the winter. Gone through two jobs I walked away from. A disorienting relationship wasted the past year. Never good enough. What‚Äôs the point?   Everything I accomplished and invested in for decades was obliterated or given to a person that was undeserving.  One of my only feelings is how tragic that there are other truly lovely people fighting for their lives, begging for one more day to be with their loved ones and use their talents and skills and I‚Äôd gladly trade places with them, but can‚Äôt.
f959ud,,fiu0p75,Jokes on you, I didn't have any ambition, pride, or any point with life *before* I became homeless! That's the trick!   Sorry for joking about such a serious predicament.   Honestly, writing and cracking jokes is all I care about, and it seems I might be able to actually make a living out of it in spite of my homelessness. I started posting about my adventures online on various forums and in the past few days I've accumulated $60 in donations!  They called me the class clown- who's laughing NOW!
f959ud,,fiu3btu,Laughing > Crying.   Online comedy- obvious choice since you can‚Äôt stand up in your car.
f959ud,,fir0jqs,[deleted]
f959ud,,fir4kye,Thank you for making my point exactly... well wait...  ...have left is right here...  ...all that remains is right here...
f959ud,fiq0ux8,,Working and being homeless is a really frustrating combination to live through.  It's bizarre, like something from 100 years ago, come back to a society which was better, then slipped back by it's own collective choice.  I recommend Vitamin C and and a hot drink for the mornings.  You're living through history, so be proud to be alive at least.
f959ud,,fiqvjfi,Thank you. I will try vitamin C and a hot drink in the morning
f959ud,fipuey0,,I wish I could help you. Are you in Australia?  If you are in SEQ let me know.
f959ud,fiqgtu0,,I live in a car and hate mornings too. ESP waking up and needing to urinate so bad. Drive to WM or  McD's or BP. or anywhere close and semi friendly. Usually sit as long as possible in restroom or at a table, til my mind gets right. That takes longer and longer, for my mind to steady itself, as time passes being homeless, my mind has reached a point of sluggishness. There is so much to think about, just getting dressed somewhere, going to work, finding somewhere to park for a while til I need to move along.  Where can I blend in, where can i access a restroom...what can I do about my skin and hair deteriorating. It is all such a chore. And I am tired.
f959ud,fipk7t3,,Thanks for sharing. Your life may be broken but despite that you are valuable and there is a God who LOVES you so much. Please hang in there and let me know if I can help talk you through some things.
f959ud,fiqk0c7,,I feel. I have a day off work and I'm just sitting here like "well what now"
f959ud,fiqmq7a,,You are in my prayers.
f959ud,fja3ab4,,I just turned 54 and I never had I thought that I would ever be homeless one day.  I took care of my mother physically and financially until she passed away.  I left a great life in another city to at first help her recover from having surgeries.  She suffered complications afterwards, became disabled, totally disabled and eventually Stage Four Inoperable Brain Cancer.  I had absolutely and utterly no help from my siblings or other family members, agencies, organizations, churches, charities you name it.  When my mother passed I was broke and lost everything.  I tried to educate others after what had happened to me especially the facts that Social Security, Medicare and other insurance agencies do not pay for all things medically necessary nor a 24 hour a day caregiver that being me.  One of my siblings eventually offered for me to stay with them, I was working for a company whom did not pay me for six weeks, this was during the government shut down and my sibling literally physically threw me and my belongings out because of such.  I have no car.  I've told everyone I WISH I had a car to sleep in.  I've applied several times to charity websites.  I started a GoFundMe page to raise money to purchase a used car, insurance, license plate, etc.  No luck so far.  I'm trying to get my link out there.  I'm disabled and was wrongfully turned down for my benefits like so many others losing ten years of back benefits in the process.  I came back to this small town, which I wish that I had never done as it was hard enough getting out the other two times I managed to escape, in response to a live in position which was far from what was discussed.  I scrambled and found another live in position as a personal driver, but after about a week and a half the gentleman moved back home up north.  I was dropped off in front of my storage unit by the gentleman's relative.  I had no where to go.  This is a small town of no resources and no help.  I stayed at the one and only shelter here until I was exited for used days.  I lived on the streets for over two months, have stayed with whomever offered for me to stay with them, have had countless living and job offers fall through and most recently am staying whatever nights I can at the same shelter for what they call weather nights when the temperatures are very cold or there are bad storms.  I'm currently facing almost a week of no weather nights and back out on the streets.  I've been attacked staying on church property of all things, stalked, harassed, gotten injured, gotten sick repeatedly from exposure to the elements and have had my belongings stolen.  Like another commenting I've witnessed the beautiful sunrises and sunsets from the streets.  I've sunk about as low as I possibly could not wanting to go on so many times.  I question, I pray, I don't know or understand what I did to deserve or live like this literally on the streets.  I've tried to help whomever I could my entire life with whatever I could.  It's like a never ending nightmare.  Others in the shelter have moved on with their lives and some keep returning.  I've never begged for help before in my life until I became homeless.  More recently I've thought the only way out is for me to walk out of this small city or get a bus ticket to another city from a charity.  Everything I own is in a storage unit currently up for sale.  I pray that there will be a miracle and I will be able to save my belongings.  Because of the weather and lack of transportation I spend my days at Starbucks using their wifi to apply for jobs daily online.  I used to spend part of my day at Wawa, part at Starbucks and the remaining walking the streets.  Walking the streets at night is dangerous in itself.  The homeless here are not allowed to sit or sleep on city benches or sleep in the parks.  There is currently a class action lawsuit against the city, local police and I believe the mayor as well as to how the homeless have been treated.  The worst in the country actually and posted online world wide.  I do have one friend whom I met in the shelter who has been incredibly supportive.  He recently got his disability case approved and was moved into a HUD vash apartment.  He let me stay with him for a few days, but was told by him he's not allowed to have overnight guests anymore per management.  I think sometimes as bad as you think your life is, there are far, far worse off then me.  I'm hoping, praying that by December my life will have a far different story of success and being back on my feet and financially stable for good.  "Thank God I don‚Äôt own a gun or a knife because I know I would not make it through that early morning period."  You made my heart break and made me cry because I know exactly what you're talking about.  I'll pray for you and every homeless man, woman, child and pet out there.  You're not alone.
f959ud,,fjp9mte,Thank you, I know that they are just words but you will never know just how much what you wrote means to me. I know that it was just for a few moments but just for a few moments things actually seemed a little bit brighter, thank you for that.

f8j4fg,,filnwut,Sending good vibes your way!
f8j4fg,,filw4y4,Time to update your flair for this sub :)
f8j4fg,,filw6a8,You're right!
f8j4fg,filpywd,,Congrats!  What a great feeling you must be having right now.  There are places out there that will give vouchers for things like furniture and kitchen supplies.  Check places like st Vincent's or salvation army.  Not the best stuff in the world, but it eases the mind of one less burden.  Good luck and sleep well under your new roof!
f8j4fg,,filq48f,Thank you for the suggestions! I'll give em a call.
f8j4fg,,fim47ep,At salvation army ask for a manager if you are looking for furniture. Both SAs I shop have managers who will negotiate the price. If you can somehow prove to them that you were recently homeless, sometimes they will give you things that didn't sell of give you a substantial amount of money of the price.  I bought a very nice Broyhill sofa at SA for $8.00 a couple of years ago; it was like brand new but didn't sell because it had a floral pattern.   It never hurts to ask!  Check the dumpsters at donation centers, too. I always see furniture sitting next to them, free for whomever. I've verified this with managers.  Also, look on Craigslist under the free section.
f8j4fg,filtm7r,,Nothing like being able to lock the door and crap in your own toilet...congrats
f8j4fg,,filu56z,Thank you! And right?....its the little things.

f8j4fg,,filtv94,Don't fall for them rent to own places... folding chairs work...and air mattresses
f8j4fg,,filu7xk,Oh no, we're not....those places are super expensive!
f8j4fg,,filufwk,And the "furniture" is crap...but be careful about used stuff too...bed bugs...if you can find a layaway place maybe...
f8j4fg,filxhcg,,Buy hard furnishings and stuff like dishes and such from thrift shops! You can get cheap mattresses on amazon without the worry of bed bugs, and they get delivered!
f8j4fg,,filxlw8,Thank you for the advice! I reeeeallly don't want bedbugs.
f8j4fg,,fily87v,You REALLY don‚Äôt! I just ordered a full size mattress from amazon for ~150 and it‚Äôs actually pretty comfortable. But shit like coffee tables, shelves, etc are fine to get from thrift shops!
f8j4fg,fimrdzu,,r/dumpsterdiving,, the streets provide. But I highly recommend mattresses, cushions, etc, be chosen very carefully, bed bugs, but everything else can be cleaned. I have a studio, 21 days housed today, and had nothing. Everything has been given or found with some people who knew me from diving started to leave beautiful things out a couple of people waited until they saw me to ask.  Silverware set, glasses, dinnerware set, a bed frame, perfect dining set for my space, 40 inch TV. It's been amazing. It is kind of nice to have things from "outside". It feels like they are getting a second chance too.
f8j4fg,,fimrp0w,I'll definitely keep an eye out. I live in a pretty low income area tho, so I dont know how much luck I'll have. I'm happy that you were able to get into a place also.
f8j4fg,,fims6gv,Rich people bring their stuff and dump it illegally in those areas. I have a gorgeous side table and chair that was dumped.
f8j4fg,fim69e9,,I'm so happy for you! The same happened to me In July I didn't have any furniture (I still don't kind of...) but I'm grateful I have a place and I'm grateful you have one too!!!

f8j4fg,fimspv4,,I‚Äôm happy for you! This about sums up my first, second and third times moving in somewhere, all after backsliding and ending up homeless. It‚Äôs better to sleep in an empty place (that‚Äôs actually yours) than in a car or on the streets. I moved in about a month ago (almost 2) and I‚Äôm only just starting to fill the place with furniture. Everyone‚Äôs experience is different, don‚Äôt let the feeling of not having stuff discourage you.  Check the pantries and stuff for furniture. A lot of cities have places where you can get some stuff for free or for really cheap. I don‚Äôt know if you have experience with this sort of thing but usually there are resources for your exact situations. Local shelters might be able to help you out too (with information, if nothing else).
f8j4fg,,fimt1zv,Yeah, I can deal with it being empty right now. As you said, it's better than being outside. We're definitely gonna be making some calls today. Thank you for the suggestions!
f8j4fg,fimy7uc,,Go to your local Catholic church and register as a new member as you are "new in the area " ( whether you are Catholic or not ) then explain your situation. You will get a voucher for the local St. Vincent DePaul, they have furniture, household supplies and clothes etc... . You won't have to spend a dime.

f80ezv,fiicuqx,,Holy fuck. This  This is EXACTLY what I am working on as a project. A way of sharing in real time my struggle with homelessness, adhd, anxiety, toxic family and legal troubles, and addiction... all as a means of distilling my journey, and the journey of those I meet along the way into an ever expanding resource guide that can be used to call up any solution to any other person's problem when they need it. From shelters to soup kitchens to jobs and personality tests and therapy and harm reduction and legal advice. Everything. Eventually extending it to become something that supports myself and then supports those around me who are helping me make this a reality. It relies on transparency with my actions and behaviors and thoughts and feelings and even how I spend my time and  y money.     Transparent emotion: this post made me cry so fuck you in the nicest way possible
f80ezv,,fiif44w,Lol @ the "F you". I'm sorry, and I am sorry you're dealing with so much. If you can only help one person, you've made a huge accomplishment.   The obstacles are challenging, but don't give up. Someone needs your help to get them through their issues.   Xo üôè
f80ezv,,fiimbq8,My only problem with actually accepting that helping one person is enough, is that I'm 200% sure my project can help EVERYONE and so I guess I found what I'm going to kill myself to achieve.   Bukowski I think said: "Find what you love, and let it kill you." Or something like that.    I love life. And all the creatures in it. I couldn't ask for a better death. I just hope I have life enough to give to my vision, before something happens. Or god forbid, before time happens and I grow old and complacent. The worst death happens before you're buried.
f80ezv,,fijrvi6,Sometimes you are unable to reach many people bc they are not ready. By helping one, you're helping that person and this person will help others. That is what I meant about helping one person.
f80ezv,fijex8o,,So true.. it's happened with a few situations in my life and I'm hanging onto hope that this is another.  Thank you for this.
f80ezv,,fijrzei,You're in my thoughts. I really hope you succeed in whatever your definition of success is.
f80ezv,fijf49k,,The light might be there, but someone forgot to turn on the switch, because I don't see it and I've all but given up on trying to see it.
f80ezv,,fijrmpv,You have to ask yourself, and be very honest with yourself, "Is there something that I can do to change my circumstances?  Am I using all available resources? Am I being proactive with my job search/personal goals?"   Life isn't easy, but you have to make a choice: fight or flight. Change your perspective or change your circumstance.   You can do this! You have an inner strength that has brought you this far. We are all stronger than we think. When I asked the Reddit users for resources, not once did I ask for money or accept money. I asked for resources to help me earn the things I needed in life. This was two weeks ago and my life has change drastically.   Last month, I wanted to die. I didn't want to commit suicide, but I hoped every day not to wake up. If I give up, who wins? My abusers have won!   Your light may be a tealight candle, so it's extremely difficult to see, but it is there. Please don't give up.
f80ezv,fijlact,,Unless you're survival guide doesn't fit a popular narrative...
f80ezv,,fijquxx,Hi,   I think you took the quote too literally. All stories are not identical and often, not unique. Many of us have experienced complex and chronic trauma. I am sure there is something you have experienced that will help someone else.   I was molested as a child, abandoned by a drug and alcohol addicted mother-who did not know who my father was, raped as a teen, beat up by eight people at once after trying to stop a fight, grew up in foster care where I was re-abused, raped as an adult, survived two domestic violent relationships and the last DV relationship almost cost me my life.   Honestly, what I have shared with you above is the PG-13 version. No matter what, someone has experienced at least one trauma-related event. Trust me, this crap hurts, but I refuse to allow my past to cripple me. My past made me stronger and more loving. My past will help another woman or girl and she will then help someone, and so will you.  :-)
f7c0id,fialwro,,That‚Äôs a euphemism. Most people call police to assist the homeless to get them out of their neighborhood.
f7c0id,fic4ahq,,I've said this before, but with all the money the government wastes on unnecessary expenses, they could do wonders for the homeless. The government, by the people for the people. Ha ha.
f7c0id,fiadwjj,,Yeah leave you tf alone or hassle you. I'm getting real confused.
f7c0id,fibs0l2,,My hometown starting cracking down on people parking in their RVs in parking lots overnight, because one person was found dead in their RV. Doubtful he could have been saved by police involvement any sooner and now everyone gets harassed. It sucks. Hope things get better for you soon.
f7c0id,,fibvizt,That sucks about that fellow. I'm not completely irate and illogical. I get that some things have a reason, but I had to bring this up because it's been bugging me especially lately. I was normal once, too! I'm not complete scum! I just have some problems, I'm human, damnit.  Thank you, I hope so as well.
f7c0id,fibg009,,If someone called the cops on me I'd be in big trouble. Aside from the police in my area being insanely corrupt, I have booze and weed stashed on top of an unregistered firearm. So 90% I get shot 10% I go to jail
f7c0id,,fibl4xw,Can you buy a firearm without a address? Jw cuz I'm thinking about purchasing one. I wouldn't tell the guy but I'm wondering if anything needs to be verified by mail or some Bs(Colorado).
f7c0id,,fiboc7l,Nope. I live in South Carolina tho and admititly had an address when I bought my first one from Academy (great deals btw) but I was never asked for one. This was for a shotgun. My 1908 Colt Police Positive Special is amazing and bought secondhand with markings missing so technically an illegal gun
f7c0id,,fibpgpl,I don't know about Colorado state laws, but by federal law:  If you are buying from a dealer (or an individual who wants to do the transfer through a dealer),  you have to put an address on the background check form.  They don't verify it AFAIK, or mail you anything, but I assume it's a crime to lie.  If you are buying from an individual who doesn't insist on doing the transfer via a dealer, you don't need an address.
f7c0id,,fibx7t1,Thanks this answers my questions
f7c0id,,fibuyss,I hear that. I might get locked up if they catch me at the wrong time, but it's more likely I get some empty platitudes and told to leave my bando.

f6fvnv,,fi6d846,I wish I could explain how crucial this is to me, what Im receiving from you and our fellow redditors. Thank you √ó10.
f6fvnv,,fi73yd3,I read a comment where you mentioned you‚Äôve been sleeping outside the library I think. I‚Äôve been homeless twice before in my life, I‚Äôve done the same thing. I dont know exactly what you feel because every situation is different, but I can appreciate parts of what your experience might be. There are some parts of homelessness that are consistent, like cold and hunger and the constant not knowing, the ambiguity of it all. You found a path out of it and you went for it. That‚Äôs terribly difficult to do, to find an opportunity, and rally the bravery in yourself to take a chance on it. I really hope you get it. out of the 70+ people remember you have just as much chance as anyone else does and it could definitely be you. And if you don‚Äôt get it remember that this is one of many opportunities that you will find and you WILL find something else. You will not be stuck in the unknown forever. I don‚Äôt know you but I can tell that much for certain, even from across the internet. You got this. PM me if there‚Äôs anything I can do to help. Research, emotional support, anything else. Anything I have the means to do, I will do it for you. Truly, I mean that - anytime of day or night if I‚Äôm awake I will be here with you. You have an ally out here in internet land.
f6fvnv,,fi7ojwp,I really dont know what to say. Im totally overwhelmed. Im very grateful.

f6fvnv,,fi5x07y,Moments after my post, I walked around the to the entrance of the building because it was getting to be that time. I saw a line of people across the damn office plaza. I counted 70 people then stopped counting. It never occured to me that I would be competing with so many. That makes me sound really dumb I know.    All those people can suck it though.  Im better, I deserve this,  Its my fucking turn!!

f5v10y,fi3fbqc,,Please report this and any correspondence to:  https://www.reddit.com/report
f5v10y,fi0xdjb,,Scammers are scum. Scammers who try to scam those who literally have nothing are the worst kind of scum. Scummers.
f5v10y,,fi0xp6u,The worst part is that I know for a fact that is what this person was trying to do. Someone tried to do it with my account before and I almost fell for it then. If not for the fact that I upset the person doing it. They explained what they were doing and how easy it was for them to make purchases on my account.
f5v10y,fi12iei,,There's a lot of that going on here.  a couple years ago I was about to be homeless and desperate and trying to sell some of my things, a man offered me twice what I was asking for a doll, then when the check arrived it wasn't an amount for about five times more, he said that he wanted me to take the pay for the doll and give the rest of the money to the man that was coming to pick the doll up.  I was so excited I needed the money and this was like $4,000 I was holding in my hand. A check with my name on it all I had to do was go to the bank and cash it.  I excitedly told one of my friends and they said it was probably a scam, that if I cash the check I would get the money but about a week later it would be taken back out of my account because the check was fraudulent.  I cried and cried and cried and asked myself why there were people like this in this world.
f5v10y,,fi133zb,Yeah I've had people send me a fake check. I simply asked why and why they sent 2. They said basically the same thing. So I waited a few hours and texted back saying that my bank wouldn't take it and they called the police. I said I turned over all my info to the police and they were able to get a finger print from the check. So the person never talked to me again lol
f5v10y,,fi3dh9f,Yeah fake check is a common one.  I'm so sorry this happened to you, your story gave me a mental picture of you waiting all excited then crying once you found out   touched my heart. I hope that you're in a better place now
f5v10y,fi18a4x,,This just pisses me off.  OP, glad you didn't go for it, BS that someone is trying to take advantage of people who are already vulnerable.
f5v10y,,fi18rh3,Don't get me wrong a few people have already helped me. I have $47 towards my goal because of people on here.
f5v10y,,fi18z25,Which is why I still hang in this sub.  No longer homeless, but if I have an extra $10 or more, I like to try to help someone else out.  Been there.  Good luck!  :)
f5v10y,,fi19t3d,Yeah I'm a big fan of paying it forward.
f5v10y,,fi1a3j5,Yes!!
f5v10y,fi125gl,,This sounds like that Peak6 Investments scams. Same exact thing of being aggressive with asking for a bank account.  I saw this on r/antiMLM  Part 1 https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/f5e5ug/what_is_peak_6_investments_and_why_do_they_need/  Part 3 (I can't find Part 2) https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/f5epor/the_final_part_of_this_3_part_saga_this_person/  Part 4 https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/f5eqva/sorry_yall_just_got_this_glorious_response_part/   EDIT:  Please read this story as it has similar tactics! They go after people with no money in their bank account, ask for your debit card, deposit money using stolen checks and overdraw your account. It sounds like this is a very similar approach.   https://qz.com/1803141/instagram-influencer-arrested-as-alleged-debit-card-scam-unravels/
f5v10y,,fi1ltcb,That makes sense now, thanks.
f5v10y,fi15gu9,,I had a similar experience around December/January. Someone PM'd me with an offer of financial help and I thought our prayers were answered. First red flag was when he wanted to text instead of PM'ing through Reddit. He said he was going through a divorce and his wife had all his bank details so he couldn't send money directly, but if my banking app would let me deposit checks, he would write one and send a picture of it. It was way more than I was asking for, and he said it was for family; that I could take however much I wanted as long as I forwarded the rest to his "grandma". Noped the fuck out of there and reported him to the mods.  Fuck scammers.
f5v10y,,fi18loc,What's worse is preying on people who already have nothing.
f5v10y,fi133mv,,I fucking hate scammers and how government doesn't even try to protect us
f5v10y,,fi138ba,Our government has bigger issues to worry about. Like how many luxury vacations they are going to get this year.

f5v10y,,fi1l8xi,Still active means even though the piece of shit can't post, it can still send PM's. This thread might just put enough light on him that he quits trying because too many people know his name, and goes back under the rock he lives under.
f5v10y,,fi1mi4u,I really hope.
f5v10y,fi1s0gp,,So, wait ... someone is trying to steal from a homeless person???? What kind of scumbag would do that???
f5v10y,,fi1t17j,Basically the person acts like they can help the homeless person and talks about how they can deposit money into the homeless person's account. After the scammer has the info they need they use account info to either sign up for cards online or if the homeless person is really dumb they will give out their card details too. The scammer then uses the account to buy things online like tvs or video game systems. Once purchased the scammer has another person (usually also unaware) pick up the product and mail it to either the scammer or a middle man. The middle man basically gets the item and mails to the scammer. I knew a guy a few years ago that was one of the people who would pick up items for a scammer and he didn't know. He only kept doing it because he was promised $10k but the scammer always had some dumb excuse like they lost the tracking number of western union. Or PayPal won't let him make a payment that big. Needless to say the scammers don't have to be good at what they do so long as they prey on people who are disabled or in my case so tired I can't function.
f5v10y,fi498ht,,Crappy people trying to take advantage of the weak and poor. Truly scum of the earth. The worst part is probably the false hope they give you too. Hope things work out for you!
f5v10y,,fi4bcqt,Yeah I have gotten a lot of false hope.

f658el,fi2x4hr,,A question. Does the collar hurt him when his neck is bent. Also is it ok to remove them for pet to sleep.  I don't have any pets so no idea.
f658el,,fi2yiy7,Yeah it's important that they don't wear them 24/7. My cat gets insane scabs if she has it on for over a couple days, and in general ot's just nice for them to scratch any itches and not have anything pulling on their neck like a leash
f658el,,fi3g65a,This. He gets his collar removed at night most of the time. At first he was sleeping with a collar and leash on. Didn't know if the sound of raccoons would make him try to go full out koolaid man through the side of the tent. Turns out, he doesn't give a shit about chasing them üòÇ
f658el,,fi45dk3,"full out koolaid man through the side of the tent", lol, best description üòÇ
f658el,,fi30n1y,Thanks for info. We have street dogs and to prevent them being captured by animal control, we were thinking of pet collars. But street dogs are not trained as such though they are very nice and friendly.
f658el,fi48z59,,He's cute. I always wonder how people get dogs when they're homeless. I'd like one too, but I feel like I wouldn't be giving a dog their best life. I actually just got a room for the first time in a year so it made me remember my dog from years ago. How'd you get yours? Stray or from before you were homeless?
f658el,,fi7qk9k,I found him as a stray about a couple years before I ended up on the streets. I have no one to look after him, and he gets horrific separation anxiety if I'm anywhere out of eyesight. It may not be the best life, but he's very much loved and well taken care of
f658el,,fi8prxy,That's awesome. I'm sure he loves you a lot. I hope things keep getting better for you two.
f658el,fidc7iz,,Good doggo
f5sz8w,fi0sgof,,thanks for the repost
f5sz8w,fi5mnuv,,Really want them? Handicapped, mental illness, aged persons, youth, etc. This implies that being homeless is a choice being made by the homeless person. This horrendous hell is not a choice by the vast majority trapped in it's awful suffocating mire. A cruise boat sailing in and rescuing me from myself and this society who has deemed the homeless as a demographic closer to the dogshit on the bottom of shoes than to be allowed basic human rights, food, water, shelter,  how grand, how so super easy.  I could list a plethora of reasons why you are unique in this instance, ID, passport, birth certificate, health records, socials, no legal barriers or travel holds, no excessive outstanding debts, no children, no community ties through housing/shelter lists and restrictions, free communication resources, call back numbers, doctor appointments, medical restrictions because of locality, travel restrictions, clothes for work, travel necessities, etc, but I think that's enough to list to highlight why your title and your comment is entirely selfish, self serving,band highlights that you were never really homeless. Several of what I listed were available to you readily, or others suffered, kids, family you ignored while you obtained documents, money that should be spent in other areas spent on this, I can elaborate on my points if requested to do so, but I doubt you were as homeless as you stated in the very beginning.
f5sz8w,,fi6jh2o,Room and Board jobs are not for everyone, for obvious reasons, and I do not *(obviously)* imply that they are a cure-all to being homeless...   Room and Board is in my wheelhouse, and has saved my ass several times, I do regret that in my past I did not meet the qualifications, that you seem to be arbiter of, that I was not *homeless enough*; had I known that I had to check the veracity of my state of being with you before hand, I would have indeed filled out the available paperwork and received my official badge and moniker, alas as you were not there, but here, pointing out the obvious exclusivity of anonymous persons attempts at helping in a very complex and multifaceted problem, when they publish *one way,* instead of *all ways* to confront a problem, I am indeed remiss that I missed your codification of my actions and will make prior arrangements in the future to remediate this the next time I even think about *becoming homeless*... There are always critics, which is a good thing, but I did not expect a visit by captain obvious...
f5sz8w,,fija6ze,Well when you post telling people that there are "easy" ways out of their situation and that there are "thousands of jobs available", it does not reflect much of an understanding of the reality that many homeless face.
f5mss2,fi3ydis,,I‚Äôm a little confused by the wording of one of your sentences, but that might be because my grasp of English isn‚Äôt 100%.  What do you mean, ‚ÄúThis is to help spread awareness to the homeless community to seek more help.‚Äù ?
f5mss2,fi5pi4s,,Is this a high school project? I'm assuming it was put up for a critique? I'm certainly hoping so as most of the facts are not correct and the wording leads to a general belief that the homeless population has still brought this upon itself.

f299zp,fhdgen6,,I can only speak to what I‚Äôve heard. I‚Äôm not on the streets (yet) by the grace of a relative with infinite patience. Unfortunately it also means I am low priority for services. However, if I were at a shelter, my case worker has told me they assess people in various ways to determine priority for services. And basically, the worse your circumstances are, the higher you ‚Äúscore‚Äù. But this is obviously contingent on local resources, and number of people who are higher priority. So maybe those comments were more of a hint that it would be easier to help you? I dunno, just a thought.
f299zp,fhemkzw,,At least it's a bright spot in an otherwise dark place. If you can't laugh at the circumstances, you won't survive

f0wqse,,fh2m52x,Thanks!
f0wqse,fh2n1sc,,This story is why I came to reddit. I'm so happy that you're off the streets. Miracles like this give me hope!
f0ic7j,fgucb1y,,I think not. Maybe two weeks.
f0ic7j,,fgucifa,I mean if you only have 2 weeks to live lol.
eykk74,fghrsar,,hey is everything ok?
eykk74,,fghv6p5,Yeah its just a bit hard to afford a place to live at the moment
eykk74,,fgi2bad,i feel you
eykk74,,fgi8ghe,I hope things ease up for you soon, I wish I could do something for you guys
eykk74,,fgjo82c,Thank you so much! The kind words help a lot and hopefully we wont be in this situation for much longer
eykk74,fgip0ge,,Beautiful kitty...bet he's easier to share space with than even a small dog
eykk74,,fgjo55c,I cant even find him in the car sometimes and I get freaked out and think he ran off somehow but then I see his head pop up from somewhere lol
eykk74,,fgjo9sy,I used to travel with a cat... yep same thing happened to me
eykk74,fgiqsea,,I'm so sorry about your situation but yes love your kitty. It will get better  keep your faith strong  hugs
eykk74,,fgjnzm3,Thank you so much ‚ù§
eykk74,fgiu7zn,,What a pretty kitty! Although it's unfortunate they're experiencing this as well, it can be easier to bear homelessness with a loved one beside you every step of the way :)
eykk74,,fgjnycp,Hes definitely helped keep us sane! Hes the best cat and I cant wait to get back in a place so we can get him all kinds of cool things for being such a great cat
eykk74,fgiw097,,You are So fortunate to have people with you through this. Best of luck.
eykk74,,fgjntab,Thank you!
eykk74,fgjdzsy,,That's one handsome cat! I love when cats are cool with being on a leash and being in a car. Most aren't. Hope things get better for ya.  I am curious. How do you deal with the heat of the car and the cat? I get how truck drivers do it (I knew a dude that was a over the road truck driver with his cat. It was great seeing people's faces when they saw the cat up in the windshield stretched out sunning herself instead of a dog. lol) I always wanted to get a dog but worry about them being in a vehicle while I'm at work in the summer.
eykk74,,fgjnr9u,Thank you ‚ù§ and luckily it hasn't been very warm but there were like two days where it got hot. When my husband works I'm normally with the cat so we dont normally leave him in the car by himself more than an hour at a time and we check on him periodically. One of the best ways to keep him cool though is opening the back part of our car so he can get to the trunk for some shade and then we crack the windows and blast the cool air for a while. Also always keep water out because that helps a lot too
eykk74,fkuspte,,Why is government not doing shit to help the homeless.  But will hold off eviction for others. Many of us had situations like this. But only select citizens get help  This country cant deal w an emergency omg all elected officials need to resign
eykk74,,fkux84i,Yeah we had to ditch before we got evicted because they wouldn't hold it off for a bit
eykk74,,fkuxfxg,I'm sorry yet I understand it sucks. This country sucks. We have no b.c elected officials that know what to do. However they are in their jobs cause of us
eykk74,fghrle0,,Be careful with your cat. Be ready to kill any dogs that would try to harm it!
eykk74,,fghv5dy,Oh yeah we have designated areas and always make sure there arent any dogs around first. I don't wanna have to kill any dogs lol
eykk74,fgjg75p,,We're leash training our car kitty now, they love the drives but hate the snow! lol
eykk74,,fgjn6vx,Yeah my little dude seems to like the rides and going outside but we may end up with snow soon and hes never seen it! So idk how that'll work out lol
eyaf93,fgfz9lo,,In bag:  - Mason jar full of water (don‚Äôt have plastic, figured he might be able to refill it by leaving it open in the rain)  - Protein Bars - Tim‚Äôs Potato Chips - Apple  - Gingerale - Dried cranberries  **UPDATE**  Thank you all so much for the recommendations. My guy wasn‚Äôt there today, makes me a little nervous. I‚Äôm hoping he took the money I gave him and maybe found somewhere to stay for the night. I added hand warmers, toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, ziplock bags, chapstick, Tylenol, and a massive jug of water in a plastic container. I hope he‚Äôs there tomorrow.

eyaf93,,fgh2fhg,That's a swell score.  Sweet and classic.  Very cool
eyaf93,,fgh3778,Thank you :)
eyaf93,,fghsiya,Socks. Always socks. If it's cold gloves and long underwear but that might be out of your budget
eyaf93,fgg2j6i,,Depending on the area where you are, if it gets cold, some of those hand warmers things are great to have.
eyaf93,,fggcrzq,Smart it‚Äôs absolutely freezing so I‚Äôll get some. Beanies and socks on the list too.
eyaf93,,fgh3ppg,Tell him that he can make the hand warmers last significantly longer by putting them in an airtight Ziploc baggie after use. That's if he can quit using it. Also chapstick! Hand lotion! The world needs more people like you!
eyaf93,,fgh41q2,I‚Äôve added all of those to my list and I‚Äôll be sure to tell him if he can understand me. Thank you :)   One person at a time, right?
eyaf93,fgg273z,,Great idea and kind. The only thing I would change is go to the dollar store and cut a plastic water bottle. The mason jar is heavy and the glass can break and cut the person and possible infection   etc. or a simple bottled water line Core (water bottle brand, its disposable) is a heavy duty plastic bottle that will hold more and wear better.
eyaf93,,fggcw6k,I know I was worried about the glass cutting. But it‚Äôs big enough that he would be able to reuse it. I didn‚Äôt have time to get a plastic bottle that would also be reusable and really wanted to offer him water. I‚Äôll try to get one on the way instead. Thanks for the advice
eyaf93,fggdapg,,If he does not have a backpack, go to a thrift store and get the largest college book bag you can get.  Mountaineering pack packs scream homeless and you want to blend in as much as possible.  Balaclava ski mask  One size fits all magic gloves to use as a liner under work gloves.   A one liter plastic water bottle.
eyaf93,,fghduta,I have a North Face backpack he could use. It‚Äôs just a regular backpack for school - nothing flashy, except the north face logo. But as I‚Äôve said he is disabled and I‚Äôm worried he wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry it. I didn‚Äôt see him today so hopefully he will be there tomorrow. Definitely keeping this in mind.
eyaf93,fgg5f71,,A travel size baby powder, baby wipes, socks, hand warmers, eyeglass cleaning wipes... Which are great for also cleaning phone screens...
eyaf93,,fghdq0m,How does baby powder help? In the same way as baby wipes - for cleanliness? Hadn‚Äôt considered that ever so I‚Äôll put it on my list.
eyaf93,,fghliu0,Keeps you dry, makes you feel fresh, covers bad smells
eyaf93,,fgit7kr,Really good to know. I‚Äôll get some in stock. I hope I see him today. Thank you.

eyaf93,,fggd0pg,Thank you. I take this to heart.   I had considers rubbing alcohol but because he had a mental disability I‚Äôm concerned he might drink it, poisoning or even killing himself. That‚Äôs why I thought the baby wipes would be good instead. Is this a valid concern?
eyaf93,,fggj46v,I don't know your friend, personally.  At least I don't know if I do. Wipes don't work because the  paper is already soaked and it deters the flame somehow. If you use regular paper to ignite the fire it's much better. It works like a  wick. As to your concern about your friend drinking the rubbing alcohol, it's possible but unlikely. It's not like you're sending him a gun. I'm going to guess his more pressing issue is the wind chill and the sleet we've been experiencing most nights. Not to make light of mental illness,  God knows I've got my share, but if you're going to worry about him drinking poison you may as well worry about him slashing his wrists with the envelope.
eyaf93,,fggni7j,I was referring to the baby wipes as cleaning rather than rubbing alcohol. But for fire I totally understand. Thank you for all of this if I can get him to talk I‚Äôll find out if he goes somewhere warm at night or needs fire supplies.
eyaf93,,fgg70eo,What's the rubbing alcohol for? Genuinely curious. Would alcohol wipes work?
eyaf93,,fgg7aey,Same thing the hand sanitizer is for. It's flammable and you can start a small fire in a coffee can. I use it for heat nights when I can't afford propane
eyaf93,,fgg7jvy,Ahhhh cool. Very good to know, I hadn't thought of that.
eyaf93,fgg7089,,Tooth brush, tooth paste, soap, deodorant

eyaf93,fggyq7k,,If he doesn't already have one, track down one of those Seattle resource books published by Real Change. They released an updated version recently (lavender cover this year), and a lot of social service agencies have them to give out to folks in need.   Also, after working in shelters, I second the folks who mentioned socks and hygiene supplies, for sure, along with the recommendations of the guy who is also homeless here in Seattle. One thing in our clothing donations we were always lacking is belts, and it was one of our most requested items. Does he need a good belt?   I asked my partner who has been homeless in WA in the past, and he suggested lotion and chapstick. Perhaps also an emergency poncho, he says. He also suggests cough drops and over the counter pain relievers.
eyaf93,,fghedjq,Got some Tylenol, chapstick and lotion. Working on the extra clothing and will totally consider a belt the next time I see him (he wasn‚Äôt there today). I‚Äôll get him the book you suggested once I can confirm he can read. I‚Äôm even hesitant to give him the Tylenol or any sort of pain medication because if he took too many it could do harm. So I might hold off on that until I know him a bit better. Thank you and thank your partner!
eyaf93,,fghfb0k,I think that's a good call with the Tylenol. Overdoses of that stuff are no joke. Maybe give him just a couple at a time?

eyaf93,fgh2i9f,,Socks! I read somewhere socks are under donated.
eyaf93,fghbqf9,,A sturdy rain poncho or umbrella, clean socks,  a lighter
eyaf93,fghwhi2,,Ask him. Remember, he will likely have to carry everything you give him in addition to his regular stuff. So its easy to overload him. Books, batteries, a trip to the laundromat, a blanket, winter coat, shoes, all these are things that can make a big difference. And whats welcome one day might not be the next.   You might not see him again, maybe for a while, maybe never. I keep socks, bottled water, a blanket and some small food items in my car so I can hand them out on the spot if I meet someone who needs them. Its tough connecting with people a second time who have no address or phone, maybe no watch.   Glad to hear you are helping. I hope you meet up with the guy again.
eyaf93,,fgisllp,Good advice and I was concerned about overloading him. I really hope I see him again too. He‚Äôs by the freeway every day so it makes me nervous that I didn‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm gonna keep his care pack for him for another week or so and then do the same, give it to someone else. I can always make him another one if I see him again.
eyaf93,fgh6tnx,,Money...
eyaf93,fghbl15,,A bus pass.  Here in Vegas many homeless ride the bus to get out of the elements.
eyaf93,fghe46p,,I like your idea, never been to Seattle but since it‚Äôs up north I‚Äôd assume around this time a good hat and pair of gloves.  As far as food goes I‚Äôd skip the care package and just give them cash, if they are hungry they can eat what they want. Toiletry items like socks and toothpaste work out and also toothbrushes and backpacks full of camping and survival supplies like a portable stove or a water filter for drinking out of lakes or ponds. Compass, matches, MRE. Stuff like that. But if your in a pinch cash is always the way to go, try giving paper money and not change. Just my opinion.
eyaf93,fggvlen,,It is nice what u doing. But why post it for. Do u want w cookie or something?

eyaf93,,fggyfke,It is also great ideas for others.  I have talked about doing the same and now I have some concrete suggestions from people who need it.
eyaf93,,fgh4g2n,Well done! By the way, how about a bag of cookies? Maybe a couple of candy bars? I know washing clothes with a big thing for me so maybe a $20 gift card that can be used at the laundromat. I know a lot of coin operated laundry takes credit cards now. I was given a gift card for Subway and it was the only way I was able to eat for a few days! Very much appreciated!
eyaf93,,fgh4n4j,Coins for laundry! Awesome idea. I had thought of putting some sour patch kids in a baggie for him and now I will. Thanks for the suggestions!

eyh3a6,fgha4h5,,You sound like my cats.  They pay no rent, they don't work, and they complain that they don't have the finest food.  If we go out, they complain about that too.  When they accidentally get locked out, they complain that they have been deprived of all their freebies, and they want to come back in immediately.  &#x200B;  If you go someplace else, I predict that your problems will go with you.  Plus, you will have the additional problem of making rent.    Fix whatever needs to be fixed so that you can get a job in your own town.  Then consider moving someplace else.
eyh3a6,,fgheeor,Thanks for saving me the time of writing basically the same thing.  FFS.
eyh3a6,,fgi1zfi,Fair analogy, but I revealed only a small glimpse of my world, I think you have to be in my shoes to really empathize. I am in a rural area of a rich 'diverse' town that is biased against me (Low status white male). Rent in other areas can be as low as $300 a month, it won't be much of a problem. Here it is $900+
eyh3a6,fghlv2d,,I would work with a local job center and establish some work history before moving. Then, I'd see if there are services or a therapist who can help you work on skills needed to navigate the outside world. There are many places to  call home. The world is your oyster.  But you need to understand yourself first...strengths, growth areas, hopes and dreams.
eyh3a6,,fgi0qpp,I had a therapist and she wasn't any help. I saw a doctor too who was even worse...He just wanted to prescribe me medication (Prozac) as if some pill is going to solve everything.   Neither directed me to any job center, I don't even think there is one here since jobs are such a commodity and there is no shortage of employees...
eyh3a6,fghcd6c,,> Ideally there should be some sort of half-way homes with job assistance I could network with    Can't speak for the halfway house (and afaik you wouldn't quality anyway, are you on parole?) but 'job assistance' doesn't exist anywhere.  Why?  It costs money and you'd be taking an opportunity away from someone who 'worked harder'.  All these 'career centers' do is plop you in front of a pc.  If you can use a search engine just stay home.
eyh3a6,,fgi1oqn,Yes, exactly-- It's as if I would have a better chance if I was a criminal with a case manager to find me housing and job assistance!   It's like all the technology has made it even harder to find a job... We have to make an account, sign in, take 30 minute personality tests...etc...again and again. And be better than the other 500 applicants and for the lowest pay.

eyh3a6,fgrzvlh,,If you're willing to work 7 days a week and don't mind travel, I can recommend carnival work. It's very tough during teardown and setting up every week, but pretty easy during fairs. You make a weekly salary and have no rent costs, and oftentimes make extra if you can drive loads between locations.  If you'd like more information, PM me. It's how I went from the streets in Florida to working in Texas/Midwest.
eyh3a6,fghr52n,,Cool works. Com  You should get a job locally and buy your own food. Once you have an income you can get a WiFi extender.   Get into photoshop or Gimp and put your art skills to work. Can you draw caricatures? Try working fairs and carnivals.   Do you have a driver‚Äôs license? Do you own a car or van? Those would be good short term goals.
eyh3a6,,fgi0gvo,I will check out the website, but I am kind of burned out on art, especially depending on it for a living. I do have a drivers license, but I sold my car when my insurance was due since I was just wasting money driving to job interviews for a year. No one wants to hire me in this area. Also the car money went to paying off school and buying a laptop. I now have about $200 from saved up Christmas/birthdays...  **Edit This would actually be perfect if I could get hired by some sort of YMCA or any other live in type of position. I will be spamming them tomorrow, Thanks!

eyh3a6,fgiw4sk,,You did tattoos? Cool. Just do those again. Problem solved. Sometimes we have to do shit we don't like, but that's one thing that pays well, is a pretty cool job, and you won't end up on the street when they kick that bucket. Not for nothing, but you got it kinda easy I comparison to a lot of us on here and you're not really in danger of going homeless.
eyh3a6,,fgjjmfl,Ya it was cool in it's prime but it doesn't really pay well unless you own the shop and get a cut of all your employees... Or if you are a prodigy with a waiting list. Otherwise you might just be waiting around and not get paid anything all day...It might even be less than minimum wage. Not to mention you have competition with co-workers who are often dick's...Owners want to have multiple people on hand because they don't pay them hourly. If I was a prodigy I would absolutely, but my skill's seemed to plateau... And I am stigmatized from any other job now.
eyh3a6,,fgjqp7e,In that context, maybe I misjudged your situation. It's pretty shitty (not judging you, most of us here are going thru or went thru pretty shitty sitches). You might need to start out at a temp agency just to get your job skills up to par. At 38, with a minimal job skill set other than tattooing, it may seem like a steep climb up a shit heap, but do this. Breathe in, then breathe out. If you were able to do that, you can fix any problems you might be having. And another thing, don't down yourself and call yourself low IQ.
eyh3a6,,fgka0n3,Thanks, yes - It is uphill indeed, especially in a time and place that is so competitive for the most menial job. I failed to compile my new resume today, it is a huge effort when I have nothing to say on it. But damn - tomorrow is the day! I will try and copy a premade and change it around I guess.  I am low IQ though, I have come to accept it. Throughout my childhood my parents always brought me to psychologists or whatever to find out whats 'wrong with me'. They were all incompetent though unable to diagnose anything other than ADD. I graduated from a alternative highschool and even then I was late and they were being generous (My graduation was literally at my house)... My whole life I felt like a sociopath trying to act normal. I am a bad actor though so job interviews are especially hard.  Hopefully I can land some on location job somewhere else though, I do feel like my location plays a part. Especially competing with all the immigrants...It's as if speaking Spanish is mandatory if you work for a temp agency... Unless it is a office which is always reserved for women... But ya, hopefully I can turn things around this decade.
eyh3a6,,fgkbk7o,I live in Florida, so I definitely understand what it's like to apply for certain jobs knowing that speaking Spanish gets you in the door faster than actually being good at the job. Also, immigrants usually tend to be happier with whatever pay is offered and deal with their bosses' bullshit better than white, black and native Americans. Supervisors have actually discussed this within earshot of me before so it's not an anti-immigrant thing with me, it's just what I've experienced and saw.
eyh3a6,,fgkdta2,Absolutely.   I saw a documentary about Florida on RT (following the life of a single mother) Basically juggled 3 fast food jobs serving happy Disney World customers... And I hear Disney World doesn't pay all that much either. The grind is real.   Hope your supervisors aren't too hard on you...And watch out for Florida Man lol.

exx9zd,,fgepv0i,Yep. Only use my tent when it rains. Other than that, pack light. Use the backpack as a pillow. I've been jacked by other homeless more than the cops have messed with me.
exx9zd,,fge3ais,The people in mansions have already stolen more from you than you know
exx9zd,,fgfdgmx,In fact the only thing left for them to steal is tents. Tents = no rents.
exx9zd,,fge42k2,Indeed. The most important thing they have stolen from me is the full range of possibilites my life could have taken.

exx9zd,fgf3l8c,,I completely agree with everything the poster says but the wording is so pretentious that if I came across it I'd consider ripping it down
exx9zd,fge5ytj,,I remember when I was homeless people cut my tent several times, sole my shit, spread it everywhere. So fucking frustrating. I'm so glad I was able to figure out how to get clean and sober so I could remove myself from that situation and get back into a stable environment
exx9zd,,fgfqti3,See, "could remove myself from that situation" and  "[‚Ä¶]and get back into a stable environment" suggests you:  1. had resources, and  2. had help.  How did you manage it?  Please, share your story.  Because a large number of homeless don't have issues with drugs or alcohol (and very often if they do, they didn't start out with them), so "clean and sober" isn't the pathway to being housed that you seem to suggest that it might be.
exx9zd,,fgfu56d,Alcohol was my primary issue, one night being drunk and stumbling to my camp I tripped and hurt myself. I decided that night I was done. I had a gym membership already, and was working part time. I kept working that job and got another one close enough to bike to. I was able to get a position as a driver which meant I got to bring the van "home" at night. I started sleeping in the van, going to AA meetings every day at this point. Started going to church, basically stuff that was wholesome and would fill my time so I wouldn't slip back into drinking. After five or six more months I was able to rent a room. I fucked up and had to go back to the van for another year but I was able to hold it together. Got another place, still working out, going to church, and to AA, finally got a sponsor, and that really helped. I'm still trying to dig my way out of where I was, and it's an endless struggle. I was super lucky to find a decent job, but yeah. That's how I did it
exx9zd,,fgfzvoz,I'm so proud of you! Addictions are monsters to win against. Happy that you're in a stable environment now :)
exx9zd,,fgg3g8g,Thanks. It's still a struggle. The Bay Area is expensive, and I don't have family, but my church community, and sponsor have really been a godsend to help me along the way
exx9zd,,fggfqpy,Church can be a great way to help keep sober and I'm glad it's helping you <3
exx9zd,fge5sum,,Thats. Cool if it is on a sidewalk i dont care. If it is infront of door steep u bet ur ass ill move it.
exx9zd,fgfg961,,Idk if it depends on area, but for the 2 years I was on the street, most of the homeless I met were lazy, on drugs or taking advantage of the system.
exx9zd,fgfroc6,,I like this post. What is going in in our country? We have people walking around with millions and billions of dollars sitting in their bank. That is fucked up, no one needs that much. What has happened to humanity? No one should have to live in a tent with no bathroom and no heat. Someday I hope the greedy pay for this with suffering beyond their imagination. I would like to put Donald Trump in a tent camp for the test of his life and honestly Bloomburg can fucking join him.

ex9vgk,fgb545m,,Seems like a lot of us have the shared experience around three years on the streets.
ex9vgk,fgb8mno,,That‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling. After 2 years of being homeless I was housed this passed November. No drug could ever give me that feeling that felt when I had a comfortable  bed to sleep on
ex9vgk,fgat50s,,Congratulations
ewe199,fg1li9x,,Hello to you too üòÅ.  Its easy to forget that we're all not helpless, bad people. Many of us have made poor life decisions, but not all. I don't drink and have never done drugs. Not even marijuana. Im sure I look scary to everyone with my long hair and beard. I'll be and look this way until I finally get my engineering degree and then hopefully I'll be able to afford haircuts. For the time being my girlfriend and I slaves to minimum wage.  I'm close though! Im 23 and will graduate in the fall! It feels good to let know that you're on my side! Thank you OP and god bless you and your loved ones!
ewe199,,fgrdv6b,Congrats! you must be so excited to be getting close!
ewe199,fg1efhj,,Thank you for this.
ewe199,fg2exvx,,While sleeping in my car other truck stop, I asked six different people if they can jump my car. None of them had jumper cables. They didn't even give me the opportunity to offer $10. Which was all I had but I was freezing my butt off and the only way to get warm was the turn the car on. I'm a 55 year old female and I'm not ugly and I'm not dirty. I don't drink or do drugs. These were not Truckers as I didn't want to ask them because they would have to move big trucks. I never felt so invisible. It took everything I had to ask for a jump in the first place and to be treated like I didn't exist really did a number to my psyche. I was finally able to get a couple that slept in their car to give me a jump. They were willing to do it for free but I gave them my last $10. They were so appreciative. Thank you for acknowledging us. There may be a percentage of not-so- stable homeless people but there are also a good portion of us that just had some bad things happen. Thank you again for being human.
ewe199,fg2blhk,,Thank you very much. I assure you, we **all** care about this. If everyone felt as you do there would likely not be a homeless crisis.
ewe199,fg1vnhb,,Hi from San Diego California and I am Homeless
ewe199,fg1wdu9,,Thanks needed to see this, it‚Äôs heartwarming.
ewe199,fg2dvlq,,Thank you! You might pass by some of us and not even realize that we are homeless. We might look just like you. There are a lot of us out there who make sure to make ourselves presentable for meetings, appointments, court appearances, and job interviews. I‚Äôm one of those people. I may not have eaten that day, but I don‚Äôt let it be known. I‚Äôm happy to talk to people about being homeless, and I talk with all different kinds of homeless people. I believe in dressing for the life you want and if you work hard enough you will get there.
ewe199,fg2gx7k,,I am no longer homeless, but I can say, we do see you as well, and your words are much appreciated. Being alone and having nothing, sometimes a simple, "hello," is enough to make ones day.  &#x200B;  So thank you.
ewe199,fg1qykd,,<3 <3 <3
ewe199,fg2qun9,,You're very kind.
ewe199,fg1fjej,,Thanks man. I always knew it could happen to anybody, that's why before it happened to me, I would treat homeless people, like people. Buy them food, talk to them, give them the shoes off my feet (usually because I had another pair or just bought some) just do the little things because I also am empathetic. I know eventually that good karma will come back on me, so I'm keeping my head up as much as possible. Keep being you üíØ
ewe199,fg2yyt4,,I was going to say, "fuck you, you don't know me how can you love me?"  But actually often those simple smiles and acknowledgements mean a lot.... So thanks
ewe199,fg3czos,,I have always I say hi to Everyone who is Homeless in San Diego, California
ewe199,fg1we1j,,Why not go farther I challenge and get to really know one of them through time. You will learn so much about yourself. Love until it hurts you.
evc9o1,ffuxbav,,Fuck YES!!! Very happy for y'all. Safety and comfort is a wonderful thing.

evc9o1,ffw6n1b,,Wow! I‚Äôm so happy for you! You are an inspiration to the rest of us who are still homeless, but are working our butts off to get where you are! Congratulations!
evc9o1,,ffx4ba3,Thank you , sometimes it was so hard to remember that the situation wasn't forever and that my efforts were building me towards something. I hope my story reminds everybody else that their efforts mean something.
evc9o1,,ffy164q,It definitely reminded me! I‚Äôm going through Family Court to regain custody of my daughter all while dealing with being homeless. I have to go to endless appointments every day, walking in the freezing cold. It‚Äôs so much work, but I‚Äôm constantly reminding myself that I am doing it all to create a better life for my daughter and I. It‚Äôs easy to get discouraged with the amount of stuff required, but success stories like yours prove that there is light at the end of the tunnel.   I have been blessed with a new friend who is very supportive and encouraging. I needed to have someone like this in my life as I have had to cut ties with pretty much everyone that was in my life before because they were so toxic. I had one friend that I was very close to and he was helping me out financially by finding me odd jobs. The only problem was that he was very negative about everything, especially my situation. He told me that I was going to stay in the shelter forever and that I would never get my daughter back. He complained about work and the fact that I have a curfew at the shelter and couldn‚Äôt spend the night with him. After my DV attack I haven‚Äôt been comfortable staying with a man overnight anyway. He was being selfish and just kept getting angry with me for not spending enough time with him. I am focused on my daughter and myself, so I had to cut ties with him because he was so toxic. Thankfully, after I cut him out of my life I ran into a friend I had met recently and he has been extremely supportive and encouraging. I‚Äôm thankful for finding him. Neither one of us have any money and I‚Äôve never been happier. I think he is the friend I need to help me get through this difficult situation.
evc9o1,,ffzsg67,I'm glad you found the inner stregnth to leave someone toxic while already facing so much, I'm even more glad for you having a companion who can appreciate you for who you are. Your daughter has a ferice mother to look up to :) . I thought my daughters would be disappointed in me for being homeless in the first place but all they hold in their hearts is pride and joy that we overcame it. I'll wish the best for you. Hold fast and keep fighting.
evc9o1,,ffzwl32,Thank you so much! I really thrive off encouragement and my family is so disappointed in me it‚Äôs nice to hear kind words from anyone.  They are very religious and believe I should have stayed with my abuser for my daughter even though we were both being abused. I know I am doing the right thing for both of us. I only pray I get her back soon.
evc9o1,,ffzxfgl,Corinthians 3:16 -3:17   16: "do you not know your the temple of god, and that the spirit of god dwells with in you?"  17: If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which a temple you are  Your family needs to read up on their bibles if that's their excuse for allowing someone to harm you.
evc9o1,,fg12kgi,I know they are hypocrites, but in their minds they know all and are always right even when they are wrong. They accuse me of not being a good Christian, but I read my Bible, pray everyday, and go to church. They don‚Äôt practice what they preach.
evc9o1,ffvhayx,,Congrats!
evc9o1,ffvmjdf,,Congratulations! This is awesome!
ev3ty2,fft67qg,,Do you have a solid ability to get food for said pet? If yeah then I say go for it. People seem to talk alot of shit to the people with dogs in my city, but still give them food for the dog often. A mouse is definitely different but I've never been a huge fan of them, unless my snake wanted a fresh boi
ev3ty2,fftk22a,,If you dressed that little mouse up like a hobo you would be a hit.
ev3ty2,ffwnfda,,Just my opinion as a fellow homeless. I dont have anything fancy like a car though. If I cant yet provide myself with a stable life its not fair to an animal either. Unless you fond a lovable stray cat. Then I dunno befriend it and teach it to ride on your shoulder like a pirates bird or something. Im losing my mind in this shelter...
ev3ty2,ffyqkxk,,I suggest a rat, theyre bigger and generally friendlier then mice. Their diets are mostly human compatible and they can learn their names and such.
ev2dbi,ffwjwbt,,Dont do it. Im 35 and never made anything of my life. The last few years have fallen to alcoholism and untreated depression. The reality of being homeless is nowhere near the romantic ideas of doing what you want when you want. If anything ypur severely more limited than if you were to get a job and get your own place. Theres far better things in life than drinking in the street hoping not to be arrested. The world is also not the kind loving place you dream it to be. People will be out to use you however they can. So yes it is crazy. Why anyone would choose this life is beyond me. Am in a shelter currently hopelessly lost on how to get my life together. Dont be like me.
ev2dbi,ffthnzr,,My initial reaction was anger, as I couldn't see anyone wanting to be homeless. I sleep in my car every night at a local walmart. I'm afraid of getting caught because it's illegal to do that in my state. I worry about not having money to eat. I'm also in college and can't afford my tuition. My situation is bad. I don't think I could ever understand someone wanting to be homeless. I have to spend money on a gym membership solely so that I have access to a shower. I don't like not having the freedom to stretch out in bed, or use the bathroom whenever I please. If that's what you want, I can respect that. I just can't understand it.
ev2dbi,ffu3ryr,,Wtf
ev2dbi,ffszdab,,Not crazy at all, many are happy that way just as I am
ev2dbi,fftow7v,,I always thought when I was homeless the best part was not having to pay bills like rent and utilities...just needed money for food,beer etc...if I had some money in my pocket it made things much better like if I wanted to see a movie or hang out at a bar

ev2dbi,ffw9cb0,,yes
ev2dbi,ffwv4jv,,Well the thing about doing whatever you want or sleeping whenever you want sounds great. No bills? Even greater. Then you realize... Everything you do out here gets criminalized, even sleeping. You gotta watch out for sleeping in parking lots, the woods, parks, anywhere except rest/truck stops has some degree of getting caught and told to leave or arrested. I always treated homeless people with kindness and respect because I knew that at any given time it could be me, and that they more than likely don't wanna be homeless. And I'm gonna kindly tell you that it sucks being without a home.

eujg1x,ffpxl4q,,Hope you are comfortable.  Doesn't look like a bad view.  (Not to downplay your plight, though)
eujg1x,ffqefe1,,Had a similar setup myself until yesterday, had to pack up the camp after the city came through and mowed right up to my little stand of trees
eujg1x,,ffqmjxg,Three months ago I woke up to bull dozers dozing down the woods. I had everything packed and ready to go in about half an hour. I really felt sorry for the squirrels and birds that were losing their homes. They acted like refugees, it was more a shock to them than to me. I left town on my bike and found some new woods later that day. I pull my dog with a bicycle trailer that also has all my gear. I go to a different town once a week anyways. I always stay on the move.
eujg1x,,ffrc5hl,I live in suburban northern NJ and man, they just keep developing every patch of woods in my area to overpopulate the state with condo/townhouse developments that attract idiotic residents. It's hard to get lost in the woods in NJ, but there are some decent hiking areas. It's hard to live in the woods of NJ. Sleeping on the streets of NJ's urban areas are dangerous. You need a car in NJ to sleep in and park at some random office building where cops would never find you.  I love animals and I always feel bad for the animals that live in the woods.
eujg1x,,ffygdpe,a bear in nj, 30 miles south of manhattan caught and ate a hindu exchange student a couple years ago
eujg1x,,ffqgskk,Setting up with the idea that you're going to move soon is best. That way it's a small inconvenience moving on, rather than a complete disruption to your life. I generally wouldn't stay in one place more than a few days as that's when you start drawing unwanted attention.
eujg1x,,ffquqgd,Definitely, me and my buddy were well aware when we set up that we'd have to move soon, and had it planned, unfortunately we did get a bit too comfortable and had more than one trip worth of stuff there, but it was simple enough to pack it all up and take it out
eujg1x,ffqkq4u,,damn bro. looks like a relatively northern area. How you keeping warm?
eujg1x,,ffqlnhi,It's in Georgia. And I got a pocket full of hot hands hand warmers.
eujg1x,,ffqlwft,not too bad. georgia land is pretty cheap... you ever look into buying an acre somewhere and just puttin up a shed?
eujg1x,,ffr8ew4,In my experience if I own something worth taking it will just get taken.
eujg1x,,ffr8nqt,I used to have the same attitude. In my case, it's a result of mental health issues. I am on the autism spectrum, and sometimes I have depressive meltdowns that last 2 weeks or months. Those not only cost me my jobs, but they also cost relationships and eventually I and left all assed out. I think the solution here is to keep things small and affordable. Owning instead of renting gives you a lot of added rights. They can just evict you with one month's notice. If you buy small enough, just one or two acres oh, you have enough to live on without anyone bothering you, and you will have some area to grow food if you want to. Maybe keep chickens. Regardless, it will not cost much to keep.
eujg1x,,ffr9msp,It would take me a long time to panhandle that much money lol.
eujg1x,,ffr9uem,If that's the only source of income, true. My ideal setup would be to find someone with a farm or lot of land that would let me camp out for free in return for some work or something... This would be ideal
eujg1x,,ffquifh,Are you anywhere near the Blue Ridge mountains? I lived in north Georgia for couple years in a log cabin. Beautiful there.
eujg1x,,ffr8b5q,I'm near Douglasville right now. I'm thinking about going to South Carolina soon though.
eujg1x,,ffrinqx,You are about an hour south of where I first lived in Cartersville. Then I moved even further north to my boyfriend's at the time cabin. Always saw a lot of logging trucks. Yeah, South Carolina might be warmer.
eujg1x,ffqpaxf,,If you really think about it we live more in accordance with nature than most...we should inherit the earth. We are free and they hate us for it. We are kind when we should be screaming at those that despoil our land. And that land is divided and sold by the rich. Live like your already free.  https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/why-youve-never-heard-of-charter-thats-as-important-as-magna-carta/  https://chomsky.info/20150323/
eujg1x,ffwnpnj,,Its generally not so romantic folks dont be fooled by some pretty picture. It sucks and its a desperate struggle every day.
eujg1x,,fg0ovwq,The best advice I can give is to be happy no matter what your situation is. If you're depressed all the time about being on the streets, you will get yourself into a feedback loop of negativity. Once you're in that state you will find it ALOT harder to improve your situation. Always remind yourself that the only way from the bottom is up. Even doing something small like getting a warmer sleeping bag instead of a bottle of booze will help you improve your situation and raise your morale. Remember that you control your own happiness and create your own reality.
eujg1x,ffq241i,,Looks like your living the dream to me!
eujg1x,,ffqm0e7,I try to.
eujg1x,ffqmsbr,,Homelessness, to me, means not having my own space... that everywhere I lay down is someone's place and I'm not welcome there... I prefer buying a place but rent is ok too
eujg1x,,ffqqtkx,America land of the free. Except no land is free anymore. Either private or gubment controlled , the signs read: No trespassing, no camping , closed after dark.  Didn't we know, the world is 'closed after dark'.
eujg1x,,ffr8vsh,That's why camouflage is a must. If people don't know you're there because you're effectively invisible then many lands become free.
eujg1x,,ffrgyp0,Until they find you. Here they patrol the tracks at night with Blazers, spotlights and dogs, writing tickets for criminal sleeping.
eujg1x,,ffs049t,That's why I try to go outside of town to do this. I don't like being in major cities either. I always start tracking to see what kind of human activity has happened in the last year. If it doesn't meet up to my requirements I might sleep there anyway but I'm out at dawn.
eujg1x,,fft7iug,I used to hate that. Striking camp at first light to stay below the radar. Sometimes a 'spot' is that tenuous.  I used to live in my truck with a camper shell, go round at night diving in dumpsters. Sometimes I would just park inconspicuous in a company parking lot that ran shifts 24/7. I would sort of park and sit there a bit and, when it was quiet, duck into the back and go to sleep. Then rise up when the shift changed and leave, sometimes to strange stares but mostly let alone.  Until they see you one time too many. Trying to divide that line of tolerance between ignoring me (for now) to calling the cops w/o being too embarrassed.
eujg1x,,ffyh2rr,i stole burlap off a landscaping project then spent a hour r so decorating it with mud, twigs and leaves. now my tent is in   the backyard of Interview With the Vampire lady and she doesnt suspect a thing lol  #ArmyShit
eujg1x,,fg0o3rb,That's badass dude. I have often thought of settling in one area someday, and digging an underground lair. It would be warm in the winter and cool in the summer. But I don't wanna invest that kinda time and resources on something I would only use for a week or so.
eujg1x,,fg6l3y9,yeah.  ive admired bunker builders for years.  if you look in the arcata paper some dudes built one thats absolutely awesome :)
eujg1x,,fg6la4q,my goal is to build a treehouse or similar setup somewhere fancy, like central park... right under their noses ;)
eujg1x,,ffqqz72,I'm hoping to have myself a bit of land soon
eujg1x,fg0yori,,I'm about to be in a similar situation, I've tried reaching out and taking prevention measures but there are so many stipulations and resources are too far to travel by foot. I'm 24 f, and am going to be on the streets tommorrow. Not many wooded areas, shelters are 45 minute drive and are all full. No friends no family, no tent. Cant afford a motel.  I have $150 to my name untill two weeks, and was going to use that for a tent. I wanted to ask you OP if you have any tips on staying warm and safe during the night, and what supplies I should have on hand if i can get them easily to help me through. Without shelter tomorrow, in pa.
eujg1x,,fg0yvkg,I should also mention that I could get a motel stay for a few nights with the $150 but that would leave me with no funds for food, or safety during the nights I have no shelter.
eujg1x,,fiyosuu,ghostmob550  &#x200B;  I wrote a reply with some helpful info to someone going through a similar situation:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/f60a2j/biking\_and\_staying\_warm/fi8282n/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/f60a2j/biking_and_staying_warm/fi8282n/)  &#x200B;  Hope this is a helpful start.
eugpct,ffpcy40,,Damn. Thats a bit much. In my city bed check is at 10pm, then lights out, though we usually turned them off earlier, then breakfast buzzer rings at 6:30. Though if you want to skip breakfast you can sleep til 8am when they kick everyone out. Do you know their logic behind the 6am boot? Doesnt really make sense.
eugpct,,ffpdcxk,I suspect it‚Äôs because 6:10 is the first let out (which I use because if I can‚Äôt sleep I‚Äôm going to work), and the 6:10 let out is also when all the drug court girls leave. Sometimes I wonder if we just all have to get up because that‚Äôs when they have to get up.
eugpct,,ffpdukt,What do you mean "let out"? They dont let you leave? At our shelters you can leave whenever you want.
eugpct,,ffpfep1,You can leave whenever you want, like they can‚Äôt hold you against your will, but demanding to leave at a time outside the let out hours would probably result in some sort of punishment because a staff member needs to stop whatever they are doing and get your bags and cell phone and stuff to give back to you. There are a lot of let out slots though. I‚Äôve never seen anyone try to leave at a different time.
eugpct,,ffpir9c,they take your phone away?
eugpct,,ffpjx2m,They take your stuff? Thats weird. Our shelters have lockers next to the beds.
eugpct,,ffqmi7u,Yeah, we aren‚Äôt allowed to have bags or boxes and they have you empty your pockets and shake out your bra and socks/shoes. You have a tub at your bed you can keep the allowed stuff in. They‚Äôll also store your valuables for you.  I‚Äôd rather have a lot of dumb rules than none. I don‚Äôt want to get stabbed or have to use the shower after someone just tried smoking pot in it.
eugpct,,ffr8zrz,Agreed. Sounds like your situation isnt as bad when you look at it from that perspective.
eugpct,,ffqn99c,The other shelter in town has no rules and it‚Äôs a mess. I hear horrible stories about people getting attacked or screamed at. They have bed bugs and one of the (former) staff members plead guilty to sexually assaulting a woman who was staying there.
eugpct,,ffr8xbc,Ya, true enough. Ours isnt quite that bad, but its rough. You have to be vigilant.
eugpct,,ffq7243,Wtf is this place
eugpct,,ffrfg3a,Here you can leave before 530am kick out, but you can't come back and lose your bed. You can collect belongings, and have access to them from 9am to noon Mon, Wed, Fri.  You become level 2 after 30 days and gain a small locker. Everybody does chores twice a week, regardless of work.  Bedbugs and the runs are part of acclimation.
eugpct,,ffpffrb,I think it sometimes has to do with the length of employees shifts, cleaning schedules, and if the space is utilized around the clock.   I think it also has to do with societal biases, probably more than just logistics. No one wants it to be easy to be homeless because there's the commonly accepted notion that poverty is based in laziness, so why would they let people "sleep in"? Non profits do a better job of humanising folks than city run outfits and often churches.  I don't think anyone is really keeping up with the new social and economic realities of homelessness though, the world has changed in some ways.
eugpct,,ffpejms,Almost certainly.
eugpct,ffp9pfz,,That's why I would rather sleep in the woods, I sometimes don't wake up until noon lol.
eugpct,ffph8it,,Shit, that's why I slept all summer in a tent last year, in Texas. Empty residential lot, nice clearing surrounded by a ring of trees. Was balls hot, but got like 10 hours of sleep daily, and if it was too hot, I could just take off my clothes.
eugpct,ffpb8dx,,I worked at a shelter for victims of domestic violence. I feel the same way you do. Our residents were required to out of their rooms by 7:30 am.
eugpct,,ffpch81,I know why homeless shelters do this but why did a DV shelter?
eugpct,ffq5nvi,,I thought lights out was a bit late. If there are common areas, I would think lights out can be earlier and those who want to turn in can.
eugpct,ffq6mxx,,It would be ideal of everyone got at least 8 hours of sleep per night. With my new job, I've been sleeping an average of 5 hours a night and my mental health is definitely taking a toll
eugpct,ffpgd9c,,Our residents had to be involved in counseling and parenting classes. There were groups they had to attend for various things,   This was only during the week days. On the weekend you did what you wanted (unless you had children then you were expected to be with them breakfast at 8:30 am)
eugpct,ffqcs7t,,This is silly and seems like making people get up at an unreasonable hour just for the sake of The Rules.
eugpct,ffwo2ao,,Just kinda gotta roll with it bud. It may suck but hopefully it doesnt have to be forever and its better than the alternative.
eugpct,,ffwzq26,Yeah I know. I only have to deal with it until Friday though so at least I‚Äôll get sleep soon!  Literally the night I posted this I was woken up by staff and told I had a night chore now (I‚Äôve only had earlier chores) and that I had to go to the main building and do dishes. The chore is supposed to be done at 9, with us theoretically being able to be in bed by 9:30, but my partner for the chore doesn‚Äôt get in until 9:30, she has to eat dinner, and THEN we get to go do the dishes. I have to do my shower after I get back and we need to wait for a staff member to let us back, so I haven‚Äôt been able to get to bed until after 11 since then.
eugpct,,ffx5g83,Roll with the punches friday will be here soon. I wish you luck. Be safe out there.
ettxhp,ffivlu9,,I agree with you. The last line is the worst part, too. People mean well when they say/post things like this, but it's not really as positive as they believe.
ettxhp,ffir053,,I hate poverty porn or posts mocking people for things they can't help. I dgaf who wants to be "inspired" by it. It's dehumanizing to be treated like a prop.
ettxhp,,ffiw6lz,Exactly. It's like when I lived in an organized homeless camp, and we had to allow *tours* of all the stupid things to do. These people, mostly from churches, would literally look at us like zoo animals, and talk to their children about us, right in front of us.
ettxhp,,ffiwwln,Shelters do this too. It's ridiculous.
ettxhp,,ffjb8nn,Apparently this man finds his personal story inspiring, which is why he said what he did about not having a reason to frown to who ever made this post.
ettxhp,ffj1q6j,,When I was watching my best friend's son die from cancer there were sick bastards wanting to use "our story" in fundraisers... fuck that shit
ettxhp,ffj8nyx,,It's wrong, but so is the majority of "normal" people's behavior with the homeless. I think this sort of thing is at least an attempt at a positive influence on others, but the poster lacks a level of compassion to understand that he/she is objectifying another human being by making them a spectacle on their social media feed.
ettxhp,ffikkql,,You don't own your own image, and you can't keep other people from talking about you.  Expecting otherwise is a road to frustration and insanity.  Whether you are homeless and struggling to get breakfast at Starbucks, or an Olympic competitor born with a deformity, or a fatherless child born into poverty who becomes president, if you raise yourself up, people are going to be inspired by it.  We are not born with the innate knowledge we need to survive and prosper.  We learn from the examples of others.
ettxhp,,ffizrzl,I‚Äôm not sure I understand this comment. You can feel inspired by homeless people all you want, but exploiting them for likes on a social media platform, while at the same time demeaning homeless people who are not convenient to you is not okay. I totally agree that people who post this stuff mean well, but it‚Äôs condescending and very patronizing when people do this.
ettxhp,,ffily91,Regardless of whether you own your image it‚Äôs in poor taste to take unsolicited pics of someone and post them on the internet. I think we should expect better from each other and call folks out for this behavior.
ettxhp,,ffio8a6,Agreed. Well said. People on Reddit are very mean toward the homeless.
ettxhp,,ffipc4k,It‚Äôs so depressing reading the upvoted top level comments in every thread about homeless people in my local city‚Äôs subreddit. They literally just complain about them existing.
ettxhp,,ffipncj,I don't understand it. How can people be so mean?
ettxhp,,ffipyp7,In my city‚Äôs case there‚Äôs been a huge influx of tech folks with money as well as a huge growth in the homeless population. I know a lot of people in tech who aren‚Äôt jerks but so many of them are insulated from any hardships that they think if someone is homeless it‚Äôs because they are lazy and useless. I think that this callous mindset helps them make sense of their own prosperity without feeling guilty.
ettxhp,,ffiqhga,Seattle or San Francisco?
ettxhp,,ffiuf30,Neither
ettxhp,,ffiwu03,There's too many cities like this!
ettxhp,,ffqj9d1,to be fair most homeless are lazy, useless, drug addicted, or have some sort of severe mental problem.
ettxhp,,ffiqm8b,have you MET paparazzi?  What you just described is an entire career.
ettxhp,,ffiv1zl,People do shitty things for money? Tell me more!
ettxhp,,ffir73t,>You don't own your own image,  This is legallly false. You do own your own image, it is called the right to publicity. What is happening in this situation is a legal grey area. I think this photo is ethically wrong.
ettxhp,,ffj5155,It depends on the laws of your Country.  In the USA, if you are in a public place, anyone can take your picture without permission.
ettxhp,,ffjlk69,The righ of publicity in the usa is about desemination, not production.
ettxhp,,ffjsopw,I've been homeless and lived out of dumpsters for a number of years. This is just something that we just have to accept. You still have a First Amendment to express whatever views you want about it, including calling them A**holes.  There's a reason the paparazzi is a legal thing. The way most states protect the Right of Publicity is indirect by way of the Right of Privacy. A Right of Privacy is then predicated on the legal term of art "reasonable expectation of privacy." An individual in the public, or in full view of the public do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. This is why the plain view doctrine allows cops to use what they can see in plain view against you in court. Because by virtue of being in plain view of the public, the cops in this case, without trespassing to get that view there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. The same applies to taking pictures of people in public. No reasonable expectation of privacy means they are free to take your picture and discriminate it as they see fit.   Some states protect the Right of Publicity through the law of unfair competition. But this applies to commerce (injury to a business) where it's used in a manner to falsely imply either an endorsement of a product or the source of the product being offered. So long as the images of you taken in public aren't used to falsely imply your personal endorsement, or imply that the instrument of commerce is being offered by you, then there is no cause of action to sue for a violation of your Right to Publicity.   You do not not own the Right to Publicity of the photo itself because the copyright of the photo goes to the person who actually took that photo. They own the Right to Publicity of the photo itself, because they own the copyright on it. The same way the paparazzi owns the copyright, and therefore the Right to Publicity of any photos they take of celebrities in public, or in plain view of the public.
ettxhp,,ffjp4eb,Can't disseminate it if you can't produce it.  In the USA if you are in a public place, or anywhere there is no reasonable guarantee of privacy, anyone has the right to take your picture without permission and they don't need your permission to post it anywhere. They do need permission to use it for commercial purposes, though.
ettxhp,,ffk16ew,>and they don't need your permission to post it anywhere.  Catagorically false. The obvious example that disproves your statement is revenge porn. The right to publicity is a complicated area of law.
ettxhp,,ffk30hl,No, that's a specific instance.   If I take a picture of you in a park or shopping mall and post it online, it's totally legal because you have no reasonable expectation of privicy when you are in public. At least in the USA that is.  But if the intent of posting such pictures is out of malice and to harm another, then it can be illegal (depending on the situation).
ettxhp,,ffiqu9n,Stop telling ACTUAL HOMELESS PEOPLE how they should feel. You are not homeless, have not been homeless and you don't even believe homelessness is connected to housing costs!
ettxhp,,ffqtt44,>Stop telling ACTUAL HOMELESS PEOPLE how they should feel...  I wrote about beliefs/expectations, not feelings.  I did not say what the OP should feel, I suggested that they discard a belief/expectation.  It is the same idea as "...the wisdom to know the difference"  >You are not homeless...  True.  >...have not been homeless...  False.  Please knock off the ad hominem attacks.  If you disagree with something that I write, address the words themselves.
ettxhp,,ffqwxqr,You aren't used to being disagreed with, are you?
ettxhp,,ffiqfng,What a gross view. You absolutely SHOULD be able to control who uses your image and what they use it for. And this specific example used by the OP isn't "inspirational" , it's mocking.
ettxhp,,ffiqqki,Hey, are you talking about someone else without their permission?
ettxhp,,ffim7ap,Beautiful comment!
ettxhp,,ffiqqg4,Hey, are you talking about someone else without their permission?
ettxhp,ffirkee,,OP, i agree that this is wrong. But that is what the powerful do, they exploit the powerless. More at 11.

et4rze,,fffbxs0,Hey you're an awesome person. Don't know what prompted you to do it but whatever it is thank God its there
et4rze,,ffggnuv,A couple of things. I knew a kid who was in a band, he got into drugs and was homeless. Kind of weird when you start getting in the mind set that, couch surfing, to occasional sleeping outside, can still be homeless. Dude just couldn‚Äôt get ahead. Couldn‚Äôt stop paying his fines. Couldn‚Äôt get enough money for a down payment on an apt. Couldn‚Äôt get an apt with his credit. His mom abandoned him after the 2nd time she had to use narcan. None of his friends were real friends, and the ones that were, left after he kept relapsing.  So, if I can provide someone just some sort of relief in the shitty perpetual nature of never being able to get ahead. I will. Also, by taking those step forwards, you‚Äôre helping your community at large. You have another contributing member of society that‚Äôll put in a hand when needed. Buy their goods from a local business, etc.
et4rze,,ffh07m7,Needed to hear this. Thanks friend.
et4rze,,ffhcq6i,I‚Äôm not sure what part. But I‚Äôm glad I can help.   I wish I could be rainbows and butterflies and say it‚Äôs because ‚Äúno one deserves to be cold‚Äù. But honestly, I want to solve core root issues, and give people a chance. I want to give society a chance. I want to believe in the system of feeding the economy and community by people who help.

et4rze,,fff4rvc,Northside Community Food Pantry would be an excellent spot.

et4rze,,ffhff8k,I‚Äôll check it out! Sherman recommenced the red door, 1030-1130 M-Sat. I was Going to check that out
et4rze,ffef7zi,,You are a quality human. I was just in San Diego for a few days where the number of homeless is unfathomable. I was reminded by so many limping around about the trench-foot problem. Socks are imperative, but it's so tough to do laundry. You might consider throwing some tough-actin Tinactin in there. Ima go back through there in a few weeks and I ordered a big box of it so I can hang out with them and offer something else besides an ear (which they also desperately need).
et4rze,,ffgcl6q,That‚Äôs really smart and thoughtful of you. I sat down with a man today named Sherman for a half hour on my lunch. Some people do just need to talk
et4rze,,ffh41or,I think talking and offering respect is the absolute most important thing. It's tough though to hear the heartbreaking stories. I heard so many in s.d. that I put myself to sleep with tears more than once. I am so fortunate.

et4rze,ffeatfz,,You should cross post this in r/vagabond !!
et4rze,,ffedi4l,Just did ! Thanks
et4rze,ffehfyf,,You‚Äôre so amazing thank you for doing this. How I wish I had run into somebody like you when I was homeless.  And I second the whole trench foot issue. Just a thought for future packages but heavier duty Marino wool socks are better than cotton because it will help not just weatherwise but help as far as taking care of sweat and breeding of athletes foot and that kind of thing. At least more than cotton socks. End it also helps regulate their body temperature a little bit better. Especially on cold weather like that because you lose heat so easy. Something I have to say I learned the hard way.  And may be a few beanies or tight fit  caps like you would wear when you‚Äôre skiing. I can‚Äôt think of the name of them right at the moment but that would also be helpful so that they can try to maintain what heat they have because you also lose a lot through your head.   If they don‚Äôt have a coat with a hood that they can put up then it can really be an issue. And also maybe gloves. Although that can be really problematic to deal with so can kind of be hit or miss and it seems to kind of be a personal choice.  Also maybe small packages of tide or something like that that you can buy to fly with, that kind of thing.   Because sometimes the only way you can get laundry done is if you have a sink somewhere and you can just throw in a little bit of the little package of detergent and do socks and underwear if you‚Äôre lucky. Or if you‚Äôre lucky enough to scrounge up enough change to be able to do a load of laundry.  Although I actually found liquid soap is easier and I accidentally discovered a company when I was homeless that makes Castile soap in liquid form also bar form but the liquid is really awesome as a laundry detergent and you can use it to wash your hair and your entire body as well so you can get a two in one going with that. And I know that they sell them in 2 ounce or 4 ounce bottles or something like that. I think the brand name is called Dr. Bonners. And anyway it‚Äôs soap that I still use even though it‚Äôs been about a decade since I was homeless.  Anyway just wanted to add this. List is by no means a criticism of what you‚Äôre doing. Just a suggestion and I thought maybe for future ideas.  Really amazing what you‚Äôre doing and thank you so so much. I wish that I had the income to be able to do something like this for my local homeless population.

errdtl,ff6freh,,what are the best strategies to stay safe when sleeping in your car? i tried this the other night but couldn't fall asleep because i was so paranoid someone would break into my car and try to harm me.
errdtl,,ff6xyzz,Depends on the kind of neighborhood you're in to a large extent. If you're in your car anyway, you may as well stay on the nicer end if town.   In a halfway-decent area, nothing's going to happen. The only reason someone would bother with your car is if they were trying to steal from it/ steal it;   typically when car thieves/ petty burglars stumble upon a body occupying their target car, they shit their pants and leave, I'd wager.  But there are exceptions to everything. Someone could certainly go through the trouble of following you or attacking you to get at all your homeless goodies, but it isn't likely. Someone could be halfway in your car before they notice you, panic and... try to punch you from the front seat? Try to stab you? If this guy decides to kill you, he's going to have a lot on his plate after that.  I slept in my truck for 6 months with the windows halfway down for the crossbreeze every night. The only extra precautions I took were sun shades in the windows and keeping everything of value not easily accessible.
errdtl,ff6rvui,,Try using truckstops.. you can use all the services like toilet, shower, movie room,etc. The added benefit is no one is going to bother you sleeping in a truckstop parking lot. Even the cops leave people sleeping in and around truckstops alone for the most part. During warmer months if you don't have a vehicle sleeping out behind the truck parking is the way to go because they're usually built away from residential areas.
errdtl,ff6qd86,,Nothing feels more at home than a tbell parking lot

errdtl,ffx1qc6,,I rotate between the rest stop, the parking lot near the laundromat nearby , and the Motel 6 parking lot... I was told by a fellow homeless fellow that Walmart doesn't get too annoyed if you sleep near the back. The laundromat is my favorite because of the WiFi being so strong, but I can't go there all the time because security roams around more often, so I'll go there and use the WiFi till I'm ready to sleep. The Motel 6 is pretty low key but still there's a possibility of getting woken up by some cop (never happened but never say never) or by the usual fighting and noise that comes with being at or near a Motel 6. The rest stop is the safest, but it's farther away from where my odd jobs and plasma donation center is so I only go there when my tank is relatively full or I can afford to put gas in it. Being homeless really teaches you survival skills and makes you tougher because you have to be.

I would lock up my bike about a block away from my work so that people didn't know that I didn't have a working car. I was not far off from being homeless. That was thanks to simply having a friend letting me do that for a few months until I made enough money to begin to build more infrastructure for myself.   I'm a doctor now. Pretty well off.   That was almost 20 years ago now, but I haven't forgotten subsisting on potatoes and eggs.

It also makes me subscribe to subreddits like this because I like to read the messages and sometimes comment.   Two years ago my house burned to the ground destroying everything I ever owned and leaving me homeless. I had insurance, and a friend's house to stay at, but I again felt what it was like to have nothing for awhile. Ive now spent two years rebuilding my life. Clawing my way back up.   Your current situation is just your current situation. There is a particularly good Vonnegut quote about this. It's about aliens who perceive time differently than us:  "The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever. When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is "so it goes."  So I say to you, "so it goes". right now just happens to be a particularly bad day. But you're not dead, so you have that going for you.   I also say, keep climbing. you only have to feel ashamed of your situation if you are unwilling to work to better it.
eq6d0y,,feov01f,Thank you for reading. And thank you for your kind words and the reminder. I truly appreciate the time you took to read and comment with compassion and offer hope  So it goes.
eq6d0y,,feop2aq,Thank you for sharing.  How did you go from homeless to college? I work so hard and I'm always on the fringe of homelessness,  I really want to gain an education so I can get out of this cycle.
eq6d0y,,ff1yeyg,fill outa fafsa. i recommend american public university.
eq6d0y,,feoo6kk,This.  This is beautiful. Thank you.
eq6d0y,,fevcy0l,Slaughterhouse 5 is a fantastic book. Extremely grateful my English teacher made us read it in highschool
eq6d0y,,fep7xky,Actually, you were homeless... unless closets are apartments... Godspeed
eq6d0y,,feugkie,So people wouldnt know you didnt have a working car? People must be pretty judgemental where you live. There are bikes that cost in excess of $2k-10k. I bike everywhere by choice and biking is pretty common where I live lol. Sorry, im just stuck up on that part. Since when is biking looked down upon.
eq6d0y,,fevhn70,I worked in a shirt and tie office enviroment. I got the job by presenting like having my shit together. I had to change my shirt in the bathroom in the local deli often after the ride because I was so sweaty. And yeah, if people knew I think I'd have been treated differently.
eq6d0y,,fgggsm9,Yeah American here who's visited a dozen or so countries, living abroad for 5 yrs. Im very unmaterialistic. One of the first jobs back stateside was one of only two IT people for a whole marketing firm. Was swamped with work and taking evening classes driving in an old car to boot. Sometimes in such a rush I would carry my belongings in garbage bags point a to point b. I didnt care, but then some ppl (mean girls) liked spreading rumors or whatnot. I wasnt homeless, though have spent many nigths in my car. At that time I was living in a motel because I had not time to find anything else.  Anyway, it saddens me how materialistic, esp among the young people this country has become. There I was, college grad, running myself ragged to make sure the IT infrastructure was up for the whole company, and a lot of ppl were putting me down behind my back and to my face some time, until pretty much had enough in a mutual separation. But because I sometimes brought my stuff in a garbage bag or my car looked dumpy at the time, some ppl there were infatuated with spreading gossip. Sorry for focusing more on patching viruses on your computer rather than making myself look like a A&F model! Makes me want to travel and leave again, but waiting to see if the world is as safe as it was before, before I do it. That or I wish I became a doctor or something with more prestige, I would need to take out a lot of loans to do that though probably.
eq6d0y,,fghc14x,(Don't worry, I took out an obscene amount of loans)
eq6d0y,feomy0c,,Most people never have an actual conversation with a homeless person. You gave him that by being honest, and staying true to yourself. I get that it feels bad to be so powerless and vulnerable, but you did something brave.
eq6d0y,,feoupg8,This is true. Maybe he had a preconception of what "those" people are like. We had a lovely conversation until that comment and then he was quiet, I'm guessing maybe he was embarrassed and I was as well.  I was definitely myself, making jokes, being friendly,  etc. And maybe he didnt expect that and it helped changed (even just a little), how he sees the homeless.   Thank you for your comment.
eq6d0y,,fepepky,You know it did! I‚Äôll bet that interaction really helped broaden his perspective on homelessness.
eq6d0y,feo5bkg,,You felt shamed because society conditioned you to feel that way.  There is no shame to one's circumstances of life. You're homeless. Accept it.
eq6d0y,,feom4m2,Happy Cake Day!
eq6d0y,,feonyaz,Thank you!
eq6d0y,feoex56,,Saying "I'm homeless" out loud is tough pill to swallow. Makes me feel like an Other. Those people that get walked over in the city where 5000 people step over them in a day and don't make eye contact. There's a revulsion of I don't deserve this, this thing just happened somehow due to crazy incredibly unique circumstances for each and every person.  I got in such a daze just not sleeping, sitting outside all night in the summer, and having a home base. Tired all the time.
eq6d0y,,feov7zj,How are you doing these days?
eq6d0y,,fev4cqy,Indoors since September. I got some help managing my finances and getting an apartment at a place that isn't crazy stringent about their leases. It is so hard to get a safe decent place that doesn't punish you for having gaps in previous address, employment, 15 references, etc etc  I have a place and a girlfriend. She sleeps over a lot and brings her dog. I love her, and the dog. She makes me laugh, cares about me, for the first time in a couple years I have a Favorite Person. She's my light. But there's this desperation. 6 months ago I was "sleeping" outside for dazed minutes at a time while crying, as train sounds and beeps and thunder or whatever would wake me up. Suddenly awaken freezing from a 3 am summer chill temperature drop.   I look at my girlfriend sometimes, knowing she's had a hard life too and all that, but I just wish I could know for sure that she could love me if I was the way I was in August. Off my meds, mania stricken having spent all my money. Hiking around with my belongings all sweaty and smelly and clearly wracked. No one talked to me all summer.   I have disabilities and have a hard time finding a place in society. I feel most at peace by myself, or with one or so people at a time. I look at the rush of people when I go out, just thousands of anonymous faces, people who don't care or interact, the ugly buildings, the litter, just apathy and struggle everywhere.   I get numb and want to just live in a bubble where I don't think about being homeless again, out there. I got agorphobic almost, and I don't like leaving my apartment much. I spent too much time the past few months lying down watching a stream and cuddling, trying to feel cozy and safe and warm and loved. Trying to kill that dread and hopelessness and fear and righteous sadness.   I'm running real low on money and I worry a lot. I'm stressed. I don't have furniture, i don't take my girlfriens out. We eat, watch free TV. Walk and play with thr dog. There are homeless people just down my block who panhandle at the intersection. I don't have a car but I walk on the other side of the road, often passing them from across the street.   I can't look at them. Not because I don't care, but because I care so much and feel guilty that I'm inside in a warm place. I could still be out there, in the cold with them, this ugly society failing them. It's like 25 degrees here right now.   I wish I could do anything for them, but I am terrified of money. I don't want to be homeless and I just want to pay my rent
eq6d0y,feolf06,,What helped me was making friends with other homeless people. Community is important.
eq6d0y,,feonub0,I make friends with mostly normies now and I‚Äôve gained a lot of acceptance. I care for the community around me and they see that.I used to be shameful about digging through the trash for a meal. There is nothing wrong with it. It‚Äôs natural to be hungry. The shame was preventing me from sustenance and it was wreaking havoc on my energy and mind and making me depressed. Since then I‚Äôm much happier.
eq6d0y,feoow23,,Normal,  hard working , well minded people end up homeless far too often. Do not feel shame because you are fighting the good fight.
eq6d0y,feoqc38,,"Why yes, driver, I'm the owner. I'll need you to open my door when we arrive".
eq6d0y,,ff1ynwm,rotfl  shoulda called him jeeves and waited for him to open your door, then dropped two gold sacajaweas in his fist
eq6d0y,fepmi7u,,Everybody's thought process is different, but admitting I was homeless worked for me.  I have been homeless for several stints during my life.  Every homeless episode was 100% my fault, except for the last time.  I had a nasty gambling addiction that made me homeless off and on several times over a 10 year period.  The last time, about 2 years ago, I became homeless because my vehicle broke down.  My income relied on having a car.  I became enraged.  I had been through so much hardship of my own doing, and now I'm just a guy trying to make an honest living, and I found myself homeless yet again.  It stung.  So, I spent a couple months feeling sorry for myself.  And I got nowhere. I made no friends, kept to myself, and was miserable.  There was no reason to socialize with THEM, I'm not one of THEM.  Those people are homeless!  What a horrible delusion I had.  I was one of THEM.  I finally admitted it.  And it felt good.  After admitting I had become everything I did not want to be, I was able to take the first step to get out.  And I did get out, about a month later.  For me, admitting I was homeless freed me to start doing whatever it took to get a home.  Today, I am happy, and have a tiny apartment that feels like a mansion because I clawed my way out.  I've since learned to save a little for a rainy day.  Another failed car is not putting me back on the streets.  I hope you choose to make this realization a motivator.  You are homeless today.  You will probably be homeless tomorrow.  But, if you start to take the steps to not be homeless anymore, next week, next month, maybe you will not be.  I hope your barriers become smaller, and your dreams come into focus.  Turn a negative into a positive and push on.  Your efforts will pay off eventually.
eq6d0y,fex643m,,Interestingly enough, I‚Äôve had similar conversations with Uber drivers, and I know that feeling of shame. Much to my surprise though, the few I‚Äôve told have turned out to be sympathetic. I don‚Äôt ask for money from anyone, but just having a comforting ear is what I need most these days
eotqu8,feff0ea,,No shit.  I was homeless for a while, female here, lived in my car, still did Uber/Lyft for work.  I even have mental health issues and did at the time, and I busted my ass to just keep going.  Having my car was definitely a benefit, and as well, it was paid off, so not having to deal with a car payment was nice, otherwise Uber/Lyft would barely cut it.  Just having to pay my car insurance and cell phone bill, on top of eating, gas and whatever other essentials, I was barely surviving that way.  Something to also to be looked at is how single, and alone, females, like myself, deal with being pursued by men just assuming that we're looking for something.  There are many men that will see women and attempt to prey on them.  I chased some asshole down the parking lot of a Walmart one night, with a fucking ball--point pen, screaming that I was going to kill him.  He wouldn't leave me alone, and I just went crazy on his ass, which is what I have read to do when you want to scare someone, just go total psycho, and it worked.  The last thing I yelled to him as we got near the Walmart store, itself, I quit running and yelled at him again, "I'll fucking kill you, believe me????", he yelled back, "yes!"  He wouldn't leave me alone, and at the same time, why did I even have to do that?  And that wasn't the first time, that was just the worst one, and I had to act like a fucking psycho, he could have just as well had a gun and killed me.  Fuck that shit!  I feel for my fellow sisters out there.  <3
eotqu8,,fegr8wy,This.....we have a lot of bums in our hood.  When I tell my BF how I feel threatened he doesn't understand.  I get approached all the time.
eotqu8,fefa1sw,,I'm drug, alcohol, and cigarette free and coffee is next on the list to kick. just 1 week In to this truck homless thing and i plan to do it for at least 1 year.
eotqu8,,fefb44r,Good for you...I‚Äôve slowly modified my behavior over time and drink about twice a week now. I kicked meth long ago. Without religion...I‚Äôm just more mindful and calmer over time.
eotqu8,,fefls26,many people are surprised when I tell them I quit drinking without religion.  there is more then one way to skin a cat.
eotqu8,fef0pvn,,So much cheaper to throw up our hands and say "Homeless are all junkies, nothing we can do" instead of admitting the whole fucking system is broken and need reevaluated from the ground up.
eotqu8,fef0wmw,,Probably not. The propaganda against homeless people is widespread. This narrative is even pushed by service providers who don't want to lose their jobs. That's why there's always calls for more shelters and "supportive housing" over creating affordable housing solutions.
eotqu8,,fef1dy5,You are correct, I was just fuming after reading another "most homeless are addicts" take.  Most homeless are normal people that have the misfortune of a combination of mistakes, poor choices, circumstances outside of thier control, and bad luck, and a broken system.
eotqu8,,fef2yij,You're preaching to the choir, friend.
eotqu8,,fefokwz,[deleted]
eotqu8,,fej37kt,Similar to the prison industry.
eotqu8,,feflc6h,Have you seen that American Dystopia by Tucker Carlson? Its pretty clear the interview in his second video is all staged.   He says shit like "Civilization is coming apart!" All clearly with the intent to make Trump notice him. He's probably been writting this since Trump took that trip to California.
eotqu8,feg7c9y,,To be fair, living that life substance is the thing that gets you through.   I don‚Äôt believe most homeless are not addicts, I believe a majority are. Not sure where the statistics that state otherwise have come from.   I was homeless for a long time so I saw that life from the inside and a sober or abstinent homeless person was rare to find.
eotqu8,,feky6k5,This.  Nobody here is any better or more worthy than an addict. The "but *I* am different and better narratives illustrate the very judgemental attitude they claim to be against.   So what if it is a stereotype? It is a real issue amongst the homeless, especially the chronically homeless who non profits arent even willing to help.   Just because it isnt about YOU doesnt mean it is an issue for others who deserve compassion and being seen
eotqu8,,fekzgeu,All homeless need compassion! A choice of substance is a coping mechanism for some underlying issue that has led to their current conditions üò≠
eotqu8,feftchj,,Try telling that to /r/Portland . You could slap them in the face with scientific studies like this, and they still would claim all our homeless are junkies. Yes, we have a lot of drugs, and because we are a large city that has resources more than a lot of other cities, a lot of the drug addicts flock here, but that doesn't mean most homeless people are addicted to drugs.
eotqu8,,fegc982,It‚Äôs an inverse situation I think. Many (idk if most) addicts are indeed homeless. It‚Äôs not true that most homeless are addicts though.
eotqu8,,fegjo80,the percentage of addicts that are homeless is wayyyy smaller than the percentage of homeless that are addicts.
eotqu8,fekxk6d,,Episodic homelessness is usually job loss or "bad luck" and a situation people fall in unexpectedly,  usually just once. Chronic repetitive  homelessness is often tied to mental health and addiction. It is a reality. It doesnt make it less serious or make homeless people "bad". It is just an honest picture and acknowledging that is what needs to be faced to address the issue. 0  These "but what about ME, I'm hard working and i don't fit the stereotype" stories bother me. You are no better or worse or more worthy than another homeless person or an addict.  Also, it isnt always about YOU.
eotqu8,fel35q8,,Unfortunately there is a minority of non addicts that get tarred with the same brush.  I pray that you find a way out!! Life in homelessness is difficult substance or no substance üíî
eotqu8,fefr2pk,,> *"Yet Wells, the El Cajon mayor, said he stands by his assertion. Wells is a registered nurse with a doctorate in psychology who for years worked in emergency rooms. He said that experience convinced him that the statistics are off."*  Wow. So since he's basing his opinion of an entire demograph of people based off of who comes through the ER doors, does he also think that most of the people in the country are suffering from broken bones and gaping wounds?  He never stopped and considered "hey, maybe I'm only encountering the people on drugs because, hmm, I don't know, maybe because I work in the fucking ER? Maybe I never see most of the people without substance abuse issues because they hardly ever have a reason to come in here, so I never have a reason to see them."
eotqu8,,feipj7q,I lived in El Cajon. It has a reputation for not being the most logical place. Also San Diego county as a whole has an extreme prejudice against the homless
eov42u,fefgny5,,Yo be careful eating raw meat. That can be very dangerous.
eov42u,,fefkt8x,not dangerous in the least you have been lied to. the truth is that raw meat is the healthiest food you can eat. our digestive system is closest to that of a scavenger.  raw meat requires no refrigeration and is good at all stages of decomposition. I am totally serious I am not trolling in the least. I have been eating a raw meat diet for over 2 years now and have taken advice from people who have been doing it for 10 years or more.
eov42u,,fefppgh,You can get so many illnesses from eating raw meat. Best of luck to you though. I won‚Äôt be trying it any time in my lifetime.
eov42u,fefwqdt,,Trollololol... Back to YouTube with you.
eow6jb,fefihsc,,You mean under $1000 for a month of solution? Or $1000 for a permanent fix, because I sure don‚Äôt see THAT happening too easily.  Hostel living can come in at less than $1000 per month, if you‚Äôre otherwise frugal, though there‚Äôs no real gains in the privacy department from what I understand.
eow6jb,,fefm1mm,The solution has to be for the garbage they leave behind
eow6jb,,fefp11a,For recyclables, requiring deposits could be useful, something like what Norway does; somebody would end up collecting most of it just for getting deposits back. In Lexington, KY the Ale-8 soda brand had customers return the glass bottle to participating retailers for $0.05 per bottle, I don‚Äôt know if they still do.  The worst part of the issue isn‚Äôt actually the trash itself, however - it‚Äôs the apathetic mentality that causes people not to care where their waste lands. Trash cans exist in plenty in most places the homeless tend to gather. If people won‚Äôt do something they should, create an incentive. As they say, you catch more flies with honey than salt.
eow6jb,,fetmgxz,You do realize that not every homeless person is leaving a pile of garbage wherever they go, right? Out of all the serious environmental issues out there what made you pick this one?
eow6jb,fegzzsn,,I live in an area that has a lot of street people.  The only ways that I've found to reduce garbage are: pick it up yourself or with a group, get the property owner to pick up the trash, or discourage people from certain areas.  Some people just don't give a spit.  One of the stranger things I've discovered with encampment trash is how much of it is clothing.  It's cheaper and easier to buy or get different clothing than to wash it.
eow6jb,fefiarj,,asset forfeiture for people with vacation homes and timeshares.  distribute excess real estate to the homeless.
eow6jb,,fel2qdm,Would you like a Timeshare? I have friends that will pay you to take theirs.
eow6jb,,fel9hnb,lol hellz yeah üòÉüòÑ
eow6jb,,fejxg59,The average cost to get out of a timeshare is $4,000 to $12,000, so if they did asset forfeiture for people with timeshares there would be line around the block of owners wanting to get rid them. Perfect solution, saddle the homeless with debt for a place that can sleep in for 2 weeks a year.
eow6jb,,fel9se2,naaaa. use eminent domain to get the timeshare.pay the owner a fair settlement. then give to the poor
eow6jb,feflyej,,The solution has to be about the garbage they leave behind, forgot to mention
eow6jb,,fehoiuo,Much depends on the tribe of homeless person.  My camp trash is 99.5% food and drink packaging.  So design a homeless supply delivery system similar to DoorDash. Allow people to use EBT or have vouchers issued for staples/commodities.  You could call it Camp Dash or some shit. üòÑ
eow6jb,,fehp638,if youre supplying winos like myself you can deliver beer wine and liquor in reusable steel and ceramic jugs with a return deposit. For food, same idea: insulated steel and ceramic military style field bins.  Cellophane wrap was developed with the advent of trucking and reefer trailers.  So trucking has to be bypassed: food must be prepared in local facilities in bulk.  Keep everything local and suppliers small scale.  In short,   BOYCOTT CORPORATE FOOD INDUSTRY
enxi93,fe7vf0r,,It's pretty common in my area. See alot of the cars with sun covers all over the windows at night in the parking lot. Seems a better deal joining one than having to pay a truckstop $15 for a shower or $50 for a motel room for the night.
enxi93,fe6digg,,As someone who uses Planet Fitness and is not homeless- it seems like this is a good option for some people but not others. It seems like there are some people who live in their cars, and this might work as a place to shower, maybe work out , wifi, etc. I've seen people there who might be homeless, they don't bother anyone, no one cares. This gym is also in not in a rich area, so I'm guessing people don't care if you're not fancy enough.   If you sign up during certain times, yearly fee is like $1 or something small. So it seems like it might be a good idea for some people but not others.
enxi93,,fe6wuir,Added bonus for homeless-in-vehicle, a lot of Planet Fitness locations are in malls, and careful parking gets a relatively safe overnight parking spot.   I also actually used the gym, since I had a lot of time on my hands. I was in pretty good shape, all lifestyle factors considered.
enxi93,fe9c2vc,,An alternative many people don't think about - but might want to investigate - is becoming a 'student' at a local community college (or, potentially, university). That is, you take the bare minimum of coursework to qualify for your student id - and that student id gives you access to all the facilities of the institution. This normally includes a gym/showers, but also libraries more pleasant than the public library, break rooms with microwaves, student events which often include free food, etc.  While this sort of option isn't practical everywhere, checking into it doesn't cost anything and it can potentially work out.
enxi93,,fea9ax9,I'm a student and have been homeless about two years. The university campus has been a great sanctuary
enxi93,fe8h7iy,,Even better, in my town the county gym facilities have cheap day passes. $2 for shower only on off hours, $4 for shower during peak hour and for entire facility access.   Only pay when you use it.
enxi93,fe9jh27,,YMCA often offers free membership to homeless. Here in Austin anyways. I have to tell you I was treated badly but I‚Äôm hopeful that what I experienced was rare.
enxi93,,ff5985e,Same in Washington DC. If you have a DC ID.
enxi93,fe72qqw,,I have a planet fitness membership. I workout sometimes. Other times I use it to shower and wash my hair. I did catch it when it was like $1 to sign-up. Otherwise the enrollment fee is like $59. I remember one time I didn‚Äôt shower for over a month. That shower felt so good. I was in there for like 30 minutes. I was so dirty‚Äîeven after the shower. I was able to roll dirt off my skin when putting on lotion.   People don‚Äôt like the homeless? Too f*cking bad. Reach out and help the homeless so we don‚Äôt have anyone homeless. I don‚Äôt care about your drug problem or mental illness‚Äî no one should be homeless!!! The same people with wealth have the same problems.   Anyway, f what people think. Stand tall no matter your circumstances today. People think they on top and it‚Äôll last forever. People need to humble themselves. People think they better cause of all the material crap they have been able to possess. Whoopty doo !
enxi93,fe8h3h1,,Meh, it's kinda shit advice imo. It works but it's more a van-life thing than a homeless thing. I've also seen gyms take the money and then a week later tell a guy to hit bricks for not meeting their dress code and other nonsense. Businesses are not above stealing if you look vulnerable enough that they don't think you could take it to court. If you're homeless you need that money for other more important things and the local public library can give you all that and for free. I've taken more than a few bird baths in public bathrooms to know this shit. Society should fuckin' wise up, the ancient romans had their famous baths open and free for all. It's yet another public necessity that modern capitalism has locked behind a pay barrier.
enxi93,,fea99cj,The libraries I go to all have strict policies about bathing in their sinks. One even had a sign threatening to "Call Police".
enxi93,,feake61,Word my man. It would be good for the public. We need more public things like that.
enxi93,,fixgqu4,I think small claim court is relatively cheap,  fyi. And I think it's an easy process.  Supposedly it's what it's there for - claims that are a small amount of money.
enxi93,,in2dmdt,Talk to the local police station about what would happen if you go in there anyway. You have a contract between the gym and u to provide y service for x amount of money. Albeit every cunt always writes we can cancel and kick out for no reason. Maybe contact the gyms corporate guys and try to get that gyms franchise cancelled. If they care on a personal level what ppl going in look like then that probably means gym profit goes to them. If they care without that condition then they're just tards
enxi93,fe9q5kd,,I‚Äôm a member at a different gym (which is $30/month) but there are a number of homeless that frequent my location. Having a shower, bathroom, wifi, electricity, etc. for even $30/month seems like a huge QOL boost.  It‚Äôs common to see a few people there early (5am) in the morning just to shower and get cleaned up.  And it‚Äôs not a benefit I‚Äôve heard anyone mention before, but I think the yoga classes with the short nap (Shivasana) at the end would help with stress.  At least at my gym, as long as you follow the gym rules I don‚Äôt think the staff or ownership are bothered.
enxi93,,in2fko8,That's not what yoga is for. Either way all that for a short nap is impractical. Yoga is for transforming ur consciousness, not for a pretext to rationalize satisfying your personal needs. You want an excuse to nap and relax so just do that, don't bring yoga into ur bullshit. There are no naps in yoga. If there is any sleeping it's conscious sleep where if you can't tell me what happened around you while u were sleeping because you heard it second by second then ur not actually doing it right
enxi93,fea3lj1,,If ur one Medicaid you can gave a free gym membership at any place. If ur homeless u need medical so get Medicaid and u pay zero. Go for it. Being clean, an extra place to park, that's a bonus
enxi93,fe6agx8,,Yes, but most homeless people are poor.
enxi93,feadch7,,It *can* be helpful, it kinda depends on the location and hours. I had one at a gym that had a location in the middle of downtown. It was convenient for a while, but then that location closed and there's not really another one near me. I have enough friends that have housing now that i can usually shower at someone's place.
enxi93,febdyp4,,Depends on location. Luckily, where I was at last had 2 different places to shower almost every day. Morning and evening. Public showers. Another place I've been, jump in the river or clean up in a gas station bathroom was the only option. YMCA also has a program for low income people that's only $35/month but you need a checking account.
enxi93,felpmnq,,I have one with Planet Fitness. And while the shelter where I live has showers, I don‚Äôt trust they‚Äôd be clean. While gyms could probably be similar, the one I go to is ok. So it‚Äôs better than nothing. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty common.
enxi93,fe85f1x,,Hell yeah! This is WHY I have a gym membership. I'm not homeless but anything can happen at any time; this includes fire or flooding in the apartment.
enxi93,,fe8rvsn,Do you have renter's insurance?
enxi93,,feb4mtl,That's a really good comment, yes and basicly I don't trust any company to provide in a crisis. That's just me and it's not logical. The gym membership is another form of insurance, and a way to get out of the cold and into a hot shower should that ever be needed.
enxi93,,feb6sna,I understand - just wanted to make sure you know it's an option in case anything happens to your apartment. My boyfriend didn't have renter's insurance when we met.
enxi93,,feb9qhl,It's the law here that we have to have it to rent. I'm really glad because it does protect people, and this is one of the few renter's protections we have if it works. I've had friends benefit from it in the past- so the companys do come through. Thank you.
entyt0,fe61f49,,Unfortunately I feel you, they're "Supposed," to protect and serve.  However IIRC, I remember hearing of a court case, that basically proved that to be false.  In general, The only responsibility the police has, is enforcing the law.  They're not there to help you, unless someone is breaking a law they can enforce, and it just so happens what that person was going to do was going to hurt you.  Then they might be considered "Serving," you.  Unfortunately, as any lawyer will tell you don't speak to the police ever.  No matter if they're a "Good," cop, they're job is to uphold the law, which often times will end up costing you in the long run.  You were fine to consider your options, and ensure you weren't breaking the law, the other gentleman did the same, and understood there may be something the police might be able to dig up, loitering, that could harm him.  So he left.  It goes the same for traffic, if you see a police car in front of you, what's your best option?  Pull over, take a turn, stop for a moment.  Stay away from him.
entyt0,,fe6a3xu, it is incorrect cops aren't actually sworn to protect you they uphold the law first then protect.
entyt0,,fe6bdde,That's what I just said...
entyt0,,fe6slu3,Ever notice the logo on cop cars changed from serve and protect to, 'patrol' and protect?
entyt0,fe5phmy,,I am not even homeless and I still get uncomfortable around cops. The issue I have is you cant tell a "good cop" from one who may kick in your door and shoot your dog or plant drugs in your car during a traffic stop just by looking at them.
entyt0,,fe5u9ew,Good...cops?
entyt0,,fe61630,That's why I used quotation marks.
entyt0,fe5eowj,,By remembering the police don't work for you, they work for the rich.  Your intuition is correct. Not having money isn't a crime; Loitering is. As long as you have money on you, they can't harass you into leaving. Like you said, you were gonna buy your daily coffee, so you would have been fine.  Dude that dipped was about to have a bad day if he didn't.
entyt0,,fe6swjt,> Not having money isn't a crime; Loitering is.  Some places where not having money is a Crime too. Called Vagrancy. So is Panhandling.   People are convicted for all kinds of menial fancy words. It sounds better when the judge reads the charge in court. 'You are charged with being 'poor', how do you plead', doesn't sound as good.
entyt0,fe8c97h,,The Police are the biggest gang in the world. I don't understand how anyone could feel comfortable around them. Anyone who does either, doesn't understand what they stand for/ who they serve & protect, at all. Or they possess a great social skill AKA the art of playing it 'cool'.
entyt0,,ffhmjjw,The best method of doing well with cops is appearing non threatening while not appearing too vulnerable either.
entyt0,fe65o93,,Best advice don't be afraid, look confident and don't be rude. Yeah they have a badge and a gun but they are still human. Took me a while to get over cop phobia due to some really bad experiences in the past.
entyt0,fe65hn4,,Just like politicians, a lot of cops are corrupt. They, like many politicians get caught and have to pay the price of losing their job. They are supposed to protect and serve. Not plant drugs on people or their property, or rape women they arrest, or make prostitutes give them sex in exchange for not taking them to jail.
entyt0,fe9ju2t,,If you are homeless, get the idea out of your head that they are supposed to be helping you. In a world that made sense they would.   The homeless are second-class citizens. Laws that go completely unenforced 99% of the time are meant for you. The law does not protect you anymore. The law only exists to get you under control.  You are wise to avoid police. If you possibly can avoid them, DO. If you are 50 feet away from a cop and they start walking toward you, walk quickly away from them and get out of the area. If they are 10 feet away from you casually, naturally, and slowly remove yourself from the area if you possibly can. If you can't, then don't do ANYTHING that will draw their attention. Yes this includes when you aren't doing anything wrong! They are more aware of the conditions and history of the immediate environment, and the law than you are. They may be perfectly able to make something up (burglary in the area? no tresspass sign that you were not aware of?, etcterea, etcetera). Then you disappear for several months before you even see an attorney, and several months more before you are able to plead 'not guilty.'   The existence of homeless people is evidence that the system doesn't work. The police are invested in that system, and will actively cover up evidence if it is in their interest.
entyt0,fe655vh,,Most cops are scum that only serve the rich and powerful. I never did and never will trust or like them.  There are rare cops that are the exception though. It just sucks that they're so hard to find.
entyt0,fe6jjfl,,Dont be terrified of the police. Be wary, be careful, be respectful, and ALWAYS follow their orders, no matter how unfair they seem. Each officer, each department is different. If you live in a town that hates the homeless, expect the cops to treat the homeless badly. Many police wear body cameras that record everything they do. You are allowed to record activities in a public place. If a cop is making you uncomfortable during a contact with him, ask to speak with his supervisor.   I know cops that have gone out of their way to make life hard on homeless people. I also know cops who have bought meals, clothing, gas, bus tickets and more, out of their own pockets, for homeless people.   Fear is a weapon in your adversary's hand. Dont give the police or others this kind of power over you. Know your rights and stand up for them, politely and respectfully.   Police are on the lookout for crazy people, drunk people, and violent people. Once they see you are none of these, they should leave you alone. If they bother you when you are not causing trouble, they may be one of the bad ones, so try to stay away from them.  Good luck to you out there!
entyt0,fe5iy2p,,I got over my fear by getting to know a few, developing a rapport. probably 1 in 10 are the kind you read about in the media when something goes wrong accidentally or deliberately. Avoid those guys but talk openly to those who don't seem to mind breaking ice.
entyt0,,fe655y1,I agree. I have only had one bad experience with a cop. Ive actually had one just sit his ass down on the ground and talk to me after telling me I need to move my tent. The key is to keep it civil. Its all about the tone of your voice and how you act. Most of them have to deal with a lot of bullshit everyday and I just tried not to be part of that bullshit. Keeping the peace is part of my responsibility too.
entyt0,,fe7dryf,Looks like, from the downvoting, this particular thread is overtaken by those who don't see it as their responsibility to keep the peace.  It's not my fault I'm in poverty (medical issues I was born with), but it's also not the police and others public employees fault. I have more visceral hatred for the venture capitalists and property developers who have made this reality than the peasant employees who are paid to maintain a small cubicle of it.
entyt0,,fe96uit,I completely agree.
entyt0,fe6xmrw,,Act like they don‚Äôt exist. Focus on your dreams and aspirations‚Äî not your surroundings ‚ú®
entyt0,ffhmg36,,The police are enforcers for the rich and powerful. You are rightfully fearful. If you keep a low profile they‚Äôll usually leave you alone but police often abuse power on the vulnerable with no money.
enc6yo,fdzc3lk,,Shelters are not a viable answer, because they are dirty, underfunded, mismanaged and are more often than not used by the people running them to cheat, manipulate, victimize, and exploit the homeless who use them. If you doubt it, go undercover and test it for yourself. I'd advise against it, because you will likely come out of it with at least one disease you didn't have before going in, and there's about a 90% chance you will be robbed, assaulted, or sexually assaulted during the time you are in a shelter.  Secondly, people have to get past this idea that somehow homeless people are miraculously, somehow, the only people on the planet who don't need money to live. Homeless people are homeless directly because they don't have enough money to afford a place to live. Of course they need money, they need it more than employed people do. "But what if they spend it on drugs?" What if they do? Do people with jobs spend money on drugs? Or alcohol? Or gambling? Getting people out of homelessness necessarily involves treating those people like people. There's no way around it. And that includes letting them manage their own finances, make their own decisions, and live their own lives. Just like "actual" people.  Lastly, this tired narrative that homelessness exists because of personal failings, moral weakness, laziness, etc. needs to die a permanent and final death. Homelessness, like disease, crime, and other societal ills is a *systemic* problem. Homelessness in the United States exists as a direct byproduct of the obscene disparity of wealth in our country. Homelessness is a symptom, not a syndrome. It exists in every society, and every country. Homeless people are not criminals, they're victims. If they resort to crime to survive or get by, it's because they don't have better options. Society can solve homelessness whenever it's ready, tomorrow if it's convenient. Here's the solution: spend some money to address the problem. Create or repurpose housing, provide support programs, fund it, and realize that infrastructure must be permanently maintained & paid for. Shelters need to be regulated, inspected, monitored, and funded. The potential for abuse of people in them is astronomic. We have to accept going into it that some people will never be able to truly care for themselves, will have to be helped and supported until their death, and that we have to do that and pay for it because to do otherwise is inhuman. No matter how many spikes you put on park benches, it will never end the homelessness crisis. No one has ever been successfully punished into prosperity.   This applies to U.S. homelessness, and the complete lack of systems to address it due to America's demonization of homeless people. I understand in Canada they actually have some pretty good support for people, but then again they're a civilized society.
enc6yo,,fe8uqlm,Every US citizen should read this comment.  Extremely well written and I absolutly agree with every iota of it. This is the truth of the matter.
enc6yo,,fe95rv4,Thanks, I think people should be aware of homeless issues too, but they'd have to care first and I don't see thank happening anytime soon. Nonetheless thanks for the compliment.   I've been homeless a few time so I'm just trying to call it like I see it & advocate for people who are in an unfortunate situation and continually victimized & demonized. Let's see if it falls on deaf ears again. Seems kind of like they're fishing for the more salacious angles (again), but maybe not.
enc6yo,,fdznz0i,[deleted]
enc6yo,,fdzou3l,What "sex-for-rent"thing?
enc6yo,,fdzzmoi,Hey sorry, accidentally replied to the wrong comment. I've deleted and posted the same response to a different question below. Yes, I hear you and these are all really interesting points. I've definitely come across people living outdoors because they say their shelter experience was either unable to meet their needs or traumatizing. Are there any cities in particular you'd recommend I look at?
enc6yo,fdxvos5,,I'll take the bait. When it comes to media coverage there are two topics that don't get covered enough, if at all. The first is the role that volunteers play in addressing homelessness. Much of the work around poverty and homeless is unpaid and there is an acute lack of volunteers. I know of cases where the staff of the homeless shelter are themselves homeless.   The second is the role private money plays in the system. News coverage tends to view solutions to homelessness as government driven but the truth is that much is funded by private charities or individual donations. That is an area an enterprising journalist could explore.
enc6yo,,fdxwy6k,Thank you so much! Definitely will consider both points. I didn't realize much of that work was unpaid. I've been trying to cover how private hospitals are investing in housing to help homeless people and I'll check out other sectors!
enc6yo,,fe0aaey,Private money goes both ways. In Portland we see private money going to more private security that exists primarily to harass houseless people on the streets, and the same bids (business improvement districts) that hire the security firms lobby the city for harsher policies. Late park director Nick fish (rip) recently tried to push a policy tailored to their interests that would stop the distribution of services and food by volunteers in parks near businesses downtown.
enc6yo,,fe35onu,The private agencies are often better places too
enc6yo,fdziff9,,Recovering your state  ID card, driver‚Äôs license, social security card and birth certificate are a big hassle especially without an address. Law enforcement could facilitate this by taking your finger prints as the primary source, but they will not or can not.
enc6yo,fe0771p,,I found that prior to becoming evicted  there were never any resources in the state of AZ.  My neighboring city only supplied housing assistance for deposits once a landlord approved you. The city I lived in offered rental help, but only to one person per month to the first person that called in, which doesn't seem like a proper way to dictate who has the most need.  I never understood why there were never resources to help people but always resources and housing for stray animals every other week being distributed on a regular basis.   The state of XX also gives landlords the authority to evict you in 5 days - they can also charge you however much they want for late fees on rent  which rolls over until paid in full.  I found myself paying $300+ every month for about 7 months straight because they wouldn't let me catch up with all the late fees.  For what it's worth, the homeless problem is the end result - better policies and laws need to be in place to offer more ways for consumers to stabalize themselves instead of crippling them by allowing low wages and extremely high cost of living, high penalty rates, unenforceable credit deferment options, limited funding, stringent requirement and long waitlist for emergency services.   &#x200B;  The double edge sword delima is also a problem.  You can't get financial/housing assistance if you earned a normal income in the prior month, and you can't earn a housing and money if you can't get assistance first.  The worse part about being homeless is that the tools and resources in place that are suppose to help us be dependant or stay dependant, do more to cripple you and make matters worse and cause longer periods of hardship. My family of 3 lives off of $480 a week, our hotel room cost $420 - and we've been waiting on food stamps since November because we don't qualify for expedited services due to our earnings.  Cash aid is not eligible, which makes us therefore ineligible for emergency housing programs because you have to qualify for cash aid first.  My unemployment will end in 3 weeks and I've been unable to find a new job due to the circumstances I mention below. In a nutshell, the system is backwards and seems to be setup to not provide help until you absolutely lose everything. Unable to pay your storage, so no clothes for interviewing, unable to pay your car and registration - so impound and sleeping on the streets instead of a vehicle will be unavoidable.  On top of that, try finding a safe place to park without harrassment by people or policeman.     &#x200B;  The worse part for me is that it all stemmed from an simple minor arguement and an overzealous sherrif who saw fit to arrest me for basically nothing at all. We both were innocent of nothing more than arguing over bills. I spent the night in jail and couldn't go home to return to my work as a telecommuter for 2 weeks.  DV classes which my employer refused to honor so I had to use up all my vacation time to attend classes and ultimately loss pay.  Shortly after that we were evicted and I was terminated because I could not work from home anymore.  The daily issue of 125 degree  weather and trying to live out of a car got the best of us - our car was set to be repoed so we had to leave town until we could obtain a shelter for my daughter and ourselves.  Unfortunately, housing assistance and employment frown upon domestic violence charges which can never be removed from your record in my state which I no longer reside in.    In short, had we been qualified to recieve assistance before we got to this point then we would have likely already been back on our feet.  The laws and social services policies however prevent that.  If you earn more than a grunion you are ineligible for emergeny housing or cash aid - no matter that you are starving and sleeping in a car or left living off $60 a week for a family of 3 and no money for gas or interview clothes.  not eligible for emergency housing or cash assistance - no matter how much you spend on housing/hotel costs.  Also, many shelters in the area won't even accept you with warrants or criminal charges - being that I had one more class to complete, I now have an out of state warrant so I will likely have to take classes all over again while trying to find a job and a place to sleep once my unemployement ends in a few weeks.   &#x200B;    All this over a simple non-violent disagreement between a couple led to distroying my entire life.  Everything that I worked for so hard for after having been homeless as a young adult 25 years ago.  This just doesn't seem right and I hope the laws change where they see how much the stringent policies and blind restrictions for assistance are hurting people and causing more poverty - setting people up to become dependant on long term funding assistanece instead of helping them when they still have a leg to stand on that will enable them to help themselves with just a little help.
enc6yo,,fe5964g,Thank you for sharing this story with me. I've been trying to research more about homelessness in AZ ‚Äî¬†rents and homelessness are both rising unusually fast, in tandem. This helps me understand.
enc6yo,fdz18g4,,I'll bite, too.   A bit should be said regarding the sex trade and homelessness. This involves both men and women (usually young people, but often older people taken advantage of, as well). It's the underbelly of homelessness, where people believe they have to do something in order to gain "X" (a place to sleep, protection, daily needs, drugs, what have you). People who "hire" people to do day labour, and end up abusing them. Cops taking advantage of young girls. Shelters taking advantage of women. Etc ad nauseum. And no one cares, or believes those who speak up; or people are just afraid to speak up. The documentary in Seattle regarding Tiny ("Streetwise") barely covered what was going on in the 80s with run-aways. It still happens - male, female, young, old, no one is immune to the potential. These people are the victims of of both perps, and the victims of other victims.
enc6yo,,fdz4qx3,I care, although I know these things are very hard to talk about. You can DM me or my email is emma.ockerman@vice.com.
enc6yo,fdyd1y9,,I for one am tired of hearing that homelessness is all about substance abuse and mental illness. This is a means to justify inaction. With skyrocketing rents, one minimum wage full time job won't cover a roof anymore, so if you can't work out a cohabitation with anyone for whatever reason, you're doomed to homelessness.  The van and RV dwelling community is rife with retired people who've adjusted their life, but guaranteed most would prefer the stability of a roof and if it were viable. Most pensions no longer cover the high cost of housing.  There's also a large swath of medical bankruptcies and people who are simply too disabled to work full time.  A lot of folks are also screwed out of SSDI and VA benefits. Most of those alone would not allow a roof overhead, but they might allow treatment  and voc rehab that enables a person to get back on their feet.  Most of the people I mention above are hidden and pass as non homeless. IF you see a van, mini van with curtains or RV at a 24 hour gym or Walmart parking lot, they're likely homeless.
enc6yo,,fdyegk6,Thank you, I really appreciate your perspective!
enc6yo,,fe0758d,You might want to check out boondockers lots of older RV dwellers are just homeless. They work Amazon the beet fields and host at campgrounds. They are hidden homeless. Lots lost homes and or good jobs during the housing crisis and never recovered. Many in failing health
enc6yo,,fe0ta0v,There‚Äôs a book on this called Nomadland
enc6yo,fdyxr2x,,Part of what the problem is is how hard it is to pull yourself back up. Like even if you get the money at some point, you usually need a cosigner to rent...and when everyone you know is basically homeless too, that's not gonna fucking work
enc6yo,fe0f1dr,,We could buy every homeless person in the US a house at fair market value for 1/6th of one year's military budget. Humans need food and shelter to stay alive. Why are basic rights denied to so many for simply being born already-poor?    Cap inheritance or this society is finished.
enc6yo,fdzpqtv,,Most people associate the "hobo" look with homelessness, of course, they exist, but homeless people are often sitting right next to you at a restaurant, working with you at your job, driving on the same road as you, walking down the same sidewalk with everyone else, blending right in. All in regular clothes, sometimes pretty well taken care of. The only difference is we're finding a church, a park or a parking lot to sleep in.   There's a lot of legislation against homeless people being put out in different cities. Things that directly affect the homeless person's ability to survive, and are set in place to "solve" homelessness (push it out of town). Most people seem to be against it or express outrage, even if only on the Internet towards their local news station, but the cities kinda just do it anyways. I know it's seen as more common on the west coast but it's everywhere, of course. I live in Wisconsin and while I was homeless, I saw a local paper explain that the "homeless count" was down to zero. I have to wonder how they figured that since there was at least one (me) at the time.  So these very regular people that could be right next to you every day are basically being legislated against (usually at least somewhat indirectly). Or sometimes are being completely overlooked.   I'm happy to now have a place of my own, but it's a struggle being in the streets. It's stressful, exhausting and extremely depressing at times.
enc6yo,fdzxosy,,Anything you can do to humanize homeless people.
enc6yo,fdz4gw4,,Not everyone who is homeless sleeps on the street, in a shelter or in their car. My wife and I were technically homeless for a few months (and may become so again in the near future if things don‚Äôt improve for us) and were staying with friends. While I acknowledge things could have been worse, ‚Äúcouch surfing‚Äù is still very mentally/emotionally taxing as you have to basically walk on eggshells trying to stay in your friends‚Äô good graces so they don‚Äôt kick you out. Even though we tried very hard to be good guests, we ended up being kicked out of the last place we were staying due to an accumulation of petty perceived issues (which we weren‚Äôt made aware of until it was too late). We are currently renting a room from a friend of a friend but are behind on all our bills and while our landlord is very understanding, I fear that we will be homeless again very soon.   My wife and I both struggle with pretty severe depression and anxiety which has caused us to lose jobs and reduce hours worked. I‚Äôve been trying to get on disability but the process takes so long that I‚Äôve given up and am looking for work again (unfortunately to no avail) knowing that it will ruin my chances of getting disability if I find a job, and knowing I‚Äôm likely to spiral again if I go back to work, because we‚Äôre literally at the point of nearly losing what little we have in terms of housing and transportation.   My wife and I are both transgender which makes things harder, as it‚Äôs perfectly legal to discriminate based on gender identity in Wisconsin. We‚Äôre both under 30. I‚Äôm sure our story is not unique and there are many homeless trans individuals in their 20‚Äôs in similar situations. We‚Äôve tried reaching out to LGBT organizations in our area but they all only help youth - the oldest they would help is up to 21 years old, and since we‚Äôre both in our mid-late 20‚Äôs, there‚Äôs no real resources for us. Also, most of the shelters and homeless aid in general around here comes from the Salvation Army, which is known to be anti-LGBT and especially very transphobic. We‚Äôve both been rejected by family members who have the means to help us but are unwilling to do so because we are transgender.   Transgender individuals are an incredibly vulnerable population in regards to housing and employment, and many struggle with their mental health due to dysphoria as well as non-acceptance by family and the community at large. Even many LGB people are transphobic, and many supposedly ‚ÄúLGBT‚Äù organizations focus mainly on LGB. So wether the aid is coming from a religious group or even a supposedly LGBT focused group, transgender individuals are often left out.  Basically what I‚Äôm getting at through all of this is I think the amount of people you wouldn‚Äôt think are homeless but actually are and are couch surfing or whatever to get by is probably huge, especially amongst people in their 20‚Äôs-30‚Äôs, and that transgender people are often overlooked and have a harder time not only surviving while homeless, but also getting back on their feet and getting out of homelessness, due to discrimination both within and outside of the LGBT community.
enc6yo,,fdznvbp,Thank you, this is a perspective I haven't heard from yet so I really appreciate you sharing.
enc6yo,fe043rf,,when i was houseless as a youth i, like many of my peers, was running from an abusive situation at home. i'm housed now, but a lot of these kids end up in cycles of poverty because they have no support or social nets as minors.  one of the best things the youth drop-in shelter did for me was provide an address and a ride so I could get my ID and eventually a job with the same address, this needs to be more widespread and accessible for folks.  now as an adult, i'm starting to volunteer with food not bombs in the wake of an anti-street "sleeping, sitting, walking, laying" bill recently passed locally.   volunteers are feeding and protesting for houseless folks when we can, but handcuffs over housing will never be a solution. another group in austin is working to stop sweeps of homeless camps by occupying them and watching peoples' stuff who aren't willing to take the risk of arrest to slow down and stop the city from sending it to a landfill.  none of this would be a problem if housing was the main focus of government and even corporate or non-profit outreach and intervention.  also i've heard nothing but horror stories about day shelters for adults, so unfortunately.  my heart goes out to anyone experiencing homelessness.  *edit to add:* the 911/public sector safety needs SO MUCH education on the causes of homelessness, EMTs/Firefighters/Cops have all called houseless folks "trolls" to me and most that i've worked with (in an ER too) see these folks as a blight and very seldomly see them as individual human beings.
enc6yo,fdzz4dq,,Cops in my area recently started ticketing for holding a sign. I'm terrified of getting a ticket I can't pay so I'm severely cutting my already small diet to ensure my food stamps last.  Also truckers are a problem, for me anyway, at least once a week a big rig is flagging me down, saying he's just bored. Like the homeless bitch knows where the funs at. I'm just walking cause I can't afford the bus.
enc6yo,,fdzzrp7,Hey, I'm really sorry this is happening to you. DM me what city and I'll check it out.
enc6yo,fe0es01,,The working homeless.  So many people are homeless and working.  Especially in the Portland area, I know a few including myself from time to time.  I wouldn't call myself homeless at this time, but I might be again soon.  Can't get approved on a lease with a friend.  I've had decent income but been bouncing around and staying at hotels, occasionally in my car.  Each house I have tried to settle in has been a bump in the road, costing me precious time, and money trying to get settled and into, or straight up robbed by scammy people.  It might even be easier to simply define a person as Homeless, as any adult 18+ not on a known apartment lease or contract, and does not own property or have a mortgage.  You might see that number drastically increase, and be significantly correct.  Right now, I'm staying at a home not necessarily illegally, but I'm sure in violation of the lease agreement that the person I rented from.  When your in the situation of desperation you tend to not think about it, or at least not be worried about the paper yet.  You just want a roof over your head.  I have to constantly lock and monitor just my room to protect against theft from the other roommates.  I also wish I had my mini fridge, unfortunately in storage a long ways away.  Anything I've left in the fridge has been absolutely stolen by the roommates.  They eat all the food, and drink all the drinks I buy when I left it in the fridge.  Edit:  To add, it's all because of rising housing, and stagnant wages.  Even for people with supposed "Good," jobs, or technical jobs, 20 bucks an hour still feels like minimum wage, it's almost feels like a small droplet of water in comparison to minimum wage.  Throw in a few tips and minimum wage in OR looks more enticing.  I've often thought of leaving the technical world to go back into service where the jobs provide tips.  Even a small amount can add up quickly.
enc6yo,,ff5tbaj,$20 an hour is not enough income to afford a one-bedroom apartment in many US cities, after you add in health insurance, student loans, car payment, etc. Lot of people are sharing apartments way too small because of this. Or they quit trying and live in the car while they work a normal job.
enc6yo,fe02jre,,I read this article recently: [Sooo True Article](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/12/linda-tirado-on-the-realities-of-living-in-bootstrap-america-daily-annoyances-for-most-people-are-catastrophic-for-poor-people.html?fbclid=IwAR2JWd8_ZhD1VYIwoXxLffhKTVgdYZudLQ5SxkTcVGUM_vnwEFn_NFfnDP8)   I would suggest going into more depth on what this person wrote a few years back.   Becoming homeless when you have children becomes a whole different level of homelessness. If you can‚Äôt get into a new apartment quickly enough, you risk losing your children temporarily if you don‚Äôt get into a shelter.   I also suggest going into depth on the struggle of getting affordable housing once you‚Äôve become homeless. First, you don‚Äôt want to pay more than you know you can afford and second, will a landlord even rent to you if you have past evictions. Oh and then add in utility bills you may owe money on. If you don‚Äôt pay those off you won‚Äôt have a way to get gas and electric in your new place.   My husband and I camped during the summer, lived in a rental car and ended up staying with a family member where we seem to be stuck with no hope of getting into an apartment any time soon. Kids are with my nmom because there is literally no space for my children here. We are on the waiting list for public housing. Have been for 6 months now. Still nothing. We can‚Äôt afford 3/4 of the apartments available for rent and the other 1/4 not rent to us because of past evictions.   Good luck with the article!
enc6yo,,fe59fps,Hey, thank you so much for sharing this perspective. I've actually been trying to look into this ‚Äî¬†people worried about losing their kids to the system because they're homeless. I'm sorry about what you're going through. DM me if you'd like to talk more.
enc6yo,,fe5hnsf,Thank you! We were told that we couldn‚Äôt lose our children for being homeless. So my nmom found another way around that by making false accusations. Sadly, because we had just lost our apartment, her accusations were believed because of our instability at that moment. It‚Äôs very sad.   If you have anymore questions to help with your article, please feel free to ask. You can dm me also. Ty for replying!
enc6yo,fe15ncw,,As others have said, different degrees of homeless.  Some are by choice. Some have a difficult time finding homes because of past crimes and or credit. Some are mentally ill. Some are between jobs. I have been homeless several times in my life. All of which unfortunately could have possibly been fixed with some mental health support. But not knowing where to go and not being able to pay for a therapist, or antidepressants, I destroyed my life in the state of mind I was in. I'm doing well now but will forever have to deal with consequences from the lack of options available to me.
enc6yo,fdxzzee,,i got somethin for ya.   i was homeless in the wealthiest communities in the US: The Hamptons LI, Marin Cty CA, Palm Beach FL, Aspen CO, Palm Desert CA, etc in order to document the disparity between the poorest and the richest.  I know a homeless guy in Aspen who built a treehouse with wifi, subfloor heating, a hydro turbine for electricity, etc. He ziplines in & out.  Theres a tribe of us who dont fit neatly into any common narrative. I have a MA and study the classics + Napoleonic warfare. Spent much of my university years in Europe, doing field surveys.  We are homeless mostly to fight back at an unjust system rather than out of bad luck.
enc6yo,,fdy8uax,If you've chosen to live in a nontraditional manner then you aren't "homeless".
enc6yo,,fdy9c7h,yeah i suppose not. ive had housing and i dislike it after awhile. Dude in Aspen is not homeless either i told him that semi-jokingly. If anything hes a evil genius üòÉ

enc6yo,fdxzbc5,,I know that Seattle had a news feature called 'Seattle is dying" that focused a lot on how the opioid crisis is affecting the homeless population here.  I would look at that more, because I don't think that feature was as accurate as it could have been.  I would also look at how homelessness affects the surrounding communities not just the downtown areas of cities.
enc6yo,,fdy0rn2,Thanks, I'll do that!

enc6yo,fe04uet,,@op... I'm my own worse enemy... I don't manage money well and don't do very good with planning... I recently quit my job, cashed in my 401K I paid off 2 student loans and my land... I was gonna to solve my homelessness problem... didn't work out.  Why? Primarily because I'm a sex offender and the land is a area where the cops don't want me to move, so they won't sign the paperwork to allow me to move onto my land until it's fully functional...water well, septic, etc.  I'm broke and living in my car...no job (day labor only). Looking to sell this place and buy a place in another state with cops willing to do the paperwork so I can be legally registered.  Most places won't rent to sex offenders; my best option is buy a place outside the city...fine by me; I don't wanna live in any city anyway.  Hopefully this post will broaden your perspective... Godspeed...btw, vice has some good docs...
enc6yo,,fe0unad,I don‚Äôt know your situation but I think you can be listed as a sex offender for stupid things like public urination that don‚Äôt necessarily make you a horrible person. Is that right?
enc6yo,,fe1g6l7,Pissing in public... gotta use discretion... those getting charged with indecent exposure probably didn't do that...OR claim it was accidental... my charge was more serious
enc6yo,fe1ij32,,I work for a program that assist at-risk homelessness and the homeless with financial assistance.  The hard part in housing the homeless, at least in California, is the high cost of rent. We can provide the first 3 months of assistance but if they are on a fixed income like SSI, it's almost impossible to get approved. And much of the affordable housing have their wait list pending any where between 1-3 years.
enc6yo,fe21tgi,,I actually tried to go into a shelter in my area. It cost $300 a and you have to give up your food stamp card. they drink and do drugs and OD there. The woman who owns the place is on a power trip and thinks she's Queen Sheba. I went to a food pantry, was given 4 cans of vegetables, and a can of sloppy Joe mix and cheese sticks. I had no can opener and I'm diabetic. Been passing out from low blood sugar. Smaller Southern towns suck.
enc6yo,fdzu1vw,,Are you kidding me?? The usa is not a free country. They commit genocide daily to it's own citizens.   People must know ur one check away from being homeless. If you go out on ssdi well one must make 3x that rent in order to rent. This country sucks. I'm a citizen.   My husband is in congestive heart failure and we live in my car. I hold 3 degrees a masters too iv worked for the ex Senetor of pa. The governor here should feel ashamed. He occupies a home that we the citizens pay for and his health insurance too.   No one gives a shit. These politicians need to try and live this life. I am in social security ssdi I worked all my life. I get 1400 a month minus 400 on insulin and meds medicare will not pay. How does one live on a little money like 1100 dollars. I got divorced because they count my husbands income as well but he cant work now.   I really wish usa was a good country but it's not. They do not care about its citizens
enc6yo,fe8omx0,,It's damn cold. Not "uncomfortable, I left my jacket at home" cold, it's to the bone cold. I have been forced to tears many a night and some days. It is difficult carrying around blankets, sleeping bags, jackets, hats, scarfs, etc., and when not being stolen, stashing them somewhere becomes an anxiety filled nightmare. No one looks good bringing 6 backpacks and a sleeping bag to any job. No one.   Planning where to sleep can take up most of some days. Deciding if it will be safer to sleep alone, in a small crowd or with a group will take up the rest of the days. Then, setting up, settling in, only to be wakened up and told "you got to go" by the cops an hour later. Going down the list in your head where to go next and knowing that you are lower than dirt and you will be removed 3-7 more times that night will be exhausting. You will give up and find a place to sit, surrounded by your now filthy blankets and stare off into the distance, a catatonic state that becomes very familiar. I actually almost walked into the path of the metro train in one of these sleepless trances. Long Beach definitely didn't like that. Citations are common but I don't have to worry about work because I still have to figure out where to put my blankets in the morning.   Showers, simple hygiene, washing hands, washing your hair, sitting on a toilet, taking your time while sitting on the toilet, brushing teeth, small miracles when accomplished, but all done in the public eye. Everything done, crying, sneezing, laughing, staring, talking, changing, everything, in public. You become immune to people. I sat down in Target, eating a sandwich, on the floor, after plugging my cell into one of the laptops in electronics to charge. No one did anything.   You are completely invisible and ignored when not being moved, arrested or cited. Forests, riverbeds, mountains become great places to live.  Shelters are awful. I am not a criminal and I don't have to be grateful for a substandard cot, dirty blankets that are numbered, a diabetic's nightmare of a dinner, told when to use the bathroom, when to turn lights out, hiding cell phone as they aren't allowed, registration into databases I never asked for or about, untrained, minimally paid staff. When I hear that a town has closed a shelter, I think good for them, now maybe they can focus on solving the problem instead of not washing the blankets.  Theft. You will be stripped of everything you own several times. It hurts each time. You don't bother getting ids anymore. No one really cares who you are any way. Except for the guy renting out motel rooms. He cares and you are not getting any room with no Id.   This is one of the most horrifying experiences of my life and it is next to impossible to get out. Housing first, I matter.

enc6yo,fe09u3j,,https://wraphome.org/housekeysnotsweeps/  This campaign has had some success recently, but encampment sweeps, especially in cold places like Portland, remain a deadly threat. They are conducted without the required due process and effect the people who can‚Äôt access shelters for one reason or another the most.  More articles:  https://www.portlandmercury.com/feature/2019/12/05/27586044/acceptable-losses  https://katu.com/news/local/homeless-plan-to-rally-against-camp-sweeps-in-downtown-portland  There‚Äôs also the Montavilla neighborhood‚Äôs violent response to houselessness, which has been rumored to include white nationalists.   https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-portland-homeless-vigilantes-20181218-htmlstory.html  I know a little more about Portland‚Äôs treatment of the houseless, if you have any specific questions.
enc6yo,fdzjixx,,Well, to start, you need to recognize that the 'visible homeless' you see are only a small fraction of the whole. The people you don't see are marginally employed (by which I mean low wage/part-time) people living out of their cars, youngsters (whether teenagers or young adults) couch-surfing, the middle-aged guys hidden off in the woods (rather than in encampments), etc. These people are important because they're often the low-hanging fruit. They don't have serious mental illness or drug addictions hindering them and they *can* be easily helped, but they don't fit what people view as 'homeless' so no one bothers.  > I'm also working on stories about criminalization (tickets for panhandling or sleeping outdoors), sweeps, encampments,  Something you need to keep in mind is that most of the time, these are aimed at homeless people who are legitimately making a nuisance of themselves and disregarding the concerns of others. It's not like police officers just wake up and say "boy, I really want to go roust some homeless people!". Someone sends them out there.  Indeed, something I see as lacking in homelessness coverage is the acknowledgement that many homeless people are simply terrible to be around. The one unifying factor in homelessness is a lack of a support network. Sometimes this is because they never had a chance to develop one. Sometimes it's because they just didn't maintain theirs very well. But sometimes it's because they're just awful people who drive others away. Don't let your sympathy mislead you: there are people on the streets who view your 'help' as merely a success in their scam.  > landlords taking advantage of homeless women in sex-for-rent schemes, etc.   This is a bit more complex than you're making out. There are many women for whom this sort of transactional sex isn't an option. But there are woman who *are* willing to trade sex for getting off the streets and having sex with one guy you know is probably better than having sex with multiple guys you don't.  Women have the ability to judge for themselves whether or not they're going to engage in these transactions - and it's really only wrong when their choice in the matter is taken away.  > keep up with advocates around the country  'Advocates' is a polite way of saying 'people who earn a living by exploiting the misery of others'. Ever notice that despite the fact that the only source of income for those 'advocates' is money earmarked to help the homeless, that they're not homeless themselves? Or consider that if that money was directed *at* the homeless rather than 'advocates', we'd get a lot more bang for our buck?  There are certainly decent people in the homeless-industrial complex. But there are also a lot of sleazy people. You're just looking at them from the wrong side.  The key takeaway here is that if you plan on reporting on homelessness, you need to be very skeptical. Many of the visible homeless will lie to you just to get what they need from you. Many of the people who work with the homeless will puff themselves up in front of you while exploiting and mistreating the vulnerable people they supposedly care for. Politicians tend to be more concerned about appearances than solutions - their job is to preserve property values while allowing their constituents to pretend to care.  Lastly, you might consider abandoning some of your preconceptions. For example, take a look into the devastating impact child support payments or sexual predator laws have on rendering people into a permanent internal exile.
enc6yo,,fdzzdtg,>Hey, thank you, this is all really important for me to consider. You're right on the sex-for-rent thing, and that's something I should consider. Do you know of anyone who might be able to speak with me about a situation where this was what they wanted and it wasn't coerced, or where it was an option that was good for them at the time? You can PM me.
enc6yo,,fe3a8rj,Thank you for this perspective!  Especially about the problem behaviors of some people.  I also agree some people are in it to serve themselves.  There is a person in my community who fabricated a few crises and makes sure they get lots of local media time and daily social media post about how much they do.  Its really disturbing when they brag how their "volunteers" help them around the home and with their kids!
enc6yo,fdzqwum,,One of the most amazing things I see is that people are ok with people begging but they will not help someone do better in life. Honestly I'm supposed to have a job interview Monday but why should I even go someone stole my ID and it seems no one wants to help me get it back
enc6yo,fe4r8gr,,(Unpaid) volunteer at a warming shelter here funded by local private charities and churches (not government, although there may be some public funds, I‚Äôm not sure exactly). I am not homeless and therefore my voice should not be considered over the people here who are, but I will throw in my two cents and say we have a really hard time attracting volunteers (the shifts are overnight). Everyone goes through a background check and our volunteers are therefore from a clean background, but sometimes the volunteers we get don‚Äôt bother to follow procedures correctly or get to know our guests. Some of our volunteers are great though. It‚Äôs just hard to be adequately staffed with good people when operating on a shoestring budget, and there are many preconceptions about the homeless community that make people not want to volunteer with them directly.   Homeless people are all different, like any group of people. Some work, some struggle with alcohol and drugs, some are disabled, some struggle with mental health issues, some have been in and out of jail, some are fleeing abuse, some will get violent if provoked, some will steal even from the other guests if they get the opportunity, some will give you the shirt off their back. We will sometimes get the invisible homeless (people who live in their cars, etc) on nights where it‚Äôs VERY cold. Most of the people we take in would otherwise be on the streets or in the creek (homeless encampments on the edge of town). It sounds cliche but homeless people are people. There‚Äôs different degrees of homelessness and different root causes. For some people, they‚Äôre able to get back on their feet after a few months. For others, we can see them year after year.   Tldr- the shelter system, in my experience, is under-resourced and there are limits as to what we can do or provide even in a well resourced system.   People fall into homelessness for a huge variety of different reasons.   Homeless people are individuals and don‚Äôt fit into a singular preconceived box of what homelessness is or means.
enc6yo,fek7yyo,,Can you let people know about how mixed status families are afraid to go to shelters and seek assistance due to the fear of losing their family members? Our family of 7 lives in a vehicle over a shelter because we can't trust that ICE won't be informed of legal status of family member. Also, billions of dollars are given to programs but mismanagement if funds is a huge issue. This needs to be exposed. Most money doesn't go towards housing and often times we are led down dead ends where you can't even get help because the places are closed, don't exist or out of funds but constantly receiving donations. Go to their website and you see the asking for donations but don't really cater or care about the people they are supposed to be helping. Yet people freely give to these organizations but are Leary of homeless people when they ask for money?  Homeless shelters are extremely filthy they lump everyone together families with kids, people with substance abuse and mental health issues,into filthy spaces turn the lights out. You cannot rest ESPECIALLY if you're there with your children people steal wallets and personal belongings and rape and sexual abuse happen all the time. It's so noisy you can't sleep so many people I talk to prefer the streets or their vehicles. Some staff members make it harder for people to access resources as well.  So please go undercover so everyone can understand what is going on and why these programs don't work instead of blaming homeless people  hopefully they will realize that it gets frustrating because you can rarely get out of this alone but you really don't find  the help that's needed.  It is hard for an individual that is homeless imagine how much harder it is for a family. The waitlist for housing is over  5 years in some areas. Credit issues and lack of employment placement keep you stuck as well. Food banks in my area give you less food if your family is homeless we get 1 standard grocery bag of food and can't return for one month for 7 people and it's filled with mostly items that you need a stove for. There's place to shower for kids and  no places that offer a place to laundry.  So many things go on but you have to see them to understand.
enc6yo,felo1zm,,We are seeing homeless people in more rural areas around our little town now.  It has really increased in recent years.

enc6yo,fdyd4p0,,If you consider homelessness for very long, you are going to start asking why it happens.  Even if you don't ask it, your readers will.  The common belief is that housing is too expensive, and that it has risen recently, and that this must therefore be the primary cause of homelessness.  Look at  [https://www.supermoney.com/inflation-adjusted-home-prices/](https://www.supermoney.com/inflation-adjusted-home-prices/)  which shows that the cost of housing per square foot in the USA - when adjusted for inflation - has hardly changed in the last forty years.  So figure out why it really happens.  Report that, with facts and figures, and you will earn a Pulitzer.
enc6yo,,fdyfd1g,Thank you! While reporting in larger cities (New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Austin, etc.) people often tell me that high rents and low wages made housing difficult for them, and that they couldn't establish the savings necessary to make a downpayment on a home (even if it would be cheaper than paying rent in the longterm!) What's true in your experience?
enc6yo,,fe06od9,Don't listen to baby boomers telling you how they got out of homelessness decades ago. It's not applicable to current events.
enc6yo,,fdyxv3d,In my younger days, when my peers and I were struggling to establish ourselves financially ( mid 70's thru mid 90s ) nobody tried to go it alone.  We were usually three or four per household.  When  someone did save enough for a down payment, he would recruit several roommates before buying.  We never believed that minimum wage was enough to live on alone. We knew that it wasn't.  The only difference now is that some people believe that it should be.

ejfrjb,fcxiyiu,,Awesome I bet your fukn excited üòù  It's always a strange feeling getting housed after being in the streets but it's such a good feeling too. I got housed through a program in my city too (a while back now).. but I had made a comment on This sub about looking for your social services in your city, and lots of ppl took it the wrong way.   It's not always easy, and it is a process, but once u find someone to help u it's a blessing. I wish u all the best üñ§  Side note: one time I was at a shelter and these ppl came in and they were doing a long term study (they kept up with us and did it over maybe 5 years). And they brought in a button (40 percent of ppl got housed and the others didn't but u still did the study.) Basically u pressed a button and if u got "yes" on the button, u got housed. I didn't but it was a pretty cool experience. It is proven that housing is the first necessity and once homeless are housed it's eaiser for other things to fall in place.
ejfrjb,fcxraik,,I've seen the Housing First model do amazing things! I really hope cities continue to shift the focus and resources towards housing. It's really changed the landscape where I live, on how we approach homelessness.  Unfortunately, it has left some gaps in emergency services (because those resource are reallocated), but we're also housing people almost faster than we can keep up (I'm a HF/permanent supportive housing case manager).  There is a residency requirement, so I wont say where I am; the best method is for towns/cities to adopt and implement this model on their own.

(not me, this is hypothetical)  I read this subreddit as well as others and when someone opens their home up it rarely seems to go well for either party.  You, having been homeless, might have a better insight on why you would or wouldn't offer help to someone that is in the position you were in.  And, congratulations on your new home!
ejfrjb,,fcy2ljw,Hi - Formerly homeless and work with folks now who become newly housed after being unhoused for a while .. issue is leases are really strict and management companies can be less than sympathetic in situations when you take in a family member or friend . If they are not on the lease they usually can‚Äôt stay longer than 2 weeks . Also if you were to make them your roomate the management company may require a background /credit check even for a roomate so that‚Äôs STILL a barrier. Also a lot of vouchers like section 8 ones have restrictions that would put the voucher in jeopardy if another person who was not originally in the household moves in. Folks even if finally housed can‚Äôt afford to risk being evicted over a lease violation just for helping a friend out. But it still happens . Ugh it sucks . Sorry minor rant on the system that prevents you from helping others when you‚Äôre finally on your feet .

I bet that if you visited your local market that you would enjoy your time spent , the food you acquire/eat and want to come back again and tell your friends about these amazing places in our communities.    Farmers markets are full of opportunity and doubling food bucks for what is often higher quality and more food is a huge opportunity for people to eat healthy foods and quite possibly find work , friends, fun , etc During the market season a homeless person can visit the market weekly or more as there may be more than one depending on the city and some grocery stores are also participating in this program as they stock food from local growers.   I can think of many foods that you can buy at the market that keep a long time and even if they are perishable I am sure many can still enjoy buying food this way.   also this can help prevent homelessness by allowing people to stretch their money.  the foods I am thinking of without much thought into this are potatoes, nuts, squash, onions, baked goods, etc and even with more perishable foods , many homeless people do have ways of storing food and even if not its still often cheaper this way.  People may have friends that allow them to store food or coolers , just as a fyi, the earth is 56 degree 3 feet down all year and so maybe some people are storing food what in what is essentially a root cellar.   What I hope is that many homeless, soon to be homeless and potentially homeless people find their local markets and are able to find cheaper and healthier foods and quite possibly work, friends etc. as Farmers Markets are some of the most wholesome places in many communities and can definitely help many people find their way to a more stable and sustainable life.
ej4k6x,,fdcpvkg,You are aiming this at people who are begging strangers for pennies and unsure where their next meal is coming from.
ej4k6x,,fdhwtaj,This is free food. SNAP is the free food program through the US government.  and people  can double the value of their food bucks through this program at participating stores and farmers markets.  ---  I am homeless. Can I apply for SNAP?  Yes. A permanent address is not required to apply for SNAP. You can get benefits whether you live on the street, are staying in a shelter, or are living with family or friends on a temporary basis. Homeless individuals and families who do not have regular shelter expenses can claim an automatic deduction from their income  http://www.gettingfoodstamps.org/faqsaboutsnap.html
ej4k6x,,fe7mvdn,Yeah I know... while I understand the concept and I realise your post is well intentioned, my point is just that most homeless people are just trying to survive.  Not looking for farmers markets and suchlike.  Add in other issues they may have plus the fact that most don't want homeless people around them.   I see you are really passionate about this which is great, I'm just making the point that it's perhaps not for everyone here.
ej4k6x,fcvezy1,,Double SNAP Value for Fruits & Vegetables @ some Farmers Markets & some grocery stores too,  Ive pinned the links and posted them in the sidebar of old.reddit on r/DoubleUpFoodBucks to locate where this is available.  ---  Double Up National Network  https://www.doubleupfoodbucks.org/national-network/  ---  Across The Nation   clickable Map  https://fairfoodnetwork.org/projects/double-up-food-bucks/   ----  r/FoodStamps
eihz9y,fcqgtt3,,You were a real mensch! Don‚Äôt let the jerks bring you down, and best of luck in the coming year!
eihz9y,fcrinzd,,I do things like that too, all the time. Don't worry... if you don't get the money from the sister, you will get something much better down the road. Good deeds do get rewarded, you just don't know when it will happen. Good for you for being there for drunk girl... hopefully she remembers what you did for her.
eihz9y,fcrvn7e,,Even after I got a place, I was still poor af, and struggling to avoid being homeless again.  I got the "no backpacks" speech then, too. I had no other way to walk and ride the bus with the groceries.
eihz9y,,fcymxoe,Yeah, last year when I was working and inside I had to wear a backpack to keep my workthings in and no one said a word to me until I was working downtown one day where there are more homeless ppl, none of the stores would let me use their public restrooms so I had too walk three blocks to Starbucks on my 15 min break.   This sort of stuff doesn't just affect the homeless but anyone who looks poor enough as folks will assume the worst. We need class to be a protected class like sex, race, and religion but not even the most liberal politician would ever want to make it illegal to discriminate against the poor because so many local laws as well as a majority of businesses already do so it would piss off all the important people and I the courts would be loaded with cases about innumerable laws that would then be challenged as unconstitutional due to them discriminating against the poor (laws about not sleeping in cars, banning sleeping outside in city limits, things like this)
eihz9y,,fczlvtu,You're absolutely right. The trouble is, as you say, the "most liberal politician" isn't going to be able to pull down this authoritarian plutocracy any time soon. The current system is by, for, and favors the rich. I think the reason we were talking about single payer government healthcare access for all ten years ago, and it became everyone must buy health insurance because the plutocracy won out. Insurance companies have already motivated to fight against anyone that wants to challenge their legitimacy. It's also happening with higher education, coal, oil, and pharmaceuticals. They know that the poor are becoming aware of the injustice, and they'll do anything to stop us from being anything more than a few voices desperately trying to talk sense.
eihz9y,fcslheu,,She is really lucky to have run into you. You seem like a really good person. I hope the rest of your day has been better and I wish you great things for 2020.
eihz9y,fctirjg,,Good for you. It's important for people to read this sort of thing -- I honestly never thought of the backpack thing. I'm sure that they selectively enforce this policy, and that's really not fair since people experiencing homelessness don't have a place to store their bag while shopping.
eihz9y,,fcylkgk,It's awful when they refuse to take responsibility for it if it gets stolen. Being homeless you meet and know most of the homeless in your area over time and I know a few junkies who's sole hustle is snatching bags, purses, backpacks unattended at stores and I don't want to lose my meds but their too valuable to risk hiding as someone will take them and just throw them away hours later when they realize there is no recreational value. Maybe despite being a dude I should just start wearing a purse
eihz9y,,fdvxc89,Or a cross body or messenger type bag.
eihz9y,,fdy9o4x,They just say no bags
eihz9y,fctr0x3,,Bless you. May this year be kinder to you as you do deserve. I pray you have food, shelter and warmth soon.
eihz9y,fcu4tvg,,Happy new year! üéÜAnd bless you for helping your fellow humans üôÇ
eijr91,fcsapaa,,Omg stop people. Look god cares for you at all times. God is not doing anything to you. You must get some help please
eijr91,fcrv44s,,I believe in God. But I think you might have a mental disorder you should seek help for. What area are you in?  I have some pretty severe mental issues myself so I understand how hard it can be to admit you might have a problem. But I promise you it can get better if you let someone help you.  God put these people here to help you, he made the doctors smart enough to diagnose and treat you and created medicine that can make these intrusive thoughts more controllable. Don't fear them. The more you allow God to help you, by accepting the help provided by his angels here on Earth, the more he will bless you. Just remember it's all from him and for him, he loves you and doesn't want you to suffer.  Good luck.
eijr91,fcr1sok,,Would it be not-stealing if you contributed more to the household  as far as your own resources go? For example, perhaps you could do more of the chores and allow her more free time? Your worth is not tied to money.  In fact, depending on your circumstances, you going homeless might distress your Mom to the point that it would cost her emotionally.
eijr91,fcsaukg,,I think maybe you need some help which is more than we here can give you.  Can you talk to your doctor about how  you feel?  Or even, I wouldb't normally suggest this but being the holidays so doctors are closed and all, could you go and speak to your minister about you thinking God is punnishing you like this?
eijr91,fcr335d,,The Lord is my shepard, I shall want. He maketh me lie down on the cold hard sidewalk, He leadth me away from the soup kitchen,  He provides me with burdens,  He leads me to piss in the thorny hedge for his name sake.   Yeah, when I walk through the valley of drug addicts I shall hope for no goodness; For he has left me With no hope and no prayer.  He prepares me as a banquet to be feasted upon by my enemies. He annoints me with blisters and boil. My cup is perpetually empty.  Surely mockery and scorn shall follow me all the days of my life and in this way I shall be in the dwelling of the house of the Lord, forever.
eijr91,,fctlubl,Wow. Dark stuff man.
eijr91,fd30qcm,,Pray and fast before taking such a drastic step.

eijr91,fcr7dyj,,There are group homes and shelters you dont have to live on the street. I guarantee you will do much worse things than you thought you would when you feel the desperation of no shelter
eijr91,fcqz9q0,,God loves you and does not want you to feel guilty.  He doesn't mind you worshipping idols, despite what some people will tell you.  Most of them are his cousins.  BTW, which idol was it?
