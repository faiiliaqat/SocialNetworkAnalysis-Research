10y27vy,4,negamoonspoon,6,homeless,Spent first night unprepared for cold thunderstorm,"Yesterday, the guy who works at the storage unit that I would keep all my things, sleep, and read; decided to lock me out completely without even telling me. My lock was cut off and a red one was placed. I had access to nothing last night. All my toiletries, sleeping bag, water, clothes, etc. all basically taken from me. I was so pissed. I know it wasn’t legal but the guy himself said he was gonna turn a blind eye and if I get caught by his other coworkers then it is what it is. Yet he kept going out of his way making random comments and issues and then suddenly locked me out completely. I wasn’t dressed correctly for the weather last night as I had an interview that morning then was at the library. When I came back and saw what happened I had no way to change into anything thicker nor knew a place to go as I’m new to this city. I’m just soo frustrated especially cause I got the unit only 10 days ago and never bothered a soul. I just sat quietly and no one ever knew I was there besides this one worker. I don’t know what the sudden issue was as he got aggressive with me the day before this happened by opening the storage door while I was sleep and simply shaking his head and saying yep this isn’t gonna work for me. There aren’t really any homeless shelters, a few of them tend to certain demographics of homeless or is a first come first serve basic with a limited amount of beds. So I was unable to travel to these or I simply missed the time slot. I have no clue what I’m gonna do now as I can’t afford basics as I only have like $20 left I believe. Last night was so cold and windy I could barely walk to my interview cause my legs were so damn numb.",2023-02-09 11:33:22,2023,2,9,11,33,22

10xv1r7,55,Rachel_Silver,7,homeless,"After being homeless for over a year, I have a place to live.","I got a bed in a sort of assisted living facility for people with mental health diagnoses. It's located in an apartment complex; I'm in a two-bedroom with three other people. I moved in Monday. Well, so far I brought a duffle bag full of clothes and my toiletries. I'll be bringing the rest of my stuff here over the course of the next week. 

I lived in my car for the first six months or so, but circumstances made that no longer a viable option. I was in an accident (my fault) and totaled one car. I got another with the money from my insurance, then totaled that one six weeks later. The second accident wasn't my fault; a car in the oncoming lane slammed on it's brakes, and the car that was tailgating it swerved into my lane.

I swerved to avoid it and hit a utility pole. The other two cars went on their way, so I was left with no witnesses. I knew if I reported it to my insurance, my payments would skyrocket, and I was already struggling to pay them. It was painful, but I had to junk it and work out a new plan. 

I was fortunate to have someone who was willing to let me set up camp in his garage. There was a gas station two blocks away with a bathroom, and there are two places in my city where homeless folks can shower. I have food stamps, and I mostly lived on canned foods (usually eaten cold from the can) and microwavable stuff from the gas station. I had electricity, but no heat. 

Being in an apartment is weird. The other people in the apartment seem cool, and my roommate has pretty much the same diagnoses I do, so we get along great. But being in a warm environment is proving more difficult to adjust to than I expected; if I sit still for more than fifteen minutes, I fall asleep. I've missed two medical appointments so far because I dozed off. I think I also had a sleep deficit; I slept a lot when I was in the garage, but it wasn't what you'd call quality sleep.",2023-02-09 06:42:33,2023,2,9,6,42,33

10xl0zt,5,cantthinkofnameahhh,4,homeless,I need someone to talk to.,"I made a post about this the other day on an alt but deleted it out of anxiety. Anyways, I fucked up my life. I had it all and became complacent. I lost everything. I burned bridges. I fucked up. I'm about to be homeless. I have a plan, but I'm not sure if I should do it. I don't know if I'm about to make the best decision of my life or the worst. I'm currently in the process of trying to join the army so that Im not homeless, but it isn't going smoothly. My recruiters sent me to MEPS even though we all knew that I would fail the bodyfat requirements, but none of us knew that MEPS wouldn't let me come back until June. I lost the weight really fast, so now I'm able to join, but MEPS has a rule where you have to lose 1% of bodyfat every month or something like that. Since I lost the weight in only a month, I still have to wait until June to be eligible to go back to MEPS. So now I have to survive until I can finally go back. I can't be too upset at myself. I made bad decisions. It's all my fault. And honestly, I deserve this. I'm going to endure this. Idc what it takes. But I'm scared. I'm not the type of person to be on the streets. I can already see my future where my backpack and duffel bag get mugged from me and I'm left with nothing. I can probably do this, but I'm terrified. I've cried so much that I feel dehydrated. Tomorrow my friends are gonna pick me up. I'm gonna go with them to help them clean a couple of cabins and then I'll stay the night with them. Hopefully I'll find someone to talk to on here that can give me advice. I'm in a state that made it a felony to camp on public property, so I think it's best if I go somewhere else. Not to mention it still gets too cold here at night, so I need to go somewhere warmer. I think I'm gonna hitchhike. I trimmed up my beard and packed most of my stuff already. I have a nice looking jacket to wear as well as pants and a belt, so hopefully i look presentable enough to actually get picked up. I think I'm mostly scared of getting harassed by police. I'm terrified more of going to jail than I am of being homeless. If I could get to somewhere warm where I can get food from a homeless kitchen and just spend my days preparing for when I can join the army, then I don't think this would be so bad. But I just know it'll be the opposite. Sorry, this turned into more of a rant about my situation than anything constructive, but I really feel like I needed to post this. I got to eat one last good meal with the people I'm currently staying with. When we left we stopped at a light where there was a homeless veteran holding a sign. I gave him a $5 bill. I really should've kept it considering I'm about to be in the same situation as him, but I almost felt obligated to. I thought maybe it would give me some good karma. Even when I do good things I'm only thinking about myself. Everything sucks.",2023-02-08 21:13:24,2023,2,8,21,13,24
10xkh9c,12,icedteaandme,17,homeless,Anxiety about being homeless again,I've been homeless off and on since I was 17. The most I've gone without being homeless was for 18 years when my late husband saved me from the streets. He died coming up on 6 years ago and I became homeless again when I lost our house after he died. I got a place off and on renting rooms for the last few years. Homeless in between renting rooms. My anxiety about becoming homeless again has gotten so bad that I've started ordering things online that will help when I become homeless again. I just needed to get that out.

10xd8rk,7,Medical_Price8780,30,homeless,Working with no place to stay,"Hello, I'm 19, and I have no place to stay. I currently reside at my mother's house, but I want to leave because she and I argue too often, and she's often telling me things in a subtle way to indicate that she wants me out. She also complains about how I'm not on the lease and I need to leave. 

I stayed with my relatives from June to December of last year when I first moved out. I left after I had graduated high school. They practically kicked me out because of their own selfish reasons, because I did what I was told and helped whenever they asked. I also have no friends, so the asking to coach surf at a friend's house option is out of the question.

I applied for Job corps, (for those who don't know, it's a government funded program to give education to the less financially fortunate.) but it has been over 3 months since I applied and I hadn't heard a thing from them. Now, I'm having second thoughts about going. 

My mother told me that I have until March to leave. I was looking into shelters, called, and was practically turned down. The lady recommended me to go to job corps, already trying to get in, and she told me to join the service. I do not feel comfortable doing anything related to the military, whether I'm actively working with it, or just being on the sidelines. My career path doesn't align with it either. 

So my question, is if any of you have any options to what I should do? I want to work. Like, seriously. I feel depressed having to go to job corps. It was my decision, but my mom is just doing it as a way to get rid of me because she doesn't want to deal with me. She makes it seem as though it's for my best interest but it isn't LOL what I want to do, I have to go to college for. I live in Maryland, living closest to the following cities: Nottingham, White Marsh, Towson, Middle River, Baltimore, and Catonsville. Please give me any suggestions. If I had no choice, I'd join the military, but right now I have room for choices.

10x41bz,10,Sogda,3,homeless,Medi-Cal help for homeless - California,"Hello California friends- Right now, California is overhauling the medicaid program (Medi-Cal) to include housing services. If you do not have health insurance, you probably qualify for Medi-Cal. Now, through your Medi-Cal provider, you may be eligible for meals, housing, and other social services. These specific services are called “Enhanced Care Management” and “Community Supports” and are available to those that qualify at no cost. So…. Where to start… it’s likely a local community clinic knows about these services or you can call the department of health care services.

10wd36l,4,Rude-Comb1986,11,homeless,Think Before Running Away,"I want to preface this with a disclaimer. I don't want your pity, I hate pity because it feels so fake. I also am not posting this for some guilt tripping into getting money, if you offer me money in any way I'll tell you flat out no. I'm posting it here soley for the fact people won't do that.


So I 'ran away' from home when I was 18. I had been planning this specific escape since I was 17 but I had been trying to run from home since I became conscious of the abuse happening to me. That was back in middle school so I'd say my planning spanded four years. Technically three years because my first attempt at 16 failed and I was locked up in a dog kennel in my family's basement for the later end of sophomore year.

When I ran away at 18 I had planned it so I would wait till after the graduation party, I was sheltered but I had gone to one graduation party before and my older brother had graduated so I heard you get money when you graduate. I wasnt allowed a job my mother wasnt managing so storing money was very hard. I also had saved the links to all the homeless resources I could find into the notes of my phone. I remember packing the day I left and just. I was SO scared, I knew then and I still know now that if I went back home I would be put in the basement and this time I wouldn't get to see the sun again.


I drove away going to my friend's house and my parents flipped their shit, I was forced to return my car I was fully prepared to take over the responsibility of paying for insurance of my and had the money ready but no good. My father threatened my life and calling the cops if I didn't bring it back and I brought it back due to be so scared. 


That's when I saw a glimpse of how shitty it is to be homeless, I walked everywhere and if you live in America you'd understand how unwalkable it is. I got a job but the walk to work was three miles with steep hills and it was mid summer. I ended up quiting after going to a mental hospital. I went because I was walking home and collapsed due to heat stroke and just laid in a heap of limbs and a bike on top of me, cars passed by and no one stopped. I came too after who knows how long and was still way to hot. My body was fighting me but I got me and the bike home.



I went in and out of psychotic episodes, I went to the mental hospital again after a miscarriage and that's when things got a bit better! I stared doing better cause I got better job at a cleaning company.

I didn't have much money anymore, I had 1,100 when I left but sprinkled through my journey I'd run into my parents and they'd make a huge scene.


So fucuding  to just a little over three ago when I got that cleaning job I was living out of my car and eventually stated renting out the basement. I was finally living the life I dreamed of having excuse a few hiccups here and there. 

Then I relapsed on alcohol. Let me tell you that being homeless means that at some point some drug is gonna show up and you're gonna have to decide for yourself what you do. I was stressed because my boss was being strangely framilar with me and getting upset when I didn't want to spend time with her, this triggered some flash backs to some cases of attempted sx trafficking I went through and I was not handling it well.  I drank two cans of some alcohol my friend gave me (big mistake because I didn't check the percentages).

I can't remember that night well but this is the basics, I couldn't get inside to my apartment because they (my landlords) locked the one door I didn't have a key too so I went back to my car and continued drinking. next think I know I'm waking up to the feeling of choking and my seat belt is hnging me. I unbuckled it fell against the right side of my car and passed out again. Woke up and this time I vaguely realized my car was crashed because the front windshield looked cracked to me I touched it and cut up my hand and I guess that was enough for me to get to work. I wasn't found by the rescue team until around 2-3 hours later and I a mix of hypothermia and Shock were shutting down my organs. 


Obviously I lived, but I lost everything in that crash including my job, appartment, and my birth certificate, ss, and important court documents. 


It took me until today to finally be able to get a hold of the impound lot, turns out I need to pay a shit ton of money to get my stuff out of my car. Money I do not have any can not get because I have no job. Further more I have taxes I'm getting help figuring out and if I owe money I'm fucked because I do not have the money for this.


Conclusion? Just know that no matter how many years you put into planning something it can always change at the drop of a dime. Or a single can.",2023-02-07 14:03:53,2023,2,7,14,3,53

10w9007,13,JayStrat,16,homeless,"Duffel/tent suggestions, general suggestions","Hello people.

I am about to be homeless at the end of March. I had planned on living in the car, but thieves stole the catalytic converter, title, and registration. The title and registration were out-of-state and I'm not even sure I can get the dups in time, and if I can, I have a 2K+ repair job I can't afford (aftermarket is illegal here, so it's full price or nothing at all).

Anyway, that's just the woe-is-me part. I guess I need a decent tent and duffel. I'm looking for temporary housing and I may get some through the state (I am on state insurance and get help and therapy already, so they have set me up with a housing manager), but the case manager says all shelters/temporary living are full and on wait status, and that I have a better chance to get it once I am actually homeless, which I guess means I will end up hoofing it. Hence the need for a decent duffel I can put a tent in and still have some room for clothes and whatever else. Recommendations?

I don't know what I'm doing. I have never been homeless. Prior to trauma that lit up existing mental health issues a few years ago, I was a public high school teacher. Now I can't hold onto a job. I am on medication and getting better, but it feels like a slow road. Too slow for me to maintain housing, at any rate.

Thank you for any ideas.

Edit: Thank you. I am in southern California. Orange County. I have access to a phone for the time being. I'm not sure of budget...some friends raised a few hundred for car repairs but the repairs are still out of reach, so I guess I have a little. Maybe $200?",2023-02-07 11:22:44,2023,2,7,11,22,44
10w8ot8,7,Flat_Maybe,5,homeless,Helpful Temporary Housing Idea,"Hello all. I have been ruminating on this idea for a while and I would love some feedback from you all about the practicality of it. This is all dreamland and wishful thinking for now, but I am hopeful to be able to implement it someday.

My family has been looking at large tracts of land to homestead, build some yurts and cabins for renting, possibly put in some hook ups for RVs to camp, etc. We have been thinking about how to add a component that could be beneficial to the homeless and transient community. We have a couple of  ideas that I would like to hear your thoughts on. 

1. Build a small, bare bones cabin near the edge of our property that is unlocked and available to those passing through without the need to ask us. We would have signs posted about private property, but as long as things are taken care of, it is free to use for a few days, as needed.

2. Have one of our yurts or cabins available free of charge, as needed, with a reservation required, and a time limit of a few days agreed upon. 

We would be glad to hear the pros and cons. We are trying to balance safety of all parties, practical logistics, and preserving the dignity of everyone involved. I know there are many things we are not thinking of that need to be taken into consideration. Is this even a realistic situation? Do you have other ideas that we haven't thought of?

10vusru,26,veryberryblue,27,homeless,"Am I the only one with ""food fantasies""?","Yeah, maybe a wierd question but being dirt-poor or homeless can do that to you.

In my case and due to my specific situation/circumstances, I have been living off of the cheapest of TV dinners for years. One meal per day. Some days, it's just one meal consisting of a generic can of pork and beans and some fruit.

I don't even remember what a home-cooked meal tastes like anymore. Like meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans. Maybe a piece of cake or pie for dessert.

I find myself frequently fantasizing about cheeseburgers, fries, milk shakes, fish and chips, roast beef sandwitches, pizza, subs, tacos and that sort of thing. My mouth waters for awhile and then I try to put it out of my mind.

Not saying that being homeless is some type of paradise (it's NOT) but at least I could go into 99% of restaurants and bum a meal and multiple times a day if I wanted to. Being stuck in a run-down old shack with little money and no car may sound better that being homeless (and maybe it is in many ways) but living on a meager diet of cheap food every day for years is no picnic either.

I'm being kicked out by my mom, I'm 21 and female. I have my own car, it has some problems but overall is reliable. I'm working right now, but can't afford to live alone and have no credit built at all. I live in Michigan, we're going through our coldest months right now. I do not have any friends or family to stay with. I have been homeless to some extent as a child, we stayed in random people's houses/basements from what I can remember though.

Does anyone have any tips at all, for anything? Right now I'm hunting for a room to rent potentially before I end up in my car, I'm saving up as much as I can too. Where I live, is very expensive for rent and the like. I would really like to not leave town because my job is here, along with my girlfriend. Its looking like I will be staying in my car for a little while at least which I'd really rather avoid, but at least that has to be better than sleeping outside.

Everything feels so overwhelming and it is so difficult handling this alone. I am in therapy and have been for a very long time now, I was planning on asking if my therapist may have any resources for me but it seems there just isn't much in my county.

Spent 6 weeks living in my car to get financially approved for the apartment and my friends drop out and in desperation I signed whatever paperwork I could to secure this place and get out of my car.


 It's completely unsustainable now. I'm behind 3 to 4 months on all of my bills. Rent is 2k I'm shelling it all out on my own because my roommate is disabled and unable to find work. Also a dear friend of mine that I've known for years. He helps around the house but other than that financially he gets about 380 in stamps every month. I work anywhere from 8 to 16 hours a day nearly every day at two jobs and I'm just burnt out. 


I unfortunately cannot find a roommate. Because I do not have another room to offer them to sleep in. No one trustworthy wants to hold up to basic living standards to get along in a roommate situation. I've vented on here multiple times and it's like people don't want a place to sleep from the cold. 


No matter how many times I look or vent. How many hours i work. How much debt i put myself in for loans. No one seems to want to just be a decent human being and contribute to a household and become friends.

Land Buddy is an off-grid platform that gives you news, ads, and offers from people who live off the grid to join their off-grid communities or villages. These communities or villages have beautiful tiny houses or apartments, and instead of paying rent, you work the land or learn artisan crafts. It's kind of like a medieval society in today's world.

The idea that modern serfdom might one day be the solution to housing-related poverty fascinates me. Students who typically have low incomes would be able to attend school without having to pay rent and would learn a skill that could help them earn money. Families are welcome in these off-grid communities, which can be found worldwide.

I've always been drawn to societies of the future. When you think of serfdom, you probably picture someone in a medieval society who was forced to work the land and didn't have much freedom. However, in today's society, modern serfdom doesn't take away any rights, and you can take advantage of all the perks of the modern world.

Although this is not the case, when people think of Off the Grid, they typically envision living in the middle of nowhere without access to the internet or utilities. Solar panels or generators power the majority of grid-connected homes, and utilities are either partially on the grid or powered by an Off-Grid source.

I believe that happiness is greater in a community where people share interests than in a city where no one knows anyone. Because everyone must constantly see each other and get along, inequality is lower when the population stays small. My personal opinion is that the society we live in, which is dominated by large cities or towns, contributes to poverty and this opinion of mine is also a fact.

You care about the people in your household and want to assist them when you live there. In a community that is Off the Grid, this is the same. I believe that these off-grid communities will eventually replace the norm.

Inflation isn't just a problem for housing. The cost of food has also skyrocketed. The majority of Americans have reduced their food intake or stopped purchasing certain foods, such as eggs, as a result of the rising cost of food.

In this new society model we have a society with sufficient food, freshwater, and housing for all if the majority of people grew their own food and engaged in a variety of trades, as well as better health as a result of less junk food consumption and healthier lifestyles as a result of physical labor. This kind of society would also be best for families who are currently homeless or poor, but in reality, it would be great for people of all social classes.

Although it is true that this concept could result in a dystopia in which we live in districts similar to those in The Hunger Games, there are probably those who disagree with it and claim that it will not result in a dystopia so long as it is implemented. Additionally, millions of people worldwide and President Biden and Ted Talks support this concept, which is why I am confident that this society will become a reality. Last but not least, People will be forced to conform if costs of living continue to rise and quality of life continues to decline.

10tp2ss,87,tuggyforme,148,homeless,"I feel we should rename ""Family"" Shelters, to ""Everyone-is-welcome,-except-for-single-men"" Shelters.","This would be a lot more accurate a name.

Family shelters accept women and children. Including single women.

LITERALLY the ONLY type of people they don't accept are single men. They accept literally all other parts of society, boys, girls, women, and every other type of human on earth, except for single adult men.

So they should just be honest and just call it what it is. A ""Eveyone-is-welcome-except-for-single-men Shelter.""

This way, when some men end up committing horrible desperate acts of survival, people will stop asking why it's mostly men doing these things, and will understand these are a DIRECT result of discrimination. Maybe it's because they're excluded from the last safety net of survival? Nothing tells a person ""society does not care about you"" like denying them access to a decent shelter just because of how they were born.

The emotional damage that results from experiencing this type of discrimination is absolutely irrepairable. This injustice in their most critical time of need... being told that they are subhuman, and not worthy of survival, that stays with them forever. If that man had any drop of love or empathy for humanity left in him, you can be guaranteed that after experiencing this, it is now gone. Gone forever. This is how monsters are created.

It's 2023. No other part of life or society is GENDER-SEGREGATED anymore. So why do homeless shelters need to be? Why divide and torment people like that? Like they're some kind of farm cattle?

If some men are dangerous criminals, then throw these men in prison. But the overwhelming majority of single men are NOT dangerous criminals. And we should NOT treat them like dangerous criminals. It DEHUMANIZES them. It breeds resentment and contempt for their neighbors, their community, and the world.

\*update: I find it interesting that while the overwhelming majority of redditors in here upvoted this post and AGREE that this discrimination is wrong, most of the actual replies are trying to excuse this type of discrimination.

It's as if the people who are pro-discrimination feel they need to be extra vocal.. like they already know they are in the wrong, and need to defend their hypocritical views. Or are looking through the comments to find vindication for their hypocrisy.",2023-02-04 12:35:16,2023,2,4,12,35,16

But life has a funny way of throwing curveballs, and I was hit with a few too many. I lost my job, my landlord raised the rent, and I couldn't seem to catch a break in finding a new job that paid enough to cover my bills. So, I made the heart-wrenching decision to move into my car. At first, it was supposed to be temporary, but as time went on, I realized I was in it for the long haul. Despite the struggles and the feeling of hopelessness that often creeps in, I try to focus on the positives and find small ways to make life bearable. It hasn't been easy, but I'm a survivor and I'll find a way to make it through.

Living in my car and facing the threat of homelessness has been one of the most difficult and emotional experiences of my life. Every day is a struggle, filled with feelings of fear, embarrassment, and uncertainty.

One of the biggest fears I face is the constant worry of being discovered and losing my car, which is also my home. Every night, I struggle to find a safe place to park where I won't be bothered or asked to move along. I often go without a good night's sleep because I'm always worried about being caught.

It's also a challenge to maintain my daily routine and keep up with personal hygiene while living in my car. It's not easy to find a private place to take a shower or use the restroom, and I often feel embarrassed when I have to go to a public place to do so.

The hardest part of all, however, has been trying to find a job. It's a catch-22 situation: I need a job to afford a place to live, but I don't have a stable address or phone number, which makes it difficult for potential employers to contact me. I feel discouraged and hopeless at times, like I'll never be able to escape this situation.

Despite these difficulties, I've tried to stay positive and keep searching for a way out of this situation. Recently I discovered survey apps, which have been a lifesaver for me. I can take surveys on my phone at any time, anywhere, and earn a little extra money. It may not seem like much, but it's made a huge difference for me. I can now afford small luxuries like a hot meal or a cheap gym membership, and I feel more in control of my situation. I found the app on tiktok and have used to it to pay for just about every meal since finding it. It's not much but it's something.

If you're facing similar challenges, know that you're not alone. It's a difficult journey, but with perseverance and determination, know that you can get through it.",2023-02-04 03:02:05,2023,2,4,3,2,5

Like, you might hike a few miles and suddenly you come upon a group of people giving away free hotdogs, burgers and beer or maybe you stop at a town along the trail and get a job chopping firewood for a few days in return for free room and board plus enough money to get some supplies.

I don't know if this is feasable as a lifestyle and I'm sure there are cold temps at certain times, bears, lions, crazies, etc. I also thought about the Blue Ridge Parkway. There are several different trails.",2023-02-03 19:12:19,2023,2,3,19,12,19

I've been staying at a cheap ass hostel that I'm able to stay at thanks to whatever savings i gathered from the english school days. Its safe, it is clean and i get one free meal a day! With luck, I'll be able to stay until mid March, maybe, but I'm still saving whenever I can.

Safe to say, I'm feeling distraught and anxious all the time, feeling literally sick all the time and out of options, If I had the courage, i would just tie a noose around my neck and be done with it, bu i guesd a part of me still hopes for the future! I don't know what to do really, It feels im back at the same spot i was 4 monyhs ago! 

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar personality disorder and treatment resistant depression (i think that's how is it called in English), so I'm trying to get financial aid, but that requires lawyers and time i don't have, sadly, its hard to get a lawyer for free in the public ministry of my country.

I'm working with a homeless charity on a project that helps to relieve the pressures of homelessness among the youth.  

I'm conducting research on young people aged 16-30 who have experienced homelessness before and would like to gain some insights into the experience of those who've been through this / are currently experiencing homelessness. 

If you or anyone that you know of has experienced homelessness / left home at a young age, could you please take 5 mins to fill out this short survey? The research will really help support this project and aid young people in finding housing when they are faced with hardships. 

**All answers given are strictly confidential and will remain anonymous.**

Ive recovered from that double pneumonia and hypoxia but it caused me to have a weakening immune system. My question is do I have any rights in this situation even though I'm not disabled by government standards? Do I have to leave if i get kicked out?

I am also under the impression that in order to stay in a shelter, you need to provide ID for whatever state you are seeking shelter in as well as undergo a background check. Same thing with food/clothing banks or other, similar services including public clinics.

So, in other words, lots of paperwork, proof of everything, a background check, ID for the state you are seeking services in and in order to get stamps, cash assistance, perm housing, etc, you need to prove that you have lived in that state for at least a year.

I guess the solution is to just hang out on the streets in some sketchy part of town (hoping you live through it) until your ""one year"" is up and then start looking for assistance?.

Please tell me I'm wrong and that it isn't as complex and difficult as I've just described.

10q1j9r,0,static48,5,homeless,*UPDATE ON ORIGINAL POST*,"First of all, I’d like to thank everyone who took the time to provide me with advice on how to move forward with my living situation with my husband and MIL. 

I am writing an update because there were too many replies to directly respond to. I understand that some might believe that this was not the right forum for me to be writing this on, but it doesn’t matter. Everyone has been so kind and helpful and that means more to me than being on the correct sub.

I know that the obvious thing to do would be to take my children and move out on my own. The issue I have with that is that since we sold that house for a loss and have zero savings, I don’t have much financial backing and I am afraid to go on my own. I know that my husband is paying his parents overhead but he does pay our other bills and for the appliances that we have in that storage unit. He is also paying for that storage unit that is holding our belongings.

I think that if I try to find a way to suck it up and stay a little longer at his parents house I will be able to save more of my own $ and I’ll be in a much better financial situation when I decide to get out. I don’t want to worry about how I am going to feed my kids without the $ from my husband. 

Any further suggestions would be much appreciated! Thank you again for the help and the love.",2023-01-31 08:13:48,2023,1,31,8,13,48

10plpdt,0,static48,9,homeless,Not homeless but feel like I am…long read!,"My husband and I never had any money. We still don’t. But we finally were able to save the money I had in my retirement account to purchase a house of our own. We have had to rent for our entire marriage (12 years) and we have been bounced around due to landlords wanting to sell the house, raising the rent, etc. We do live in a very HCOL area, but all of our family is here and we have small kids so we wanted to keep them altogether. Due to the fact that we couldn’t afford to “buy” a house in the area, we ended up buying one down south for way less money. We moved there and lasted a year, before I convinced my husband to sell it. Since we had no equity in it, we didn’t make any profit off of the sale and just paid back what we owed the bank. We had no money going into this, but due to extreme circumstances- we had to get out of there (my handicapped son and I got held up at gunpoint outside of his school there). I was traumatized from this event and said I need to go home to my family where it is safe. 

We left with no $ and no place to live. My husbands parents allowed us to stay with them, but told us it had to be short-lived and just long enough for us to save enough $ to find housing of our own. We have now been here for 6 months. By this time, you would think that we would have saved a large amount of $. But no. When I got here, my husband stated quite clearly that we cannot afford to live back here and that I need to look for jobs elsewhere. Well I found a job here and started it. I figured I might as well start working and saving as much $ as I possibly can. Then Christmas hit, and all of the $ I was making went all to the kids Christmas gifts. Starting in January, I changed my banking elections for my paycheck and started putting my paycheck into a separate account so that I can save SOMETHING. During all of this, I found out that my husband has been paying for his parents bills and expenses, and I was told that we would just be paying for their groceries. I told my husband that he should be paying his way and offering a small amount of rent per month but he said that he is taking care of “enough”. Yeah, I am sure you are! 6 months in and we haven’t saved a dime. 

When I discuss this with my husband, he tells me that he will live with his parents for as long as it takes to save enough $ to buy a house here. He refuses to get a cheaper rental so that we can have our own privacy. He says the only way he will move out of their house is if I agree to move to another state where he feels it is cheaper to live in. He also refuses to get any of our belongings (we have been living without our clothing and shoes and belongings now for 6 months) because he put it all in a storage unit in Florida because he “assumed” that is where we would end up living. NO MAN- that is where YOU wanted us to live.z I never agreed to that at all and after finally getting this guy to sell the house, I left the storage unit and moving truck up to him. This is where he puts all of our belongings. His answer to that is he felt that I would “change my mind” and agree to go there as he wanted. 

So I have been living here in these horrible conditions and I don’t have any of my clothes or stuff that my children need. I have to go to a thrift store weekly to buy clothes because we have none of our own. Not to mention, here are the other reasons for why I hate my life here: 

- [ ] My mother in law is the most disrespectful b*tch I have ever met in my life. We fight daily. To the point where she gets up and leaves the house and doesn’t come back until the next day. 
- [ ] I know where MY $ is going because I got smart and started putting it away. But my husband is using his paycheck to pay for their expenses, and allows his mother to treat me badly and tells me to just stop fighting with her. 
- [ ] My husband refuses to leave from these conditions unless I agree to move out of the state and he uses the storage unit as our hostage because he knows that we need it. He says that he doesn’t have any $ to get a moving truck to bring it back up here. 
- [ ] AGAIN- the mother in law is a b*TCH from HELL and my husbands answer to it all is to “just ignore her”.  How am I supposed to just ignore her when we are living in a 4x4 1200 sq ft ranch house with 1 bathroom and there is no place for me to go where there is privacy or I can get away from her. Bad enough I have to sleep with my kids because there is only one bed. My husband sleeps on the couch. 
- [ ] I am essentially paying their bills and not saving nearly as much as I thought we would be doing by staying here. But my husband won’t admit that he is doing so.
- [ ] I can’t even begin to go into the horrid living conditions that we have encountered living here. They haven’t updated their appliances in over 30 years. They have a septic system. The whole thing blew the first week we got here and shit was literally all over the house and yard. Then a month later, the pipes burst, causing us to be without water for days. I had to take a shower at my job which is in a hospital for 3 days. After that, their refrigerator blew. Went 4 days without any refrigeration of food that the food had to be left outside in the cold to be used as a refrigerator. A week after that? Their heater blew. Was then without heat for 3 days and that forced me to go to a hotel with my kids because it’s the winter in the northeast.
- [ ] Should I go on????  

I need HELP. I was trying my best not to break up my family and have my children go through a divorce but it looks like I have no other option. My parents have been telling me that I should leave and get an apartment on my own with the kids and leave him with his parents. Like I said, I have been trying to avoid all of that. But I can’t live here anymore. I am at the point where I am afraid for my mental health. And yes, I have tried to talk to my husband about all of it. His repeated answer is “you should have taken a job offer in those other states that were offering you $ and we would have had a place to live then”.

He says that if I want to live in this state then I need to live with his parents until we are able to save up enough $. I asked him how long of a timeline this would be and he said approximately one more year. I love my parents and my family and I don’t want to move away from them. But I also know that I can’t financially do this on my own and with all of this adversity, I was sincerely and genuinely trying to keep my family together. I just don’t feel like you should pick a place to live based off of a job offer. It should be the place you WANT to live, and to from there. We made the mistake of moving far away once before. I am trying to be smart this time around. 

It is all a mess. I hate my life and I hate living here. Please if anyone can help me, I would greatly appreciate it.",2023-01-30 19:31:41,2023,1,30,19,31,41

As we all know, homelessness is a growing issue affecting people across the world. The lack of stability and security can take a serious toll on a person's mental health. So, I wanted to ask the community, what are your thoughts on this issue?

How does the lack of a permanent home, basic necessities, and daily stressors of homelessness affect a person's mental wellbeing? Have you, or someone you know, experienced how severe the impact of homelessness can be on mental health?

Let's start a discussion and shed some light on the effects of homelessness on mental health. Your experiences and insights can help raise awareness and bring attention to this important issue.

I've been lurking this sub a lot and I have been getting tips on how to survive on the street from here. But that was before my husband decided to up and leave me out here alone in the woods in a tent with no way to survive. Became homeless  right before new years before we were staying with my family member who ended up moving someone in that was prostituting and bringing drugs in (I don't do drugs) and one of the men she brought in tried sexually assaulting me so that was the end of that. Well last night I started crying because I'm trying so hard to cope with the situation, and my husband got mad and we got into and he left. Long story short, he messaged me and said he found a way back to his hometown across the state and I'm on my own. He's been acting off but I didn't think anything of it, and now I'm wondering if he was planning to leave me out here. Now I'm stuck, afraid and not sure what to do. I contacted women's shelters and the only ones here are full at the moment, and I got myself on a waiting list for another organization for housing but it's a long wait. My dad said I can come stay with him but I have absolutely no way there, no Uber or bus ticket. He's disabled and can't come get me. I've thought about hitchhiking but very afraid since I'm a small petite woman with no way to protect myself. I do have a tent but I'm deathly afraid to be in woods alone at night because there are some really shady people around. I wasn't expecting this at all. I just need some words of encouragement. Some hope. Or even stories of escaping homelessness, so I too can have hope that there's a way. Thank you.

Can I get pros and cons about this

Edit: a lot of people are asking how these are going to be built. What a bout a shower and other stuff. I myself live in a trailer I don’t have the money to make luxury homes. When I say 6x6w 5t that’s pretty much it. The only thing it will have is insulation for warmth, a door to get inside, wheels to transport it and maybe a nice carpet for comfort. I don’t have thousands of dollars to make these it will be coming out of my own pocket.  

I don’t have money to hook up heating and plumbing especially if I don’t have heating in my place and most of MY plumbing doesn’t work. I’m not buying them solar panels or giving them fancy camping equipment because I simply don’t know who will sell it for drugs. 

I have a pretty good idea on who the homeless are in my area and which ones are trying to better themselfs because I give away free food everyday. I work at dominos and everyday I get our canceled orders and go around town handing out pizzas. I know most of the homeless will try and sell their tiny homes for drugs so they need to b as basic as possible. 

Per the California Residential Code, detached accessory structures that do not exceed 120 sq. ft. and do not contain plumbing, electrical, and/or mechanical equipment, do not require a building permit.  

Im conclusion they will not have heating pluming electricity or machanical equipment so they don’t need a permit

Edit #2: after a lot of research I found if they build it I won’t be liable for anything. And it kills two birds in one stone 1. Liability 2. Who gets one. If they don’t want to make it then they won’t get one (I will help so if they don’t have skills it doesn’t matter) and if they’re on drugs they won’t be able to focus enough to build it",2023-01-27 13:28:38,2023,1,27,13,28,38

10mfzs1,10,Aggressive-Resolve20,2,homeless,Still nothing new ... but also,"I was homeless or less than housed for 10 of the past 13 years. Never thought of reddit as anything helpful. 

Dad died, I broke my leg and lost my job. 8 months of rent issues and my mother's mental health issues and got evicted soon after. 

Before eventually using the city's shelter system, I had slept in my brother in laws car. Then moved to a cousin's small, filthy place upstate. After i couldn't handle that, an insufferable Christian couple accepted me into their home, in part of a state where without a car, you go nowhere. 

I still somehow found a way to get back into the city. 

Was there for about 4 weeks. And i think I started renting a room because I had recently at that time, received my workers comp settlement. Foolishly spending it off course, but while looking for work. All i was ever able to find, if they interviewed me at all, was 7.25 part time or seasonal. With a rent to pay, regardless the amount, part time at 7.25 was not enough. 

Ran out of money like 6 months later, living on that comp. Had to hit the shelters. 

Men's intake for a couple nights, then moved to another place. It was slow going finding work, at this point, any work. I took seasonals, stayed in the shelter and saved until I had enough to rent a room. 

There's an agency that rented rooms. Mostly old or somehow supposedly limited income folks, renting space through the agency. It could be a legit room. Or worst case, cut off living room space shared with another on a bunk, or a small bedroom shared with 2 others ... in separate beds at least. 

And throughout those 10 years, I've had troubles. Insufficient jobs, terrible living situations in and out of the shelter situations. 

Covid struck in 2019 and that has been my last experience with homeless. And these past 3 years are actually bright times. At some point while I was working in 2018-19, I was renting a room, until covid. Back into the shelter, where I got placed in a motel. Trust it wasn't glamorous at all, all the same shit. 

But i was collecting unemployment and the stimulus payments. Was able to save a few thousand. Shelter decides to move me to another one shortly before I'm able to move on my own. Bc boss tell me he can let me stay, he actually expected his failed business to pick up soon. It never did. 

My old boss allowed me to stay in an apartment he had available. I bought some furniture and decorating stuff. But this was also at the end of my unemployment, so I was working with what I had saved. 

While i was there for a year or so, I stayed looking for work. My way of doing things hadn't changed. But again, as typical, shit wasn't easy. 

Ended up leaving that apartment after cutting all with the old boss and job. And was paying storage for my shit. And this was just about a week or so before or after I found what ended up being a decent job. Old boss soon sold the business and retired. 

So, I paid 2 months storage, looking for Apts or roommate situations. I was done with renting rooms from strangers. I wanted that, ""this my place"" feel. Not that I don't want to be here feel. 

I stayed at a friend's apt for the little bit it took for me to find my new apt. Like a month. 

So i find my new apartment out of state because the job I did get, moved. But until I found it, I was doing a long commute. 

Rented a room again I think if I remember correctly. I can't recall the exact timeline. But i do remember going from where to where and approximately when. 

I left the basement apt in January or February of 21, started working in March. Was paying storage, rented a room until November 21

For about a month, I can't recall when, maybe it was soon after I left, I was still looking at other housing options, no shelter. Likely before March of 21, I briefly stayed at a friend's place. Started renting a room soon as I picked up work. 

Stayed in the city, as the job was there. Stayed looking for an apt. No luck. 

My job moved in September of 21. I had enough saved in that 7 months, I found a place in another 2. I moved in my new place for work, in November of 21. 

Then my job started fucking with me. String me along with false promises, pull the rug. Keep me at bottom tier, but decent pay if I made 40+. They cut my hours after having the apt for only 3 months. I'm struggling. I'm looking for a second job. 

6 months later and I'm not finding a second job, but this one still tightens me. Then I lost my job in December of 22...I have, no fall back, no fail safe. No job. Just anxiety. 

But I've been through it, so I know I can go through it. Get that unemployment, and soon find work. 

Glad i found work again when I did. As it's been more than a month since I applied for unemployment, my money I had saved a little of ran out, and I haven't gotten the unemployment yet. 

But i know I'll get it eventually, and it'll hit when I start working, get my tax refund, and start a second job. 

I'll be fine. 

I found the next job. I have interviews lined up for a second job. I have the unemployment backpay, and the tax refunds. I don't have shit to worry about. 

I feel like I've gotten through the worst part of it. And all I actively did was look for work to afford a room. Just to get me out of the shelters. And even though 25% of the rooms I've rented weren't the most hospitable, I did what I had to. And I'm better off for it. 

If i had the data plan back then to go on reddit, and read the advice and question, the concern, I think I would have had a better understanding instead of basically winging it as I feel I have been.",2023-01-27 01:28:14,2023,1,27,1,28,14

I started out with a good amount of money for an apartment ($5K+), but the housing crisis has proven to be much more of a challenge than I anticipated. I've written a lot about this phenomenon so I won't elaborate further but, in a nutshell, it's near-impossible to qualify for even a shitty apartment under these circumstances. Every listing on the Big Five (rental apps) has hundreds of competing applicants, as well as extremely difficult requirements. Managers can (and are) being extremely picky about who they're allowing in. Only the perfect are allowed now, but they don't mind taking your application fee.

I've spent most of my funds staying in cheap motels while I apply for apartments all around the Valley. I could've spent a lot of those evenings sleeping in my car, but the freezing temperatures and rain were too much for my aging body and my cats. I never imagined that I would still be looking (and hemorrhaging funds) a month later.

I no longer have enough money to get an apartment, so I must shift my thinking to buying a minivan or small RV with the remaining $3,000. My big fear is that I'll get burned and end up with a lemon, wasting the last remaining resources I have. How do I know the fair market value, which models should I trust, and so on?

The public seems to have this image that 25% of homeless are generally smart men who choose this lifestyle, refuse help, become a nuisance, and commit crimes to have a warm place to sleep on extra cold nights. 

Then they feel that 25% of homeless are drug users, the ones that the news shows like walking zombies. 

Another 25% are mentally ill, but dangerous. Throwing feces, robbing, commit dangerous crimes, etc. 

Another 10% veterans, perhaps, but who refuse help, safe but a burden to others. 

Maybe 15% are mothers and children; who are reaping what they sow by having so many kids and choose to be dropouts. 

Am I missing anyone? The stigma is wrong. Homelessness has so many more people. People just don’t think. The problem is I don’t have any solid statistics to back me up. Any links?

Though it was only for I think, I'm not sure because when you're out on the street, you go by seasons... temperatures so. So it was during the Summer and lasted until when it started getting warm again.

The best advice I can give my Brothers and Sisters of the Streets.. Never give up on hope, stay true to your beliefs. Ask before anything else. Don't blame anyone else, especially yourself. And no matter what..'Have manners'. Thank you, yes, no, excuse me. I was homeless, but I became a different type and kind of homeless.

Back when I was growing up in the 60's people weren't called homeless, they were called a Bum. So I became a Bum. When I was young, I respected The Bum(s) in my neighborhood, on my block. My mother and father did, so I HAD to. They called us by names, they knew us. I never seen my parents actually talking to any of them, so I questioned how did they know I names. Because they LIVED on the streets. I would never see them at night, during holidays or when there was a snow storm or when it was raining cats & dogs. Other than that, they became a fixture. Sanitation trucks, garbage trucks...this was the era of the metal garbage cans, building being heated by coal in the winter time. The Bums would sweep up what the garbage truck dropped in the streets. After coal is burned, it's the ash and that has to be collected too. They would help those collectors by bringing the spent coal cans closer to the truck and then cleaning up after the workers dumped the cans..handing Bums $1..which was a while lot in the late 60's. So if I was to survive being in the streets of where I was homeless at, I had to make myself useful. And that I did.

Started with helping people, women with just when they came downstairs to throw garbage away, I would take it and I'll do that. And they would say thank you, me: No problem. Then women looking out side their windows .'Hey you, can you go to the store for me?' Throwing money out the window wrapped in paper. Go to the store and bring back their items and their change. I would always return it even after they say keep it. Then I was offered taking showers, then sleeping inside their apartment by the door with a blanket. Indie that once. They offered, but they were still Shakey about me sleeping inside, so they would stay up all night. Then I wasn't homeless any more. Went to my mother's house and that was that.

I started working, but knew I wanted more out of life. I'm a Cook, well I was. MY mother passed away, and I left NYC for upstate NY packed bag and my laptops. Found a place and a job the same night sitting in The bus station. No money in my pocket, so how did I find a place to stay? A woman came in to use the bathroom, and since I got off the bus, they had to give me the key, I was a paying customer. When she came out, she said thank you and ask me what was I doing and I told her. She said she has a 4 bedroom home with just her, and for $500 a month she'll give me a room. I told her I start a job, told who it was with and she said she knew them, the business. She said I won't charge you until starting the next month. This was the 12th if the month presently. Stayed with her for 2 years and left for Charlotte, NC.

Real fast now.. Charlotte, men's shelter, got place, stayed for 2 years, wanted to go some place else, but not NYC.. Pittsburgh, homeless on the streets while working for 3 weeks, paid hotel room cleaners $20 to take quick shower every 2, 3 days, worker told me about a room, stayed for 2 years, back to NYC, shelter for Veterans, working, got apartment, Pandemic, no work, not paying rent, saved up $60, Virginia, shelter, working, offered Section 8 thru Veterans Administration, accepted, moved in July last year.

But being how it happened, and I'm not being a  predator. If a woman I see on the streets are homeless, I offered hera 3 night stay, but if I leave, she has to leave but can come back. I wash her clothes, she can eat anything and how much she wants providing she washes her hands first. Take a shower as often as she wants, soak in my CLAW FOOTED BATHTUB! For as long as she wants. That's my giving back. I won't do it for guys, because I trust them and I will fall asleep. But with women, I force myself to stay up because I don't trust them. Yeah stuff have been taken, earbuds, a couple of laptops..but it is what it is. I dont get mad because I was GIVEN a Section 8 Voucher. So I'm looking out, I'm doing my part for being thankful and grateful. 

But I'm afraid, afraid that at any minute all this will be taken away from me. Believe it or not, I'm more afraid than when I didn't have. I'm 62 and my body is going thru changes, it's getting old and worn out. I don't go anywhere, I don't do anything. I spend my time reading, on the internet, learning to use a DJ Controller, make my own music, learned Adobe Animate. And wait for SS check every month. It bothers the fuck out of me to hear what people go thru on here from those that have..have a roof over their head..able to be warm from the elements outside. To just exhale and sleep. I know what it feels like to have all that stress and tension in your neck muscles. I know what it feels like to have your feel sore and hurting from constantly moving from one place to another. If not having anyone to talk to.. or go 4  days and realize you haven't spoken a single word to anyone including yourself. And hungry, hunger. To be hungry is the worst feeling in the world. But to eat after not eating for 3 days is also the worst feeling because the. Your stomach cramps up and not too many places will let you use their bathroom. So you go where you can, and clean yourself as best as you can.

People with homes...a corner in thier apartments, houses with basements... People should be given an incentive to take in screened homeless people and get paid by the Federal Government. Each Homeless person she have have an ID with a number where they can be tracked for safety purposes only. Are told where they can go for the night, 2 nights, 3 nights to...get a shower, hot meal and able to sleep over night. Be in by a certain time and out by a certain time..with a hot breakfast. Of course those providing all of this, are and will be paid by the Federal government, but they took, SCREENED AND FINGERPRINTED.

They are opening Section 8 again. You would think so. All these homes built and no one to live in them. People are losing out on their investments. Wait, the homeless, they have something we have and they need.. No, no, NO my friend, my property owner, you want to be my landlord. I, being Homeless with a HUD VASH Voucher, Housing Choice Vouchers and Section 8 Voucher... I have something YOU NEED...ME!!",2023-01-26 12:12:30,2023,1,26,12,12,30

The individuals not in the room but at the center of the discussion were what the meeting organizer, Chris Drummond, described as a subset of Boulder’s unhoused population that are “high-utilizers.” Chief of Police Maris Herold later added that these high-utilizers were “wreaking havoc” on Boulder’s residents and city services.

-if you dumpster dive, hit the recycling bins because you can find cardboard and often times styrofoam. Layer these (styrofoam first, then cardboard) this will help retain warmth. 
-once tent is up, insulate walls. If you can get you hands on blankets they work well, wool works awesome- cover entire tent with tarp to repellent water. 
-if you can get your hands on a small bail of hay or wood chips, lay on bottom against ground, then cardboard. 
If you can insulate with one method for floor and one for walls and it's not an excessively large tent, you can heat it from a small candle and retain heat once candle is out. 
-layers! Dress in layers. Cotton, woolblend or alternative, cotton or water repellant clothes.

I am also a domestic abuse victim, and I don't have any of my legal documents like my birth certificate & SSN and it's rly making everything feel impossible.

I'm editing this post bc it wasn't well-worded. I was tired when I published. Mainly my question was geared toward how homeless persons have been treated by cops, in their personal experience.

As for Officer Noname, we talked a bit and he said he's been in my shoes. Homeless. And he added, he had a drinking problem at that time. But then met a fine Christian woman, got married, became a cop, and settled down.

To be clear; For the record: I was NOT homeless because I had a drinking or drug problem. And as for marrying a fine Christian woman who keeps me on the straight and narrow... lol that ain't gonna work out well for me or for her. But I am happy it worked out well for Officer Noname.

At home, there were always the bills to pay, pets to feed (and vet bills), groceries to buy and the constant stream of never-ending daily chores/repairs. It was just a daily grind of the same old things every day and it would get super-old after awhile.

Living on the streets or vagabonding gave me a sense of freedom and adventure. One day I might be standing in line for free donuts and coffee and the next day I might be having a beer with some random dude on a shrimp boat. No day...hour...or even minute was ever the same and I had no responsabilities. Of course, the cops can harrass you or you might have trouble finding a ride or a place to stay at various times but I always loved sitting down over a cup of coffee, looking at a paper map and trying to decide where my next great adventure was going to be.

10jknbk,11,SlyNoBody337,62,homeless,Homelessness is a choice for many but not for me,"I made other choices that ultimately landed me here on the street. I was in the work force, I was comfortable at times, and in the interest of my health, my time, my future I chose to jump forward into being a full time student of yoga, without any personal teacher or tutor of my own. 

Every day that goes by someone comes along blabbing about homelessness being a choice, that I need to 'get the fuck off the steet man' and I now feel terrible that I ever let anyone in on this myself. Because I was homeless by choice as a drug addict at 14. And it was different. 

I almost never meet other homeless people with their heads screwed on. Sometimes I'm afraid they're dead, but I realize most of them went through years of turmoil before finally getting an alignment of decisions and circumstance which carry them all the way out. 

Ive been through treatment for my mild disorder. Which is BPD and General Anxiety + Chronic Depression. 

At 17 I got to a point in treatment where I was informed clearly, all I had left to do was take what I learned and move on with it. Other things can be tried in terms of technique, but the ones I've found that are effective on people dealing with mild but chronic addictions are just inaccessible. Joe Dispenza has a great program, but it costs so fucking much. You have to have a terminal illness to send in for free tickets

There are others who have proven solutions for depression that cant be put behind you with any obvious lifestyle change. But it costs crazy money. 

I can't even share space as a worker with most other people. Im still a full time student of yoga, so when I go into work I am a full time student of yoga. I'm not a regular dude who wants to go out for drinks, I don't have any method for absorbing bullshit all day and excreting it as rainbows. And overall my journey with yoga is for me to overcome not only the mental but also many physical issues I deal with. That means if I have back issues while working, I'm not going to push further. I've had compressed discs during adolescence and later. It hurts like hell and the more it happens the more dangerous it is. 

I will stop whatever I am doing, give or take a few minutes to do some yoga. That applies to my Jnana Yoga too, so when things get mentally unmanageable I am not pushing any harder for you or your business. I have to go meditate, or write. I have been struggling with suicide all my life. Putting myself in situations that worsen that feeling. Changing my response past a point will put me out of touch with myself. Although I do adjust my attitude for the better wherever possible


And more. It's cold as fuck. I usually dont wear socks and I have on slips to avoid toe fungus. It's too much to constantly use foot spray and carry around nasty old socks. Washing them proactively doesn't help either where laundry costs 7 dollars a load here. Yet people will still look at you like you are the asshole for doing the right thing for yourself. 

That look is so distinct. It starts with an 'ugh who are you' look and extends to an 'youve been here for 6 months and I still don't see your drugs WHERE IS THE DRUGS'

And they hide it behind stupid questions like 'why don't you just get a place' 'why not just get a job' 'whats going on with you?' and when it's not the answer they want or expect, they forget what I say and repeat the next day. 80% of conversations end with 'Oh. Ok.'

I stay in Frisco because of its accessibility to services but that doesn't mean that Frisco is ending homelessness. It's easy ish to get a place if you are local to the Tenderloin or the Mission. But I mean, really local or you need an in. 

North Beach Citizens which is nearest to me, told me they just are not interested in helping me because they have other priorities. 

I'm fairly certain I'm gonna die somewhere in the midst of this, with the people who run rampant at night and how much they choose to bother me. I don't look particularly jacked up, so most people assume I am hiding money drugs or both.

It's fucked up. If there was a delete button for 'assumptions people made about homelessness' I would just press it regardless of anybody's free will. The shit is ridiculous and the world looks even more bleak with the amount of nonsense being perpetuated on the net. 

No, help is not available for just anyone. No it does not work that way. Every program is different. I get state benefits and have MediCal, but I can't get ERAP to move on my fucking case to get me into a place. No matter what I do. It's been 6 months of that and even longer just being homeless generally

There's no point here and I wish that more people could see there's very little point to the struggles of homeless people. Like I saw someone else mention the cause of homelessness is not actually drugs it's lack of housing / funding. Drugs inspire voluntary homelessness for sure but that doesn't make everyone on the street a meth user

In so many cases we don't have that funding or housing because of the disgusting spitefulness of our chosen elites on the national level. All of whom believe far worse things about homeless people than most every day folk. And yet will lie to their death bed about it, thus making the situation worse. I don't give a fuck who wants votes or approval I'm feeling like punching the TV when I hear people say 'all people deserve housing. We are going to end homelessness.'

Motherfucker. No you aren't, you're going to do an end homelessness media campaign and then take the clout elsewhere. As soon as it gets worse again, the meek will be blamed for it. Up to whatever the breaking point is where everyone loses their shit altogether

10jc0na,9,filthygingersnap,9,homeless,I don't even know where to begin,"Hey y'all. This may be a long post so buckle in.  Last Wednesday, my daughter, my two doggerinas, and I were booted from our apartment after I had been trying for months to avoid this from happening.

Long story kinda short, I work at a psychiatric hospital, and a few months ago I was assaulted by one of my patients, leaving me with severe head trauma, slipped disks in my cervical spine, and a bunch of other neat stuff. After being out of work for some time, my job brought me back on light duty, with a severe reduction of hours. I was hanging on there for a while, barely able to cover all of my bills, but I basically tapped out of my savings around October. 

Back around Novemberish I got hooked up with a volunteer organization that helps homeless vets. They said that they'd help me get caught up with my rent. Cool. Unfortunately the approval process was slower than slow and I just kept getting more and more behind on my rent. I kept my landlord updated on the process as much as I could, but I still ended up having to go to court a week before Christmas. My caseworker FINALLY got approval for my rent assistance, but then my landlord decided to drag their feet with sending the proper paperwork from their end. Two weeks ago, my caseworker sent my assistance checks in the mail, and forwarded promissory notes and scanned copies of the checks to my landlord. I thought everything was figured out so I spent my last check getting caught up on bills. Then Tuesday morning my door gets practically beaten down by a sheriff and six other cops. 

My landlord told me that since the checks didn't arrive by Monday that I was forced to vacate. They said it didn't matter that the checks got delayed in the mail or that they were dated before their ""deadline"" that they never told me about. Basically said ""sucks to suck"". They told me I had seven days to get my things but they wouldn't even let me in the apartment at all last week. 

I'm so scared. Kiddo and the pups and I have been bouncing around Airbnbs and hotels since. My daughter's friend's parents offered to let her stay with them for a few weeks so that's a blessing. But I'm so overwhelmed. Now I have an eviction on my credit so no one will rent to me. My caseworker is just as puzzled as I am that the apartments refused the money. I have to call her today to find out if she has any next steps. This still feels like a horrible dream.

Does it get any easier? Sorry for the ramble. My brain is soup right now.",2023-01-23 06:04:36,2023,1,23,6,4,36

10ilegi,6,thelink225,60,homeless,How stupid would it be of me to try to build a temporary shelter with the snow?,"So, in a couple of days, I get evicted from my hotel, and I'm back on the streets of Denver. The city has been really gung-ho about cracking down on camping all of a sudden, and it's made it virtually impossible to find anywhere to sleep. We've also got a ton of snow on the ground right now, and ice on the roads, which is going to make navigating the already terrible sidewalks even worse with my cart of belongings. I'm not really sure how I'm going to handle this.

However, as I was waking up this morning, in that state between being asleep and being awake where I tend to have my best and worst ideas, a thought popped into my head. Could I maybe camouflage my tent by building a pile of snow over it? I remember building snow forts as a kid, and I've got a reasonable idea of how to do it. I would still need to build it in a relatively out of the way place where it wouldn't stand out to people, but I was thinking that MAYBE, since the weather is going to stay cold for weeks, this might give me somewhere to lay low and tell the melt off begins. And then, once things start to melt, I can start working my way toward the edge of the city to try and find somewhere that I can get away with camping a bit easier. There is a park nearby that has some nooks and crannies I MIGHT stand a tiny chance of getting away with this in.

10i4f2r,9,ratcheer,25,homeless,PLANNING on homelessness in SF? Where to start?,"TL;DR Looking for info on how to move into a vehicle in SF, and not go completely insane. 

Longer:

I have a decent job in San Francisco, but am on the edge financially. Debt, etc. 

Also, I am in a horrible marriage that is fundamentally abusive (verbally/emotionally). Not going into details here that's just my situation. 

We live in a house (owned, but mortgage), but I sleep in our daughter's old room, along with junk stored there. All ""my"" stuff - to the extent that stuff defines a life - is packed away. My role there is essentially to be a barely tolerated sidekick, agreeing to every decision, there to be criticized/attacked whenever she's in a bad mood (which is often). The fact that I've endured this for years is my own fault I know. 

I'm just saying the above for context. Please don't give me relationship advice! Been there, ONLY blows up in my face. If anyone suggests ""talking to her"" I will block them. It took me many years, but I know beyond a doubt I have to simply act for myself, and a solution isn't going to fall from the sky. 

So, I had the crazy idea: find a suitable/affordable vehicle (or use my Honda Fit but it's hella small), and hang with those RV mobs I see by SF State and other locations. 

At LEAST I can play music without bothering others, or go to the bathroom (probably in a bucket) without getting a report card on how someone was inconvenienced. There's an affordable gym near work for showers etc. 

And either drive or take public transportation to work (Civic Center). 

There MUST be people who've done this, are doing it, right? Even older people (60's) like me?

So I'm mainly just looking where to *start* looking. What have people done already? Are there subreddits? Blogs? Community?

I KNOW this is a terrible idea, but I'm barely hanging on here, and I need to do SOMETHING different.

He did time in prison, but has apparently been living in an abandoned shed since getting out 4 years ago. He has been completely sober for over 3 years and hasn’t missed a day of work. He is a senior gentleman as well. I have already reached out and met with a housing organization in our county and he is now enrolled in a program that is helping him find a suitable place. He also has an advocate who he gave me permission to work with as well. The advocate says since he’s high functioning, he will likely be expedited. Even so, his advocate doesn’t expect him to be able to find suitable housing for another 3-6 months. We are in Ohio and it’s cold. I personally put him in a hotel for a week and have given him a few food gift cards. What else can I do for him for the time being? He has a difficult time navigating computers and researching help. I’ve also enrolled him in our employee assistance program, and he’s in therapy once a week. I let him use my office, close the door and I leave alone for his sessions. I give him ride to and from his shed as often as I can. I have also ordered him a new birth certificate. Once it comes in we are getting him a state ID and a new social security card as well. I’m working on expunging his convictions as well, but it’s a long and complicated process. I also gave him 2 large bins of warm, gently used clothing. He’s currently using a propane heater. I guess some specific questions -

He needs a bicycle. Does anyone have any recommendations? He also wishes he had equipment to be able to cook.

Back in July I was sleeping in my friend’s car and jumping over pool gates to use the shower. I became homeless because I tried to report a co-worker harassing me when I was working at the casino. The surveillance would have proved me right but Human Resources called me and fired me… probably because she worked at the company a lot longer and had family members working there too. If I had known I was going to be fired, I would have kept my mouth shut and allowed the harassment… I begged for them to separate us and keep my job and they told me I could reapply in the future but I knew they were not going to re hire me for whistle blowing her. Anyway, homelessness can happen to anyone. I was living in a friend’s car because I didn’t have a car. Went to Starbucks and libraries for internet to apply to jobs during the daytime. I eventually got a job and started to team up with someone down on his luck and we shared a room at motel 6, both working. Now we have allowed another homeless person to move in with us and we got a slightly bigger room at a different hotel that has a kitchen and a closet. It takes sacrifice and a lot of days were frustrating. Sacrifice of privacy too… anyway I paid all my bills yesterday and it feels good to have $165 to last me 2 weeks til my next paycheck. 
For a lot of people $165 is scary to survive on but for me and the past 7 months I have had less than $15 in my pocket at all times. Living off bread, noodles, rice and top ramen… 
Obviously I should be on food stamps but I didn’t have a mailing address and I don’t know if I qualify because I have a Nevada license but now living in California…  I guess I just came here to say 3 heads are better than 1. 
Housing is so damn expensive and I definitely don’t get along with one of my roommates but that motivates me to work more and stay out of the room. I was in a dark depression thinking I would never going to have a normal life again and yea it’s not normal to share a room with 2 people but today is the first day of being happy in a long time. 
While living in the motel 6 I still felt homeless because every 28 days I’d have to move out… 
3 days ago moved into an extended stay which has more room and a kitchen and feels like an apartment.

I have been fortunate enough to be in a hotel for a while, and through some of the worst cold we've dealt with this winter so far, but that's likely to change soon. When I was out on the street before, I was starting to have serious problems with sweat building up in my clothes and making me cold — as well as condensation building up on the inside of my tent, sometimes quite a lot of it so that my stuff gets wet. I dress in layers, but that just seems to trap the condensation inside my clothes all the more, and I don't really have any place to change or air them out when I'm out on the street.

How do you all deal with this? Any tips? I plan to buy a new tent very soon, and I currently have a little bit of money to invest in better clothing and gear if I know what to get and where to get it. Now soliciting advice.",2023-01-20 13:34:09,2023,1,20,13,34,9

One of my other friends is helping him get an apartment by spending her hard earned money for a first months rent. It's great that she's blessing him, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of money herself. Not to mention he has his ID and everything he needs to start working.
My concern is that he's going to try and take advantage of her and mooch or he's just going to sit around doing nothing until he finally needs a job and ends up losing his apartment. It's always good to at least have some money to get somewhere instead of depending on people who aren't obligated to help you. I've tried to convince him to get a job where I work because it's nearby his parents house which he's temporarily living in rn, but he doesn't seem interested. Any thoughts?

Should I just be real with him and tell him how what he's doing isn't substanable or just let him make his own mistakes? I've told him this before.",2023-01-20 13:26:03,2023,1,20,13,26,3

I’ve been denied disability after being accused of dumping barely any money I received from my separation, I’ve spent months going over every resource I know about to not get to this point, and now I have to start figuring out how to get out of this house and hope it doesn’t get anymore hostile here in the mean time. I’ve been “homeless” most of my life, but I’ve always had somebody, even if they’re not trustworthy to crash with.

I have met other people in my situation and talked with locals who try to help. I feel like there's a gap that could be bridged with something like a discord server so that solutions could be communicated in real time, directly between those who need it and those who provide it. I think it could also open more honest communication and facilitate better understanding of what is *actually* needed on a larger scale (like regionally).

I spoke to a newish group that I came across through facebook this week. I mentioned my idea and they sounded pretty interested. Honestly, they've been the only charitible group that has been open to listening and adapting. So, I really think this general idea has the possibility of succeeding and really changing the way things are... at least around my area.

I'm wondering though, if anyone else has had an online forum succeed and if so, can I get a link for some guidance? Or, if you've thought about something similar, what kind of topics did you want to include? And, for anyone thats discord savvy, how do I set this up to be safe and make sense to users? I'm sure it would need to be highly moderated and submissions would have to be formatted... but what rules should be added/ avoided?

Tia for your input!

Edit to add: any general info on waivers or how to approach local businesses about how they could help would be great. I feel like many places don't want overnight parkers bc of insurance liability and maybe there is room for a liability waiver paired with terms of use? Also, just getting permission is one thing but then the cops roll up bc night shift and day shift dont communicate so having a blank form to show who said it was ok would be on my priority list. So is there a freebie site for customized  like this? Of course I'd be discussing things with local pd (bc, Shockingly, ours are understanding and actually try to help within their limitations).",2023-01-20 08:49:40,2023,1,20,8,49,40

How do you deal with being elderly as a homeless person?. I would think a warm climate and a decent shelter with the long-term goal of getting stable housing and decent medical care.

No more drug tests to stay in a halfway house or transitional housing (I've had a few beers, drinking wasn't what destroyed me) and I had false positives when I was on probation and almost wound up in prison...

I as I got things together was afraid it would all fail because one of the crazies in the building both residents and staff would corner me and I would need to defend myself. 

This is not bragging, but I clawed out and make good money now, more than the average in the us...  

I saw so many give up and think it would never get better...

This shelter is one of two branches of a homeless shelter, and the main umbrella organization is a nonprofit, the property I'm at has 'Christian' in the name and is supposed to be religious based.

Does anyone have any advice for how I might be able to get my cats a little more emotionally used to me being gone before the move out happens? I’m worried it will be really overwhelming for them. I think they have separation anxiety because even when I go downstairs to use the kitchen (I’m only allowed to have them in my room since I was sharing a home), they bang on the bedroom door and meow loudly for at least 20 mins. 

They’re also both really affectionate and want snuggles and pets every day all day, but they don’t really trust anyone else. Especially the boy cat, it took years to get him to snuggle with me.

Would it be idiotic to take that 1100 check and invest in getting me and my dog the fuck out of here? My only family is throwing me out to the cold, after stealing money from me for a deposit on their new house. I have no ties here, one friend with enough on his plate from taking care of his family and that's it.

Is there any advice anyone can give me on this?",2023-01-17 07:21:41,2023,1,17,7,21,41

I’ve done my research for some time and have found a few favorites but I’m open to suggestions. 
New Hampshire is maybe a 3 hour drive from me, great economy, jobs, opportunities, no sales tax, it is however pretty cold right now so that’s a factor
Colorado is something I’ve been dreaming of for years. I’ve heard it’s not like anywhere else. I love nature and the mountains. It’s overcrowded, cold, expensive, but I’ve also heard Colorado has some of the best programs for the homeless
Washington state has a lot of amazing opportunities. Everyone I know that’s been there all tell me it’s beautiful and I’d love to start my new life on the opposite side of the map.

10d1jc2,9,405freeway,5,homeless,"""I Live on the Balcony"" - Part 2","Despite the divorce, the biggest reason I came back to Los Angeles was for work. 

When I left for Florida last January I was the #1 handyman/mover on Taskrabbit. My rate was $125/hour (plus tips), and even working just 1 or 2 hours a day I was able to get by. I didn’t stress out. I could spend most of my days running, skateboarding, editing videos, cooking, and just riding the train somewhere. I could be creative during the downtime. I didn’t have to take on every client request I received.

In Tampa, I could barely charge $60 and get any sort of demand. I averaged less than one client a month. My work life imploded as soon as I got there, and my marriage suffered because of it. I couldn’t find consistent work in the industry I knew, and with so many projects and contractors involved in renovating the house we had bought, I couldn’t commit to a traditional 9 to 5. When we broke up in May, I was certain I could get back to Los Angeles and rebuild. 

That didn’t happen.

Upon my return in October, I discovered the entire Taskrabbit platform was suffering nationwide. Demand was down by 90% for some people, despite impeccable 5-star reviews and reasonable rates accounting for inflation and rising gas prices. Clients were no longer paying. Taskrabbit denied any sort of drop in demand, but talk amongst Taskers said otherwise. The company encouraged everyone to lower their rates, even though doing so hurt the bottom line of both the company and the contractors. If we made less, they made less, and Taskers were encouraged into bidding wars with each other.

The gig-economy and on-demand service industry was not the same one I had left. Covid had finally caught up with us.

I’ve averaged two clients a month since being back. Of course, that’s ignoring the unrealistic requests like hoisting a pre-built king-sized bed frame up to a second-story balcony. Some times clients are just insane.

I signed up for Central Casting, but the few callbacks I’ve gotten were for locations in Simi Valley and Castaic- places where I would end up making $40 for 8-hours of work after paying for the gas to get there and back. My tattoos also seem to limit me to being typecast as a construction worker, biker, lumberjack, and MMA fighter. Tattoos are distracting to the audience if they aren’t on a main character. Still, no ragrets.

I also took a job as a bouncer at a bar I loved, but at some point I hit on the wrong person on my day off. It paid terribly and had terrible hours, and the tips were insulting ($7/night on average), but at least it reminded me why I hate the corporate work environment. Policy and protocol and the employee handbook say one thing, but it doesn’t matter if you’re in an at-will state because you can be fired at anytime. So I was.

I’m not sure if any of my coworkers even knew I was homeless. I mentioned staying with friends and sleeping in my truck several times, but I never explicitly told them why.

I think I have PTSD from the house renovations. I’d rather be homeless in Los Angeles than a homeowner in Florida. Maybe I’m finally understanding the mentality of a large part of the homeless population.

Back to job-searching for now.",2023-01-15 18:40:39,2023,1,15,18,40,39
10cyewx,3,veryberryblue,6,homeless,Any tips for staying safe (west coast)?,"I've been thinking about, asking/talking about, reading about and watching videos about homelesness on the west coast lately. Probably even a little too much!.

I see the rows and rows of tents. I read about the daily thefts, assaults, feces, drugs, needles all over the place, etc. Not exactly my idea of a fun time and yet, it seems like the west coast is always in the news and people tend to flock there because of all the social services, weather, beaches and the care-free lifestyle.

I'm mainly talking about San Diego, San Francisco and other cities in Cali. I've watched a lot of videos about people who were really down on thier luck, went out west and were super happy there. They talk about getting free motel rooms, free money, eating like kings or queens, getting free medical/dental care, hanging out all day with thier buddies and getting drunk, cops being pretty chill, etc. I mean, I have to be honest...it does sound pretty tempting for someone who is totally down on thier luck but...

How do you stay safe?. I wouldn't want to live in a shelter with a bunch of violent people, bedbugs, etc and the thought of staying in a tent and getting awakened at 3:00AM by some tweaker with a machete isn't exactly appealing either. Any first steps to take when, for example, you arrive in San Diego or San Francisco and how do you get help and stay safe and avoid all (or most) of the bad/sketchy stuff?.",2023-01-15 16:25:19,2023,1,15,16,25,19

10cox2e,68,tuggyforme,36,homeless,The man-hamster.,"All species of animals are born with the nature-given freedom to gather and eat food. The freedom to drink from streams and rivers, and the freedom to sleep where they please.

All animals have this freedom. But it is taken away from humans. We are not allowed to hunt or fish (without expensive license and too many limits to survive on), we re not allowed to start a fire to cook, we are not allowed to gather fruits and vegetables anywhere legally, and all edible plants and trees have been purposely removed from public spaces. Hell we aren't even allowed to bathe or drink from rivers and streams because they've either been fenced off, diverted into pipes, or polluted by for-profit industries. OR it has simply been deemed as not-allowed, and you can be punished for trying.

Squirrels, mice, birds, deer, and other wild animals still can... they can eat and drink anything they see outdoors, and can sleep anywhere they want. But not humans. Humans have been purposefully limited/imprisoned in their world. This is true all over the world, in almost all societies.

Considering we are being actively and purposefully limited/imprisoned in our own world, those who are responsible for our status must provide us with alternative sources of food. If they do not, then this is tantamount to cruelty or torture.

It's like keeping a hamster locked up in a cage.. or a cat locked up in your house. once you take responsibility for this animal by locking them up and away from their natural food source, you BECOME RESPONSIBLE for feeding them. NOT feeding them would be cruel torture. Leaving them outdoors, chained to a rope in your yard when it is freezing out would also be torture. It would be considered Animal Abuse, and the owner would literally go to jail for it.

Humans are no different. Domesticated humans in a domesticated society wherever every aspect and food source is tightly controlled MUST BE FED. They MUST BE HOUSED. This is not an option. This is a ETHICAL REQUIREMENT on us, the society that actively enforces this environment.

The responsibility falls 100% on those in charge to give them access to food and housing. This is not a favor. This is not altruism. This is not self entitlement. This is not ""asking others to help.""

This is the caged hamster, stuck in a cage, waiting to be fed by those that put him in that cage.

This is BASIC HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY.

Some people claim, that if you didn't withhold food and shelter from humans, that they would not want to work or do anything to contribute to society. That's Nonsense. There are endless ways to incentivize people to work, be creative, and be productive. Too many to list. Love, admiration, fame, dreams, ideas. Nevermind plain old cash money and all the things it buys. Luxury cars, travel all over the world, vacation resorts, etc etc... but using FOOD and SHELTER, or the THREAT of HUNGER and COLD/DANGER as a bargaining tool or motivator to get people to do what you want them to do, is simply unethical. The lowest form of humanity. This affects EVERYONE because it brings ALL over humanity down to the level of slaves.

This is like forcing elephants to do tricks for food. That's not legal anymore either. This is why circuses all closed down. It is unethical. And it is about time that this is reflected for humans too.",2023-01-15 10:07:58,2023,1,15,10,7,58

10c3prd,12,405freeway,7,homeless,I Live on the Balcony - Part 1,"I grew up here. But I left, and came back. I wasn’t even gone that long but things are different. It took five days to get from Tampa to Los Angeles. 

I had already removed the back seats in my truck and built a platform to sleep on, with storage underneath, and a yoga mat, pillow, and blanket laid out on top. Space was limited, so I couldn’t bring much with me. Everything else was left behind with with my parents.

The first night I slept in my truck at a rest stop just west of Memphis. I wasn’t ready for the change in weather, going from muggy Florida heat to the bitter Arkansas cold. My blanket wasn’t thick enough and I started to get sick.

The next day I met an internet friend just north of Dallas. We had played Among Us throughout the pandemic but never seen each other IRL. When I got there we had a bonfire at the lakefront behind his house, drinking whiskey and beer, and eating Nepali barbecue. It was some of the best tasting food I’ve ever had. I was so exhausted from the drive that I passed out on the ground and got bug bites all over my forearms. Thankfully the rest of the night was spent in a real bed.

The third day was the longest- exactly one thousand miles to a rest stop south of Sedona. I hit a major rainstorm in Flagstaff and stopped at a Target for some generic-brand Nyquil and a 4-pack of local IPAs. There were college kids everywhere inside. The drive down to the rest stop through the Coconino forest was pitch black and the roads were slick. I was happy to be done for the night and downed half the bottle of medicine.

When I woke up, the sunrise was barely illuminating the mountains and I remembered why I wanted to stop here: Northern Arizona is one of the most beautiful places on the planet. I took a scenic route through Cottonwood back into Sedona for food at the Coffee Pot Restaurant. It was exactly how I remembered it from when I first visited 15 years ago. After a breakfast of biscuits and gravy I took the road back to Cottonwood and made my way up to Jerome, a small historic boomtown on the side of many cliffs. I pulled over to walk around and admire the dilapidated buildings, still standing despite the overwhelming feeling of ruin and abandonment throughout the streets. Other tourists did the same, dipping into cafes and gift shops. I continued driving on to Whiskey Row in Prescott to have a quick beer at the Palace Saloon, then headed south toward Phoenix. I had more friends in Tempe hosting me that night, and they treated me to beer and arcade games at BRI Taproom followed by dinner and drinks at Lom Wong.

I stayed one more day in Tempe, suffering through my sickness. It was a work day, so my friends were gone, and I didn’t do much of anything besides rest. In the evening they treated me once again, this time to burgers and beer at the Chuckbox. I liked that place.

I felt much better and left early the next morning before my friends did. I wanted to beat as much traffic as possible. I gassed up before leaving the state (it was much cheaper due to lower Arizona taxes) and continued over the horizon into California. As I started the downhill descent towards Indio I could see the Salton Sea, an environmental disaster that was dressed up as a paradise for decades before becoming a saline wasteland of toxic dust, but I still want to visit someday. In Thousand Palms I stopped at In-N-Out for my first meal back as a Californian. It was perfect. Then, finally, I reached Los Angeles.",2023-01-14 16:12:59,2023,1,14,16,12,59

10bvi0i,22,Mikhael_G,33,homeless,Do people often think...,"That homeless people are unaware that they smell? I mean come on. How stupid can people be? To tell someone that they stink but offer no solutions or any kind of help to get their personal hygiene in tact is just God awful. 

I'm pretty sure any competent, functional person would know that they smell if they haven't taken a shower or do laundry in awhile. And then there's those who can't take care of themselves or have severe mental illness.

It's really insulting. It's like kicking someone while they're already down. Not to mention, it is isolating. You become more self conscious, so, you tend to move away from people in order to avoid harsh judgments. 

I'm not being dismissive of the fact that people's odors can be ""offensive"" but if the person is obviously homeless, why even bother to say that they smell if you know damn well you're not gonna help?

Everything is sticky. Floors, tables. I wish I could go grab a mop and spend an hour mopping the whole floor. When I wasn't homeless, I would often bring paper towels and cleaner to work and wipe up the grime and piss and shit out of the bathroom and take out the trash. It's not just annoying that I have to deal with other people's grime, it's that in many situations it would be impossible impractical or expensive to be able to clean it myself.

Was made homeless after I left my ex partner after I got to sick to work and she was effectively destroyed my mental health.
First month I spent sofa surfing while trying to get help from my local council which thay put me in a b&b which was where I ended up having my first mental breakdown where I was dropped from Thayer duty (6 month)so I went back to sofa surfing for anouther year but came with issues due to medical needs. So I went to council where my son is under so I could be closer so I could see him where thay moved me to a bigger city while thay helped me at the time I was just a shell of what I was. Spent a year with the council to get myself on the social property register which I will say left me emotionally dead inside. While I was with the council care I was put up in anouther b&b which wasn't the nicest place and was just full of drugs and prostitute's which is no help to someone who's on resitected medication ( was removed off the medication while I was there ) but I had the ball rolling as I was able to bid and receive property offers which when your in a dark place mentally is nice light in that dark tunnel. Finally at the end of last year I moved into a property I can call home where now I'm back on the correct medication for my illness and hopefully will be able to the correct mental health assistance which is needed (bpd and PTSD ) . Out of everything I went through and learnt in the time I was homeless is there are people who will help you but more people who will just try and take advantage of you. Just keep your head up high and don't be scared of asking your council or community for help as there are opportunities for everyone from all walks of life.",2023-01-13 21:55:15,2023,1,13,21,55,15
10be6ev,8,sugarcookie423,5,homeless,Will likely be homeless by middle of February,"I have never been homeless before. I have lived in recovery houses and have been to rehabs and spent time in the psych unit. I am clean and sober now. I am currently living in low income housing. I was on short term disability from work due to my physical health and then they told me they were transferring me to long term disability (through an insurance company). I did not plan for it to take this long. The process started all the way back in November. I was told 60 days at the most. I got a letter from the insurance company last week saying that they still have not received all of my records in order for them to make a decision to approve me for long term disability. I had to call all of my doctors (which a few of them told me it was bs and they already sent them a few copy’s of my records). So here I am, without pay, not being able to pay rent, and the insurance company is taking their time while not even responding to me. Every time I call I get “sorry, the person you are trying to contact is with another client” and no email back. Even if I call and try to explain what is going on I get “sorry, I have to transfer you to your claim manager”. It’s complete bs.

With my rent I had to complete paper work stating I am no longer receiving pay. Since I got a partial pay back in December they are making me pay rent for December but they are trying to make me pay rent (more than $500) for January when I have absolutely no money coming in. It totals out to be a little more than $1000. They asked me if I can pay the $500 and I said there’s no way. They said “don’t worry about it for the weekend. We’ll let you know next week.” I do plan on getting the money out of my 401k but that is not even $200.

If I get evicted, I honestly would not care to leave the city I am staying in. There has been a ton of trauma that has happened to me here. I want to leave this place behind. I live in Pittsburgh. I would have no problem packing up a book bag, getting on a bus, and going to a different city (as long as I can afford it). I do have state insurance and on life sustaining meds so would need insurance in a different state. I may be better off staying in PA. I have considered moving to Erie.

I often don’t carry cash or things like that, and so when I see people on the street asking for things or with signs I am unable to give them things. Once when I was in San Diego I bought water bottles for the trip and came upon some people and gave them some because I had them, and today on my way to get fast food I saw a man with a sign so when I was out I got him some food. I’ve thought before about having bags with things in them that I can give. Like toothbrush(es), deodorant, fast food gift cards, water bottles, tampons/pads, chip bags and the like. 
So my question is, if someone were to give you something like that, what would you want to see in it and what wouldn’t you?
I also make blankets from fleece, would those be good? I would probably make it so that it could be folded up and put on as a backpack or something. And I would most likely give those ‘bags’ in reusable grocery bags or ones with zippers or something. Any suggestions or comments help. Thank you!",2023-01-13 13:08:32,2023,1,13,13,8,32

I'm thinking about someone with Alzheimers suddenly being forced out of thier home and landing on the streets. Maybe someone in a wheelchair or someone who just had surgery and has limited mobility. Maybe someone with chronic health issues. Maybe just someone in thier 70's or 80's. Yeah, that sort of thing.

It happened again tonight and my dad refused to side with me. I was having a mental breakdown begging my dad to do something and he said there's nothing he can do.

My dad says we're adults and should work it out amongst ourselves, but I raised my voice telling my brother to stop and my dad said I'm partially in the wrong for yelling at and interrupting my brother.

My dad said he'll never kick my brother out because he's an autistic amputee (missing his right leg from below the knee down), but that shouldn't make it okay for my brother to treat me like trash. 

So, I'm gone.

I can't live with my boyfriend because his parents are extremely conservative and don't believe in living together before marriage, but he said he'd let me in when they're not home to let me shower and wash my clothes and stuff. I'm extremely blessed that's an option for me.

Does anyone have any beginner tips? I'm packing right now and don't have time to browse this sub for advice. Any advice is appreciated.",2023-01-10 12:00:55,2023,1,10,12,0,55

108a0o4,134,clad_in_wools,46,homeless,How I got out of being homeless after 5 years on the street. I am now a homeowner.,"Greetings to all of you and I hope you're staying warm. It occurred to me this morning, as I held the keys to my new house in my hand, how lucky I am to now be permanently removed from the situation I was previously in. To this day, I am still paranoid, guarded as I sleep, my back hurts -- I bear all the scars of life on the street. But healing now feels possible for me, and I want to share it. Not everything I suggest is possible for everyone who might be reading, but on the odd chance that even one of you here reading this could stand to benefit, I'm happy to write it.

I was homeless for 5 years. Now I am a homeowner. Here are my tips. Please don't take them as some kind of judging statement against folks who for whatever reason couldn't do what I have done. I am sharing mostly to say: if you're sick of where you're at in life, here's at least one proven formula that can work so long as you are capable of working a minimum wage job, using Google, improving your credit, and are 100% flexible with where you wind up so long as you manage to buy a house.



My trick to survival was moving around constantly. I never stayed anywhere for more than a few days. I was always walking, bicycling, hitchhiking, or riding freight trains, figuring that being new in town (and soon to leave) would remove me from the daily dramas of those who are indefinitely on the street in one town. This worked, but it tired me out. I retreated to the forest and built an illegal cabin in a remote area, where I stayed for a winter. This was hard for me, and by spring, I knew I had to do something. I joined the US Coast Guard. I did this because I didn't want to kill anyone, but knew that a stint in the Armed Forces can give someone a big boost. It has worked for me, and if you are under the age of 42, in decent physical shape, with no seriously disqualifying medical history, a minimal criminal record, and no crazy debts or tattoos, you could do this too (we are desperate for new recruits). 

But I am not making a recruiting ad. What I did to secure a house for myself could be done by most people, I would guess -- it just requires a level of flexibility not everyone has. Here are the steps and some considerations:

1. In six states, the minimum wage is over $13/hr. Washington, Oregon, California, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut all pay this fairly substantial sum. No one *wants* to work for minimum, but that wage is just what it says -- the lowest you can go. If the bottom is significantly higher, you can gain. Obviously, you can go to other states, but always do the math of figuring what your mortgage will be and making sure it'll be the same as whatever a week's local minimum wage work will get you, to be safe.

2. The trick is to find the cheapest livable house you can in one of these states -- easier said than done. But not impossible. I was shocked at the sort of house a bank will give a mortgage for! My house needs a new roof, needs new siding, and has a wrecked barn that needs to be torn down. The bank didn't care, and I was able to secure home insurance on it (this was the hardest part) by doing a very extensive search. 

3. But before you can buy a house, you need two things: credit and a down payment. I was always under the impression that these things were out of reach. They aren't. 

4. My advice to anyone who wants out of their tough situation: Take one year and buckle down. Search the whole country for jobs that pay reasonably well. It's winter -- ski country in the intermountain west and Vermont can yield good jobs, often with guaranteed housing. Bus tickets are cheap and in a few days, you can beg enough for one on the street. Get yourself from where you currently are to having *any* job.

5. Get EBT *before* you get a job if you can, to buy yourself 6 months of basic help with food. Usually harder to get once you're working legitimately in my experience.

6. Save every single dollar you get. The goal is to get ~$7k - $8k. 

7. Apply for small credit of any kind. Play the game. Search all over the internet on how to play this game to win as soon as humanly possible. Run all essential purchases through your credit card and pay it religiously *no matter what*. Within 12 - 24 months, you can improve your credit enough to get a tiny mortgage. Keyword: tiny. Very small mortgages are, according to everyone in that industry I spoke with while shopping for loans, way way way easier to qualify for that gigantic $300k mortgages most people seem to get.

8. Search Zillow in high minimum wage states until you find ANY house that appears livable and is under $60k asking price. Be meticulous. Check EVERYWHERE. The longer it's been sitting on the market, the lower your offer can be. The lower your offer is, the lower the down payment and the monthly payment. Contrary to a lot of the complaints about the price of housing, there are many places in the US, even in the high minimum wage states, where livable homes can be purchased for $40k or less. Do keep in mind: it'd be tough to get a mortgage below $30k. The very best you could do is about $35k -- the smallest list price for which you can get a mortgage. 

9. Once your credit is decent and you've got about $8k, call banks. If you've got a target region that has a decent supply of affordable homes, go there and visit credit unions in person if you can. Read the culture of the area: if you're in a rural area or a small town (which you likely will be as most 'cheap' homes in cities are in horrible neighborhoods and come with thousands of dollars in tax penalties etc) don't show up with blue hair and an unkempt beard or in a skimpy dress. Get your clothes from Tractor Supply or Wal-Mart. Speak plainly. Say ""yes sir"" and ""no ma'am"" and ""God bless"". Talk about your ambitions to be hardworking and have a family and go to Church, and be prepared to participate in the community you move to. Even if you don't like this, I promise it's not as bad as it's made out to be -- and owning a house anywhere is better than being homeless. 

10. You will get approved if you can get a 650 credit score, which is not particularly hard to do in my experience if you have a job and exceptionally responsible use of credit for a couple years. I went from a 430 to a 690 in about that time. Once approved, it's time to do two things: get yourself to the target area and find a job. This next chapter is the toughest part, particularly if in a small town. You need to keep a *very* low profile, quietly working and living outdoors. Get a bicycle and a tent that camouflages into the land. Stay well out of town in an unpopulated area. Keep working and paying your credit card. 

11. Look at houses. Google helps; research what to look for. Stick a pocket knife in the floor joists in the basement to see if they're solid. Look for newer hot water heaters and furnaces. Small houses are the best as they're the cheapest to improve. My house is ~700 sq ft; I pieced together a roof for about $1k and do it myself (YouTube is your friend). Yes, even with inflation you can do it. 

12. Once approved, make an offer. Google everything (that's what I did). It's a slog to get through the paperwork, but the lenders are highly motivated lately. I was given a $40 mortgage without any home inspection requirement, no appraisal, and the whole process took about 60 days, including making an offer. In small towns, there's less bullshit to deal with - small-town realtors seem to be driven to get it done quick, especially if it's a small sale like mine was.   

13. Hot tip: If you can double your efforts with a friend, do that. Hell, do it with three of you. All of your names can be on the house title, it's not hard to do. Take the one of you with the best credit and put it in his or her's name. Pool your cash and keep track of who spends what. Then, with a sub-$60k house, you'll be *splitting* a mortgage that is less than $500/mo two or three ways...

At day's end, my mortgage is $400/mo with all the taxes and insurance in escrow (meaning included in the monthly payment). My electric bill is, if I am smart, $20/mo. I use a flip phone I got on eBay for $20 and my monthly bill for it is $15. I use the library for internet and download music and movies to use at home. I installed a wood stove from Craigslist ($120) and heat my house with wood -- which I usually can find for free. I bought a $3000 beater pickup truck I can fix myself (with YouTube's help) and use it to get firewood. I go to Church to network with folks who offer me wood in exchange for picking up their yard or shoveling them out. (Even if you don't agree with going to Church, if you live in a rural area, I'm telling you, go anyway. Services are harmless and you WILL get access to all kinds of opportunities you wouldn't get sitting at home on a Sunday). I wash my laundry by hand right now but am working on building a bicycle-powered washer. I dry it on the line, which oddly enough works well even in winter. I grew 600 pounds of cabbage last year and turned it into sauerkraut. Grew 200 pounds of potatoes. I borrowed a 30-30 from a guy at Church and shot a deer that yielded me 150 pounds of meat. Also shot two turkeys and five rabbits. Now working on chickens for eggs and meat. Minimum wage take-home weekly pay in my state at 40 hours of work per week is about $400, which would leave you with another $1200 to pay for electric ($20), auto insurance ($80 here), food you can't grow or kill, and savings. I'm making more than this, and odds are decent you could get there too. 

I have helped two people IRL do exactly this. When I say it's doable, I'm not lying. Maybe you don't want to live in a small rural town, but I'm telling you, once you get into your own house and lock the door, you won't care where you are so long as you've got a yard to garden and there aren't bullets flying around your neighborhood. Maybe you don't like conservative backwoods folks but they WILL help you if you play the game they're playing even a tiny bit. My ""racist deplorable Trumper"" neighbors have helped me more than any agency in any city ever did. City poverty is a TRAP! Get away!

Also, do NOT be afraid of winter!!! A house in a freezing cold region with long dark cloudy winters and ten feet of snow is better than being homeless in Florida! Really! Do not let climate impact where you look at all. 

A variation on this can also be done with land if you're *really* resilient, and it takes a lot less to start it up. Find a town with no building codes and cheap land (try WV). You can usually get land loans on small parcels for 40% down. Say, a $10k 3-acre parcel, totally unimproved, can be bought for $4k down and 24 months of $274 payments at 9% interest (rates are way higher for land loans). As long as you have a truck and a minimum wage job, even with lower minimum wages, you can live. Sometimes, there are parcels for sale for less than $6k outright - look in forested regions with plenty of rainfall. You don't need more than an acre but it's good to have it if you can. Avoid the desert! Tons of cheap ways to build a livable cabin. Again, YouTube can teach you all sorts of things. I never had anyone teach me how to do the things I do, I just Googled it. Sink some concrete sleeves into 6' deep post holes and put 6"" diameter young, straight tree logs into them (preferably hardwood) and build a cabin frame onto those. Tarpaper is cheap and for a small place, so is tin. Insulate with wool moving blankets from Alibaba. Or search up straw bale construction. Get a big garden. Kill squirrels and rabbits and learn to skin and eat them. I'm dead serious I know guys who did it, went straight from sleeping under the West Side Highway in Manhattan to living like this in Kentucky. He sends me typewritten letters and says he works 20hrs a week at a truck stop and spends the rest of his time with his chickens writing poems and fixing his old F-150.

For me, the house worked. The military helped, but I now realize I could've done this even without the military. Saving $8k in a year isn't that hard if you don't pay rent, just work full time and preferably try to get to a state that pays a decent minimum wage (or work under the table somewhere). 

Anyway, hope I didn't piss anyone off with this post. If it's not for you that's ok, but again, if even ONE person reads this and comes to believe they can get there and goes and does it, it was worth it to share. God bless all of you.

We frequently have people that sit on our back step to chill, eat, smoke, do whatever they need to do and that has never bothered us. They usually just pass through and we don’t typically see the same people a lot. 

There was a large snowstorm that passed through our city and there has been a man sleeping by our back step since the storm. We are not used to people staying more than a couple nights, as I said they typically just pass through no problem. We’ve been cutting this guy some slack on his stay because it’s been freezing outside and it would be cruel to make him move when he’s found a comfortable and decently warm spot. 

When he first started sleeping here he would give a quick remark as we walked inside: “Happy New Year”, “Have a great day”, etc. As the days have progressed so have his remarks and today he asked if we had any dogs in the house (we don’t) and he said “What, no guardians?”. This is the first we’ve ever experienced this, people ask us for money and food and we give what we can but we’re also struggling in our 20s so there’s only so much we can help. 

We don’t want to call the cops on him and get him in trouble but his remarks are just starting to scare us a little. The snow is melting, would it be rude to ask him to find a different spot? What is the best way to go about doing that?",2023-01-09 15:28:23,2023,1,9,15,28,23

I've given food in the past. I don't know whether they're truly homeless or just struggling - not that it makes a difference - I see giving as an opportunity to humanize and love someone who needs it, but idk if I'm doing enough so is it enough to give food or what can I do to help more? I hate to sound judgemental, I know that drugs can be part of the problem with homelessness, so I generally avoid giving money for this reason, but at the same time I feel guilty for having that mindset, idk. I want to help more than just giving a meal. Tents? Hand warmers? A burner for heat? I've seen some home made heaters for these situations but I don't have any links so if anyone knows of anything.

106cagz,55,RabidusRex,36,homeless,Homelessness is an obvious result of the systematic breakdown of the family unit.,"Cultures with strong family and community structures don't experience rampant homelessness issues.  Countries like America have cultural systems in place that encourage people to abandon their young children and elderly parents to the mercy of a cruel and cold capitalistic dystopian hellscape.

Most of the other gypsies and vagabonds I have met on the road (who have shared their tale) either escaped their family home because of violence or sexual abuse... or their family kicked them out of the house once they came of age.

Which seems to be a ""thing"" in America in particular.  Like, oh, your kid just finished high school, has no job or life experience, let's FORCE THEM TO LIVE ON THE STREET.  People hate raising their own children so much that they force them into destitution as soon as it's legally possible to do so.  It sucks.  I just see these situations so often here, I find it disheartening that folks feel ok about abandoning their own kids.  

Anyway, I'm an older dude, I have a kid in their 20's.  I make sure that she knows that as long as I have a house, SHE ALWAYS HAS A PLACE TO STAY.  Parents, stop kicking your kids out of the house when they come of age.  It's not helpful.  It just cripples your child's chance of having a successful future.",2023-01-07 23:44:07,2023,1,7,23,44,7

105gq6h,15,veryberryblue,15,homeless,What was it like when you first found yourself homeless?,"What was it like (and what did you do) when you first found yourself homeless?.

I can imagine that some of it would have to do with the time of day but other than that, you may have been terrified and had no idea what to do, where to go or who to reach out to for help. Especially if it was your first time.

I was homeless and also a vagabond for quite a few years and I'm still kind of living on the edge now but I always kept a ""just in case"" bookbag/backpack handy with things I might need in such a situation.

Depending on the time of day I found myself homeless, I might find a place to grab a coffee, look over a map and try to figure out where I wanted to go and what I hoped to do when I got there. Then, I'd hitch-hike, train-hop or whatever until I got where I wanted to be. If it was late at night, my first priority would be to find a safe place to sleep until the next day. If my clothes were raggedy and I needed a shower, I'd try to find a clothing pantry and a shelter where I could get a quick shower and a change of clothes and good walking shoes/boots. If it was freezing outside, I'd layer my clothes and do the ""turtle"" thing when sleeping. If I was really hungry, my first priority might be to hit up a restaurant, dumpster-dive or panhandle. So, it would all depend on the time of day and needs I had when I found myself homeless.

So, what were some of the first things you did when you found yourself homeless?. Try to find something to eat?. Hitch a ride, study a map (or GPS)?. Look for a place to sleep?. Call friends/family?. Head to a Church or shelter?. What was your game-plan and what things did you do right after becoming homeless?.",2023-01-06 22:20:15,2023,1,6,22,20,15

I have my dorm address listed as my permanent address. My parents agreed to pay for the first year of college but I am cut off after that. I do not stay with my parents during breaks because A) I have never lived where they went in my life and I'd feel very out of place and B) they are very abusive, toxic people. I would take my sister's cramped apartment any day over being prosecuted just because I'm queer. With all that being said, am I legally considered homeless?

I was in the house I grew up in for a few years after both my parents had passed and I couldn't keep it, nor was I ok after they passed. The depression came in waves of strength but it never went away. I kept my job the entire time and still have it. Hell I even had just got a promotion a few months back but I had to give that up under the pretense I was gonna get a transfer to a different city. I'm in Daytona Beach, and I was supposed to go to Orlando to be by family but all the variables stacked onto another left me with no money to save. Nor do they actually have any room for me as I was supposed to use the cash to find a room and now that's invalid

I have 5 days staying at a friend's house RN but I know I have to leave soon and after that I have no place to go. I'm still getting hours at work for the time being so when I do end up nowhere I can at least cover my storage for another month or two, but my question is this. I have some friends in Vegas who informed me if I can get a way there, they would have a couch for me. Everyone I've talked to says Florida is atrocious for homeless, and I see it here as well between the junkies and such. I don't do hard drugs nor do I drink, in fact I recently stopped smoking pot entirely to be alert and pass whatever drug test for shelters and such so I'm sober entirely RN. But I'm still worried that being in Florida in general is gonna decrease my chances to try to get back on my feet drastically. 

Would I have a better chance in Vegas? I know I have a couch for a few weeks max as I wouldn't want to be a bother to them that long at all, I would just want to find work there or maybe even try to get a transfer of my current job so I can try to save up some money there, throw them some money for their kindness until I can get into like a transitional housing situation or something. I'm not sure what my options are and even though the desire to throw myself under a train isn't there anymore (took me years after mom and pops passed to not wanna die and join them and I'm still not ok entirely) I don't wanna just give up and fade away. I'm just scared, confused, and trying to be awake after wanting to be asleep for 3½ years. 

I know it would take an egregious amount to save up a way to get there though and I intend to try to work still, just have to cut back hours I think as a bed and showers are gonna start to become luxury items as such",2023-01-03 03:26:22,2023,1,3,3,26,22

I get incredibly sad and jealous at the same time when I see close friends, couples or families hanging out together and having a great time. If I walk into a biz and some random stranger smiles at me or simply says ""hi"", I get a huge ""high"" off of it. I feel like a shelter dog thats been in a cage for a long time and nobody will adopt them.

It's tough as nails to make friends these days or get into a good relationship and even tougher to maintain that friendship/relationship. I mean, you have to just bump into someone first and maybe get a convo going. If it goes well, you next have to have shared interests or things in common. You have to establish trust...a bond...spend days, weeks, years hanging out together and socializing and even then, there is no guarantee that a friendship/bond will form.

At some point, you find out that your new friend has a dark past, maybe violent tendancies or has an addiction problem. Maybe your new girlfriend/boyfriend gives you an STD and isn't honest about it up-front. Maybe the new person in your life has a family that hates your guts or the person just turns out to be really wierd or have some creepy fetish or whatever and you don't find out until you have already wasted a whole year just getting to know them.

Out on the streets it's even more difficult because a lot of folks are on high-alert for danger, in survival-mode and distrustful of others because thier safety and even lives can depend on it. Other people could care less about being your friend and just can't be bothered.

I know the following is true- that my past has a huge impact on the issues I face as an adult. That it can only be sorted out by a professional. But I can't see myself going to *anyone* and just telling my life story because it's so cringe to me. Yet other people dump this stuff on random people even all the time. 

Do people actually empathize when people start a convo or post with listing all the reasons they are especially disadvantaged? Because it makes me want to hurl and I also think they have a developmental delay or personality disorder. That's not what everyone really thinks tho? Because maybe it's because I have an extreme amount of shame for things like that and I'm projecting that towards these other people who express themselves this way. That is highly likely, BUT..

 I also know enough to know that in general people really don't give a fuck about other people if they're not somehow invested already. Like when someone lists off their problems instead of just addressing the main point I get kind of offended like it's awfully audacious of them to help themselves to my time or the assumption that I would automatically give a flying fuck.

Recently we had an extreme cold snap (usually it does not get very cold in winter where we live). There is a homeless man who we often see sleeping rough in our neighborhood and we were worried about whether he would survive the coming weather so we offered him to come inside for a few days. Now it has been two weeks and it is back in the 60s, but he is refusing to leave, even though he agreed from the beginning that this would just be a temporary arrangement for the duration of the cold spell.

We have reached out to help him connect with a social worker and resources for getting shelter and a job long-term, but it seems like wait times for these programs are typically months if not years. We have offered to give him some money if he will leave that he can use towards a deposit for an apartment or for a motel. We have even threatened to call the police if he does not leave of his own accord, though I hesitate to actually act on this given horror stories about law enforcement interactions with homeless people, as well as what an arrest would mean for his prospects of being able to take advantage of any of those programs.

He has made no movements towards leaving and just keeps repeating when we bring it up that he has nowhere else to go. So far he has been polite and mostly keeping to himself, and we have avoided precipitating a confrontation because we do not know what he might do if he gets angry. However, my husband and I will have to go back to work this week and I don't want to be alone with him while my husband is not here, and I certainly don't trust him to be alone with our kids. It is time for him to go--does anyone have any advice on what I should do to remove him in a way that is compassionate?

I was married with two kids in 2015. I had a stable job and I was working through a rough marriage. I knew my spouse had some manic depression/bipolar and I stood by him through the hardest times. We separated for a time, due to his drug and alcohol use and I went live with a family member for several months while we tried to work out our issues. He got a better job and sobered up a bit. I went back and we were pregnant with our third kid. The first week I found out I was pregnant, I lost my job. I found another job but it was so rough with two kids and being pregnant, I had to leave. My husband was living in a different state for a job and sending what money he could. Eventually he came back and we sofa hopped for a bit and I asked if we could try the local shelters. We went through the application process and we were accepted. We lived in a shelter for two months with two kids under age of five. 

We still had a vehicle, but payments were getting behind. My husband worked, as it was part of the shelter program we were in, and we eventually went to a transitional housing in 2015. Our son was born two months later and I took a small job while going back to school. We were doing well for awhile until my husband started using again in 2017. I wanted to leave the transition house and he became complacent. I eventually left and took three kids with me on my own.

It’s been a wild life. My oldest will be thirteen soon and she is the only one that remembers living in a homeless shelter. She will bring up memories here and there. She recently asked if she could work towards getting into an Ivy League College one day. I didn’t know what that was at her age. So, I sit back and humble myself a bit just thinking about where we have been in life. I’m grateful for the people that made my family a meal during those times and that we had a place to rest our heads at night.

i have a part time job and i make $1600/month. i will also be attending community college now to complete a CS degree (should be done in a year or so), so working more right now is impossible due to my mental and physical issues. i have ended up in the hospital attempting to do two full time jobs. i cannot get private loans because i don’t have a co-signer, so i can expect to get a grand or two each semester from fafsa. i can also get a bus pass through my school and access to a gym. i’m trying to sign up for food stamps but the process is difficult. i might be able to stay with a friend for a few nights but not long term, and i have no other financial supports.

I pay a minimum of $600 in credit card bills and therapy/medical bills (no longer spending credit ofc, i set up a payment plan with lower interest through some program. i will call and see if they can lower my monthly dues due to my situation). after that i’m left with $1100. so already i think i’m starting with a lot of options compared to some, but the issue lies in the cost of living here. rent is insane. even with roommates i’d be lucky to find something under what i have left, and then i would have zero dollars for emergency expenses, or utilities or anything. it doesn’t help that i don’t know how to network and find roommates or living situations. i’ve looked on craigslist and everything seems dangerous for a woman, and everything on facebook is seeking more middle class rents that i can’t afford. seems most opportunities are found by knowing people, which i do not. i also have a general fear of people and have difficulties making friends. 

it’s my weak understanding that transitional housing  can offer semi long term opportunities for some people and section 8 vouchers and stuff (which from my understanding can take years anyway). let’s say i was somehow eligible for this. do i live alone? with others? is it safe? how much will i pay? because until i graduate there’s no chance of making more money than i already am, and if i can graduate i can potentially make a living wage and help my family members escape too. so how can you transition from this housing to “normal” housing if you cannot afford it? and if i were to attempt to do this with family (two disabled adults) will that change things?

I’ll have about 1500 saved up. I have $600 now. I plan to stay in a hotel. If I had a car or could drive, i’d live in my car. 

I’m a CNA and I get paid really well but the problem is the hotels are extremely far from my job. Ubers would be about $14-$24 everyday. On top of that, I’d have to pay for the room every night which would probably total up to $300 by the end of the week. 

But I found an apartment, the rent is $560 a month which is so affordable but It’s in a sketchy neighborhood. Ubers there everyday is $14 which is cheaper. Which option is better for me? 

I get paid biweekly, about $1100-1200
Looking for another job closer isn’t an option as this the best paying CNA job in my area.",2022-12-30 06:13:20,2022,12,30,6,13,20

zyuc19,8,ArtLadyCat,14,homeless,Need advice,"So, for history we got evicted back in our old state and have been in our current one long enough to be residents. 

We took some bad advice to ‘wait for court to leave so he can’t claim you owe even more’ as the landlord we had at the time had tried many shady things already(even lied in court!) and now we are stuck with this on our record. 

Because of this, on top of being low income already, we are in a bind sleeping in a friends basement and paying them rent. 

We have no vehicle. Currently in the process of getting my license(old state wasn’t a great place to get it after the people who had custody of me as a child refused to let me get it while in hs). Kinda makes it harder since there isn’t a rule you can’t there but also you technically have to lie to do so because the paperwork is made for teenagers and teenagers only. Anyway here it isn’t and I can exist and get it, however friends hubby decided ‘until you find a place’ and doing a short term agreement to revisit later is now ‘be out by February’. 

We cannot find a rental. We’ve spent months applying. In the aftermath of what happened it turns out better halves credit dropped off from 688 to ‘no credit’ so apparently that also dings us too. Obviously we are on that but I cannot do much about it before time. It dropped off without warning while we’ve been dealing with this situation. 

I’m disabled, on a walker, keep getting denied for assistance so got someone who does that for a living to help from over by the homeless shelter. Kiddo is on the spectrum. We aren’t on disability, either one of us. We only managed to get kiddo seen after we moved so the diagnosis is recent for kiddo but for me I was told they’d owe me too much back pay so wouldn’t do so. I try to find jobs anyway but so far they see physical and realize I’ve a ptsd on top of that and naada. That’s if the walker alone don’t scare them off. I’ll be the only one able to drive when I get my license due to better half having his own medical issues.

We aren’t legally married but we’ve been together a long time. 

I’m doing my best to plan but we cannot even qualify for a small loan to help get a vehicle sooner rather than later and even then we’ll probably be camping and sleeping in Walmart parking lots a lot. What we managed to bring with us? We’re losing even more and we lost nearly everything in the first place.

Have applied for lists and had eyes on housing assist lists but we keep running into lists being closed or only for people who are chronically homeless, and since we’ve been doing our best not to be homeless all along we’ve managed to avoid it until recently.

I don’t know what to do or where to turn. Every door is closed and every window empty. No matter what I do out ends up feeling so stupidly hopeless. Like all we did was delay it. 

I need to know somewhere concrete to turn or something we can do. Anything. At current time all I can think of is that we’ll be sleeping in a Walmart parking lot even if we can get a car. I’ve marked items to help shower and have a means to cook food etc, but I’ve not been camping since I was seven or eight years old and I refuse to have my family in the situation I was when homeless at barely legal age.

I need solutions, things to do, places to turn that won’t turn us away. 

I’ve called 211, gone through various housing searches and even obscure ones you really only hear about through them or some sort of service that deals with them otherwise. I’ve searched hud and I’ve endured near countless disappointment for months while doing searching. (Section 8 is closed but the lists are still viable so used the housing list and checked lists). 

I have been endured all manner of attitude so my family doesn’t have to. Some people ate compassionate. Some of them will insist there is some service you’ve yet found or simply not bothered with. They can’t tell you what that is but they are convinced it must exist. Some have told me people needing help are simply lazy or that it is our fault bc better halves job doesn’t pay more so we can just buy a house.

I need methods. I need ideas. Just someone please tell me there is something I’ve not tried yet. Something. And if not some method my family survives this together somehow with needs met even if only just until we can figure something out. 

If there is something I’ve missed someone please direct me to it.

zxvdan,34,snapwired,56,homeless,Beaten for stealing a sleeping bag on a cold night,"I was freezing my ass off and had not slept a minute in 3 or 4 nights because it was so painfully cold. I had very little money so I went to Walmart, picked out some meager food items to eat and yes, made the decision to put a $28 sleeping bag in my cart I couldn't afford to pay for. I didn't choose the most expensive one by any means, just the minimum I thought it would take to keep warm. 

I went through self checkout scanning everything but the sleeping bag, calmly put the food and the bag into my cart and was waived right past the greeter, receipt in hand. About 5 seconds later, I hear the greeter from about 20 ft. behind me start saying ""Sir! SIR!"". I kept walking not even pausing to look, after all, I was waived through and was now out of the store. I then abruptly heard a male voice yelling "" Hey! YOU!"" Still I kept calmly walking pushing my cart down an aisle of parked vehicles. I was praying that was it and as I parked the cart at the curb and began to take out the items to start walking off property,  I hear again from much closer, a bunch of heavy footsteps, and see 4 large males surrounding me. I began to walk with my items away from then but then before I knew it one of em shouted ""Fuck him up!"". One got me in a police style chokehold from behind cutting off my windpipe and the others took shots at my face before I hit the ground, with the chokehold still applied to my neck. I was about to lose consciousness when the guy finally let go. They took the sleeping bag back inside, left my food and told me to never come back. 

I picked up my food and walked back to where I knew people and everyone was shocked. My face was bloody and swollen and it was apparent I was on the business end of a gang style beat down. I called the police to make a report, the cops came, one of them drove over to Walmart to "" investigate "" and came back with the story it was just 4 random guys that did this and NOT Walmart security. There was never a follow up with me by the police and I don't think it was ever investigated.

Everyone i know says I have an airtight lawsuit against Walmart, but I'm not the lawsuit type of person. What do you guys think about this? I still get pain in my eye socket where I think the skull was fractured. It's been 6 months.",2022-12-28 21:14:52,2022,12,28,21,14,52

zwx6hm,5,Sickologyy,17,homeless,"Anyone familiar with RV's? Questions for Mechanics, Plumbers, RV specialists, and even electronics.","Just not sure where to start, my RV is so old I can't really find matching advice/documentation on how to deal with it, some of my questions are basic, some are more technical.  I just don't learn well reading alone, I have to at bare minimum ask questions.  I hope someone here can chime in some advice.

1. RV toilets, people have explained how they work in basic sense, but not enough to tell me how to use it and test if it's working.  Things like, how do I put water into it?  Do I have to use the water tank, or can I manually fill it for only emergencies?  Where's the water tank normally at?  How do I test the lines?  How do I make sure it ""Works"" before ""Soiling"" it?  I at least know where the blackwater drain is, and have a rough idea of the water tanks, but I really don't want to use them.  My goal is to only use in emergencies (Mornings for me, and if I can't get to a regular bathroom) and thus fill it on an as needed basis, then clean on every use to ensure it's clean to my standards.
2. Electrical, this is an older truck outfitted with a single solar panel, all wiring is gone, except the panel to the deep cycle RV battery.  I'm familiar enough with how to use it, using an inverter, however is there a way to calculate the usage, or how long that battery should last on it's own, no incoming power?  I'll be using the solar, but it's old enough it won't be efficient.
3. I'd also like to conserve electricity, so secondary question on electrical, more about saving.  Any advice on jimmy rig but safe fires, cheap/diy candles and heaters with fire are greatly appreciated, It's tiny, so definitely no fireplace.  I'll get candles if I can, but otherwise I'm completely out of money ensuring it works properly and drives.  Should be plenty of ventilation, but I would like to avoid smoky wood fires however I'll take any advice, it's cold out there.
4. I know my way around electronics, but I don't know every single piece, I've only mainly dealt with networking and small electronics repair.  Is there an easy, but safe way, to wire up the main battery and alternator to the deep cycle, and allow it to also charge off the alternator when running?  This would allow me to use the heat from the engine, and keep the battery charged.  Only problem is funds, I have old stereo wiring perfect for this higher voltage (2ga and 0ga) I can strip from my old cars, and eventually will sell one for scrap metal prices.  Any advice here, even cheap equipment to buy over long term is appreciated.

I can't think of anything else for this post, so I leave it here, and do appreciate any additional information or knowledge anyone thinks may be important or useful.

Edit:  To add, I re-watched a few videos about RV basics, but my issue is I need ELI5 there.  They say fill the toilet, where?  How?  Is there a back tank to fill it?  A side tank?  Do I use a pump?  Do I pour water in the back like in a home?  Directly in the bowl?",2022-12-27 19:01:13,2022,12,27,19,1,13

zwqx40,24,CaliCloudburst,10,homeless,People who use the homeless to get social media views,"There's a guy I keep running across on my Facebook page who posts numerous videos of him helping homeless people. He'll walk up to them, ask them what they need, and he'll give it to them, along with some extra money. Of course the homeless person is very grateful (I would be too) and of course hundreds of people post replies about what an awesome guy he is. 
Now please don't get me wrong...I totally believe in helping the homeless whenever you can, but I also just hate the fact that people like this seem to be using the plight of the homeless to garner praise on social media. I don't understand why he can't just do it without filming it and why every good deed has to be put on blast.
Another video I saw the other day really upset me. It was of this guy who had bought a breakfast meal for a homeless gentleman at a Macdonald's, and the staff I guess told him the homeless guy couldn't eat it at the restaurant because there had been complaints of him harassing customers. That happened to me one time...I bought a meal for a homeless woman and the staff told me she wasn't allowed to eat there, so I took the homeless woman to a park and sat and talked with her while she ate. Yet instead of doing that, this kid whips out his phone and proceeds to yell at the staff and law enforcement on video telling them that they are heartless bastards and how dare they not allow him to eat there. It was as if he was trying to be the hero by sticking up for this ""poor homeless man"" and being some sort of justice warrior. It just seemed to me he was using the situation and the homeless man to look like he a hero on social media.
Like I said I totally believe in helping the homeless but there's a way to do it, and I certainly don't think you should be doing it for social media fame. To me that's so wrong and I see it as using the plight of the homeless for your own glory. 
Am I way off kilter here? I also remember one time a homeless guy was kicked out of a restaurant close to me for no obvious reason than he was homeless, but come to find out, he was a predator who had been caught pleasuring himself under the table with kids there.

Because I don't have a room in his home I consider myself and my 2 cats homeless. Due to some bad investments, and trusting my father who ended up lying to me, I lost my home and am now starting over. A huge part of me is very grateful that I at least have a place to sleep and shower, it still gets very cold at night and very discouraging not having a home if my own and it's getting to the point where I feel like I'll never have another home. 

I have a friend who lives a couple hours from me. A few yrs ago she got evicted from her apartment and landed on the streets. I took her into my home and tried to offer her shelter but she was a junkie at the time and I eventually took her to rehab, but she ended up on the streets anyhow. I found a home for her dog and allowed her to store her stuff at my place. 
She pretty much cut herself off and I lost touch with her for several years until a few months ago. It was at this time that I started having problems and through an unfortunate series of events became homeless. I'm trying to work myself out of it but it's hard.
Let me just say she has not been as good a friend and support that I would have hoped. The last time I tried to confide in her about how hopeless I was becoming she basically told me that I needed to quit having a pity party and that God doesn't always want us to be comfortable and how there's something in my life that I'm not fully surrendering to him and that's why I'm in this predicament. She said that she was only telling these things because she ""loves me and is being truthful with me.""
The thing that really bothers me is that when she was down on her luck I did everything I could to help her. I picked her up from the hospital several times because she was going through withdrawals. I even kept her from killing herself when she took a knife and tried to slit her wrists in front of me. I literally held her down until the cops came. I did a lot for her and really tried to help her, and now that she's off the streets and doing well, she's too involved with her fiance and ""ministry"" to help me or even give me any encouragement.
Of all the people who would have some compassion I figured that she would, especially since she used to be in my shoes. But apparently she's too good for that now. I've pretty much given up on even talking to her. I never judged her when she was in my shoes.",2022-12-27 13:32:28,2022,12,27,13,32,28

They don't seem at all suspicious, and what they told me about themself seemed legitimate enough, but I'm going to be living with a complete stranger. And they don't really live in my town, as they're from a small township 45 minutes away from town.
I know it's very common for people to move in with strangers when looking for places with pre established roommates and stuff, but even if i wasn't homeless, doing something like this makes me feel super nervous.
So i guess what I'm asking is, should i take this kind stranger's offer? And if so, what can I do to protect myself for the short time in there?

I never had a good relationship with my mom, and my dad has been out of the picture ever since I was 4. When I was 18 my mom said she didn’t have room for me and I was forced to live with my grandparents. My grandparents didn’t like me and it just made me uncomfortable living there and made me suicidal. I explained to my mom that I was suicidal and I just got the “you’re depressed? I’m depressed. You don’t know what depression is” talk. My mom never cared about my mental health even though I was showing signs of extreme depression at the ripe age of 12. After living with my grandparents for 2 years I met a girl, she was so kind to me, and offered me to live with her. I moved in with her after dating for 2 months because I thought I would be happier with her than with my grandparents, and I was for a little bit. But over time she just became so overwhelming and I didn’t know how to help her. After about 10 months with her I became extremely depressed and tried to kill myself. I was admitted to the mental hospital and they diagnosed me with a personality disorder. I went to visit my mom after I had been released and showed her what I had been diagnosed with and she just brushed it off and told me my disorder was a mindset. I told her about my disorder in hopes that she would try and figure out ways to communicate with me without me feeling like a victim. After a while, I realized that my girlfriend and I were not compatible after a year of being together. I explained to my mom that I wanted to break up with my girlfriend and move in with her again, and she said it was totally fine. I break up with my girlfriend and pack my bags to move in with my mom. After driving 2 hours with everything I own in my car my mom tells me she doesn’t want me around, that I’m crazy, that I would just make Christmas worse. She wants nothing to do with me. She says I just blame her for everything that goes wrong in my life which is not the case at all. But she refuses to try to understand me. She told me I’m not a daughter to her and that she doesn’t want me corrupting my brothers or her “kids” because I’m a bad influence. I’ve been living out of my car ever since and I don’t know what to do.",2022-12-27 00:29:40,2022,12,27,0,29,40

The dog problem is really bad here, and the homeless situation is catching up quick. While I don't personally run any of the rescues, I've had to be extremely creative and network intensely to bring in volunteers to help. I was talking about (honestly as a joke first) starting my own rescue, bringing homeless individuals to take care of the dogs (really not that hard of work) in exchange for some sort of living/Food arrangements on the same land. The rescue world is very expensive, and demands a lot of outside charitable donations, so simply paying them like a normal job wouldn't be very manageable. From some reading around, I've noticed the consensus is that a lot of homeless people are not interested in working, due to many reasons, but I'd imagine SOME would love the opportunity to get into a place with a roof (even if it's just a shed) with some food in exchange for a few hours of work a day.

zuj998,13,wren0in0doubt,22,homeless,At what point does helping become enabling?,"Without going into too much detail, I have a younger brother in another state who is homeless. My mother often asks for money from me to send to him, which I dont mind except for the fact I worry it's doing more harm than good. 
Last time she placed an order at a store near him for him to pick up. When she contacted the store to be sure he picked everything up okay, she was told he's in very rough shape, clearly using heavy drugs, and stole several items from the store after picking up the order. The store manager didnt call police because she felt bad but said she wont allow him back in (understandable). 
This type of situation isnt unusual for him. My mom worries so much about him shoplifting (he's been in jail a few times now) that's she taken to sending him more money more often.
I'm fairly certain that he shop lifts because he uses the money for his drugs, but also understand he's going to use either way. 
With that in mind, is sending the money helping him?? Is it at least allowing him to have the *opportunity* to buy necessities? Beyond that, theres a small chance I'm wrong, and he really does use the money for things he needs (I suppose the argument could also be made that at this point, he probably does need the drugs to survive as well).
I dont know. I'm just very out of my depth here. As I said, I dont mind sending money, but I worry it's doing more harm than good. Any thoughts or insights would be much appreciated

They also say that a homeless person wouldn’t want extra stuff to have to carry around so that really discouraged me ): But when I drive around after grocery shopping for food, or buying myself and my boyfriend a coffee, and I see people freezing outside with nothing it breaks my heart. I’m afraid of insulting anyone because in the past I’ve gotten yelled at for offering someone food, and hit on after buying a homeless guy whatever he wanted from the dollar store. I also tried to take a couple homeless guys to see a movie but they didn’t show up the next day when I went to meet them. I was going to drop them off, buy their tickets and some popcorn, and then let them watch the movie together. Then after I drove around looking for them and couldn’t find them, someone told me that was stupid because they could have hurt me. 

What are some options I have? Here are my thoughts/ideas if someone could set me straight. Thank you in advance

I realized I had some clothes I wasn’t using or that I grew out of. I intended to give some to my boyfriend’s kids but one of them is too young for my size and the other is already larger than I am. I have stuff like a couple warm puffy jackets, some sweaters, and other random clothes. I’m 140 lb female, so my clothes are pretty small and probably wouldn’t be much help to some so I feel a little silly considering it and don’t want to come off as rude if I don’t have clothes to fit them.

I also have some stuff like unused disposable razors and shaving cream that I was using for my dad when I was taking care of him before he died. I was thinking of buying some toothpaste and toothbrushes, some deodorant wipes, maybe baby wipes, idk. 

Then I thought that I would like to give away some food, too. Maybe fruit snacks, chips, granola bars, small stuff that won’t go bad right away.

I don’t know if it’s safe to walk up to someone because I don’t want to offend them and I don’t want to get yelled at or stalked which has happened in the past. I considered wrapping some shoe boxes full of useful stuff and leaving them for someone to find. But I want to make sure they don’t get missed and blown away or tossed, I want them to go to people who really need them.

Sorry for this convoluted mess. If anyone can help I would appreciate it.",2022-12-23 21:50:32,2022,12,23,21,50,32

Suffered a lot being so detached from reality as I was, but at the same time I have to say that those three years were not only the best thing for me, but they were also some of the best years of my life thus far. I want to share some of my insights as to why this is, so that you might lessen your suffering while living without a place to rest your head that you can call your own.


First off, you gotta have a mission; something you can immerse yourself in to do meaningful things and whittle away at the long hours out of doors. A person without a mission is just sitting around waiting to die. If you are invested in something greater than yourself, you will find the strength to keep putting one foot in front of the other. Definitely assuages the pain of depression and addiction and apathy.


Because I was mad during this period of my life, I always felt like I had something I had to do. Usually this involved picking up trash or exercising or writing or doing performance art, but as everyday was its own self-contained episode of synchronous hijinks, I would frequently try new things. That is another key point I want to make; break as many patterns of behavior and other habits that make your life feel comfortable. Not only is this critical in the healing process as it is the primary means to recondition yourself out of the old you, but when each day is filled with novelty, that greatly decreases the agony of feeling trapped in a prison of unending negativity. It just makes life feel like it's worth living to the fullest, which brings us to my next point.


You have to have some connection to a higher power. Now, as insane as I've been, I am still a highly rational person. I don't believe in traditional depictions of God, which is fine because you don't need to in order to receive strength from your faith. If you do find peace in normative versions of the divine, more power to you, but I find the same bliss in my belief that there is a functional alien hivemind guiding humanity. It's strange, but it works. It gives me a worldview where everything is working as intended and that I have a role to play in the big picture. Truly, you need to find something that gives you a purpose and the willpower to be the best version of yourself that you can be.


That said, I've found that living a life dedicated to kindness, compassion, and selfless service grants a profound sense of happiness in your life. When you put a smile on someone's face, suddenly your suffering becomes smaller. When you know that you're an agent of love and light, you can shrug off the little things easier, as you will see yourself as more valuable, which in turn boosts your outlook on everything.


Finally, I want to return to something I've already touched on. Your spiritual work is vital to your success and well-being. For reference, I consider spiritual work to be the things you do to better yourself and evolve your framework so you have the best perspective that you can muster. I've felt lost and hopeless before, but with much effort I improved my position in life and climbed out of such dark pits. You know what kicked off that transformation? I taught myself to juggle. It was the perfect activity for me to sink my time into and helped create opportunities moving forward. You have to find something that inspires you to work and work hard. Do what you love, and have faith that it is worth it to keep on with your self-improvement. 


That's all I have to share at this juncture in time. No, I lied. One last parting of words before I go. Being in the types of positions that lead to homelessness often results in feeling unloved and unwanted. So, I hope that I can help you see that you are in fact loved. If you don't get told it that often, let me tell you that I love you, cousin. I may not know you, but I care about you, and I'm not the only one. Across my bizarre journey, I've met a plethora of people that are full of love. Likewise, I've found that I can find them by spreading love as much as I can. You never know who someone is before they open themselves up, but you should believe that you are worthy of all the love in the world. Keep up with what I mentioned in this post and you'll find that you'll feel the abundance of good vibes present in the garden. Best wishes, friends. May fortune smile upon you.",2022-12-22 18:18:38,2022,12,22,18,18,38

zsls8a,6,Vallejotacoz,3,homeless,My friendly town magician also woke up homeless on Christmas Day,"There is a magician in my town who is 50 who ever since I would be in downtown more and be around the junior college in the early 2010s after I graduated from HS, would be often seen walking around the jc library and just general downtown. I was sure he was carless but wasn’t sold from that alone that he was homeless. 

He usually looks well dressed in suits and dress shirts and is  clean and he performs magic tricks downtown, sometimes the “ball behind your ear” trick and in live shows he does the sawing a woman trick, etc. He isn’t bad, not the best but he does shows around the North Bay Area of Northern California and sometimes if lucky San Francisco. 

In 2013 a murder happened where two homeless men, one only 22, had a fight escalating into a brutal stabbing. The 22 year old died, and this was on Christmas night, and the murder happened over really nothing (sus thought victim was previous robber and came up to him apparently angrily). 

The magician heard the screams and it was on a court report he was homeless and slept behind a library stairwell… on Christmas Eve. And had to hear a horrific murder. The magician was a little over 40 at the time. 

Imagine that. Maybe he’s done something bad before but he seems like a very nerdy, quirky guy who can make you laugh. He finally got a job at Home Depot as a cashier thank god. 

But imagine your town magician who also is jolly and happy performing at elementary schools; kids sometimes send their teacher or whoever letters about the magician or addressed to him because they valued his shows. This guy that the local news covered on just a month or two prior to his homeless stints, praising his acts and looking forward to another show. 

No, he still ended up on a cold Northern California street in a sleeping bag. Who were the friends of his on Facebook and his magic show assistants. Not blaming them, maybe they were full on Christmas Eve. No help for a hotel?

Christmas may be another day for many but still. Wow this is awful. Glad he made out of it at least and he apparently has a room, no car

It is true most magicians don’t make a lot but even then he didn’t deserve that, and he seemed to be kind of popular at one point. Maybe some bills he owed or a divorce or who knows; awful.",2022-12-22 06:12:10,2022,12,22,6,12,10

zs9gn7,0,MillenialMatriarch,5,homeless,seeking feedback on a resource concept,"Location: semi rural South NJ, USA

I live and work in a county with total population around 150k. Point in Time homeless count was 82 last year (up from a consistent 30-35 pre-covid). Many are chronically homeless. 

Code blue here is about 10 years established, with waning volunteer pools. Two local churches offer showers.  Several with once a week feeding. One with daily lunch.  There are limited to no spaces for daytime services/support in the area. (Counting sympathetic librarians and VOA). Our one shelter is remote and is a bad fit for most of our chronically homeless. 

My concept idea: The Day Center, a place to be.

What it is: A membership based home- like environment with access to a kitchen,  showers,  laundry and community closet/commissary, personal storage, a living room with television and games,  and a ""quiet enjoyment library"" with reading materials wherein people would be free to nod off as they ""read"". The building I have in mind is situated within a block of our local Social security office, county jail, Courthouse, and administrative buildings.  

How it works: monthly sliding scale""memberships"", and additional day passes with acceptance of shared use guidelines,  including commitments to non aggression,  quiet enjoyment, and cleanliness. No other requirements for entry. Membership may be revoked or suspended for intentional violence or disruption, but may also be reinstated at a later time. Sponsorships would be encouraged to maintain membership for known chronically homeless neighbors.  

Open 7am to 7pm. Due to limited capacity (roughly 20 at a time), individuals would enter on timed passes with each check in OR First in, first out as patrons arrive through the day after reaching capacity.  Weapons and intoxicating substances left at the coat check along with health screening.  Showers encouraged at entry, potentially required if one is especially soiled. Other services may include: appointment and recertification reminders, referral to social service agencies, arranging transportation. No on-site social services or requirement of engagement with such. Agency partners may come in to promote or screen for services from time to time.

Staffed by volunteer and paid stewards, possibly members elected to these positions. These would be active accountable persons with the ability to assist individuals in accessing their belongings in storage or using facilities.  May need to regulate entry, exit, and activity within facilities. On the whole members would be given vote or influence in house rules and activities.  This makes for an opportunity to build an intentional community over another social service entity. 



My questions: 

Would you utilize a space like this? How often?

What is a reasonable rate of general affordability? Hourly? Daily? Monthly? 

What concerns or considerations would you have?



I'm also asking local unhoused friends their ideas on the concept, but most have had no interaction with a day shelter model, because most have only been homeless here. The places I've seen or researched for daytime only service seem much like large soup kitchens, or social service agencies- being very sterile or prescriptive of activity.",2022-12-21 19:27:04,2022,12,21,19,27,4

zrz1n5,5,Faketrees2223,17,homeless,Shelter vs Winter camp,"I've been staying at a shelter for about 2 months now. It's in a smaller city. There's plenty of food from the churches, at least one meal per day. The shelter isn't so bad. Laundry and showers available during the week. Donated toiletries. Donated clothes. But lot's of fights that don't involve me and open drug use. I'm a recovering addict and an alcoholic. I'm finding it tough to stay even moderately sober. I also suffer from psychosis and the collective stress isn't good for my voices. A few days ago, someone's blood wound up on my hand from somewhere. This morning I woke up to an uncapped, dirty rig inches from my face.

I've been considering leaving the shelter and building a camp. I can get some old belongings mailed to me from a friend. A tent, sleeping bags, and a camp stove. I'm a pretty solitary person and have done winter camping before. It'll get to -40'C here in February but I don't see it as an issue. There's a library here I can go to warm up at. The site I have picked out is near public available restooms too.

Is this a silly idea though? I feel like my mental health problems will heal faster if I'm off by myself. Or am I just kidding myself? Is it better to not risk freezing to death?

Edit: after much deciding, I'm going to go for it. My sleeping bags are rated for the cold I'm going to experience here. Plus my stove. I'll be alright. If my stuff gets stolen I can always return to the shelter.",2022-12-21 12:57:54,2022,12,21,12,57,54

My grandparents have been nice enough to take me and my father in, and my older sister has been taking in my mother and younger sister, but that won't last long. My nana has recently passed away and were struggling to keep the house up with my grandfather, it's moulding and has extreme leaking coming from the loft.

So just a little background on him, he is currently 25 years old and he will be taken off my parents health insurance when he turns 26. We had found him an apartment ever since he got out of prison when he turned 24 since he was locked up for 6 years before that. He was playing games with the landlord and stopped paying and was avoiding contact with him and our family.

Recently he finally got kicked out of there before the matters got taken to court and has been trying to live at homeless shelters but gets kicked out of them because he can’t follow there rules. 

The past 5 days he ended up faking his sickness to stay 5 nights at the hospital just so he can have a place to stay and doesn’t realize that it costs so much money to spend even 1 night at a hospital.

Please keep in mind that he is delusional, he has mental illness and believes in God to an extent that shouldn’t be believed in. (Cult like religious beliefs ever since he got out of prison)

He won’t get a job even thought we have helped him in every possible way we can. We tried getting him to go to the army but he says he’s not ready but I don’t even know if they will except him at his age.

I only met this neighbor in passing for maybe a minute or two (I often walk a couple times a day, usually not much further than two miles due to health issues).

Anyhow, our conversation was short, but seemed enjoyable and both of us headed in different directions. I asked what was needed and where I could leave the supplies and the person was fairly excited about the exchange and instructed me on where to drop them off at.

Eventually, once I got rested enough I got back out and did so hours later, but so far they’ve not been touched.

I’ve only got a name/nickname to go by and have checked local arrest records just incase since, this person did mention squatting and avoiding the shelters, which I understand.

Can’t recall ever crossing paths before and I do walk the area daily, multiple times, but my memory is pretty terrible.

I suppose the best option for now is to just keep waiting it out? The individual did mention a need to find another spot soon.

zqtadx,29,Vagabond2805,8,homeless,Deadly weather in the midsouth this weekend,"this Friday, in the mid south US, there's a brutal cold coming in. the temp will drop to 7 degrees. now I know some of you out there may be like ""it gets much colder than that where I live."" and you may be right. but the temp itself isnt the issue. at 12:30 am Thursday night (or Friday morning depending on your point of view since it is after midnight) the temperature will be in the mid 50s where I am currently. and by 3:30am, just 3 hours later, it's going to rapidly drop to the single digits. the human body has an amazing ability to adapt to extreme temperatures, so while you won't enjoy it, it's certainly possible to survive these conditions. but the problem is the speed of the change offers no chance to adapt. Combined with a -10 wind chill, this is deadly weather if you're outdoors. if you are currently in the east/midsouth us, take care to take all the precautions you can so you don't end up a corpsesicle by morning. make sure you have a warm bedding and stay off the ground. if you don't have something between your body and the ground you might just die. if I have funds to rent a hotel for a few nights, maybe consider it.  I don't so wish me luck lol. and most importantly, if you are shivering violently and freezing, but suddenly get warm and very sleepy, DO NOT go to sleep. you won't wake up if you do. do whatever you can to stay warm this weekend. if you're further north, I dont know the weather conditions, but you're probably already cold. hopefully you aren't also expecting a rapid drop in temp from what's probably alelready near or at single digits anyway, but if you are, this applies even more to you. remember, very low temperatures are extremely dangerous to those of us exposed to them, but a sudden huge drop in temp is far more dangerous as you have no change to get used to it. stay safe out there.",2022-12-20 09:50:56,2022,12,20,9,50,56

I’ve been sleeping in my SUV. On the side of this road near a park; it’s usually pretty quiet and there are other folks doing the same thing there.

Last friday, while i was laying in the back of my car, a drunk(on drugs?) driver ran into my car and totaled it. He hit me so hard that it moved my car into the guys van in front of me(also homeless), which fucked up his van supremely as well. His might be totaled too. For both of us, that’s all we had. Our livelihood. That wasn’t just our car it was our home too. I have so much shit in there that I can’t get out, because even if I did i’d have nowhere to put it. I’m lucky that I wasn’t killed and made it out with only a minor bruise but that shit was crazy and I can’t stop thinking about it.

I started my new job that I had lined up today, but it’s so much harder now. I don’t have my car and only a fraction of my belongings in a small backpack and I can’t stay in motels forever. I’m still not sure what I’m gonna do. I worked so fucking hard to get this job(it pays decent), and right before i’m finally supposed to start this happens to me. 

I want so badly to go fuck that guy up. The motherfucker was so fucked up on whatever he was on he couldn’t even speak a single sentence straight. And this fucking cunt was driving and ran into me. Then had the audacity to get out and start saying slurs to me. I’ve done fucked up shit in my life. I wouldn’t lose sleep if i found him and beat his kneecaps into shards. The cops let me take a picture of his ID so i have his address. He’s probably still in jail now, but i want SO BADLY to go fuck that guy up. I’m trying to remind myself that I need to be forgiving and be a good person even though he’s not. It’s hard.

I bounced around between rehabs, psych wards, halfway houses a long term homeless shelter and finally starting about 17 months ago transitional housing.  A year ago after being turned down for many jobs because of my record which on top of being felonies makes it obvious I have addiction issues, I landed a job back in my field, they made me do grunt work general labor for 3 months to prove myself before getting me on a machine (I'm a CNC machinist) I was buried in debt that was all in collections from maxing out a lot of credit cards at the end largely on lawyers and trying to hold on after I lost my job do to the legal issues my credit was destroyed as well.  I've managed to pay off the majority of the debt and got my credit score up high enough that I was approved for an apartment with a large deposit.  I'm pretty much wiped out because of the deposit and first month rent, but I'll recover in a few months, I know how to live cheap to get money back in my account. I move in 3 weeks to a pretty nice normal apartment very close to my work in a much better neighborhood then I've been in most of the last 3 years.

Some people delete their post because they think its embarrassing or a bad reason for being homeless. And that's fine. But I think it is good to share your story, long or short, if you can for many good reasons, and for the greater good of all.

For me, its for many reasons, and for many times on and off.

I cant work or live a 9 to 5 life for politicians and other things that I don't like or support, its usually because of a moral issue about what these things are (predators, exploiters, corrupt, etc) even though I do love working 24/7. This issue is the same for income tax, as it is robbery and tyranny so I try to avoid it as much as possible. So instead, I work odd jobs for money, or just work for myself and others for free, usually all under the table. And so I am without money for long periods of time.

Additionally I like travelling and living free. Since a child I've always traveled freely. Going to and hanging out in different places in and out of town/city. As I grew up I expanded to different cities, then states. But I've never been out of my country (america is surrounded by only 2 other country and water so I cant just walk or hitchhike outside easily).


Once on the run. I was on the run once and that was the longest I was homeless (6 months). It was also the toughest because I couldn't just do whatever.

Those are my main reasons for being homeless on and off my whole life. But Iv never had a drug problem or hardcore mental illness problem (except being against the 9 to 5 life working for politicians and such, which is considered a mental illness by those things and their so called experts). I assume, because I don't have a drug problem or other hardcore mental illness, that's probably why I can stop being homeless somewhat easily when I want to.

This question is partially to find out why some people stay homeless for so long. Especially if they don't have a drug or mental illness problem. Is it a choice, unfortunate events, some other problem?",2022-12-17 18:06:41,2022,12,17,18,6,41

The last couple times we thought we found a place, horrible things happened. We lost thousands of dollars on a camper that ended up having a hidden mold problem- hospitalizing us both. We found a small apartment that we never got to stay a single night in because we got robbed immediately and had our car vandalized. We found another house and the landlord would only accept money orders for rent. After we put rent/deposit/pet fee onto three separate money orders as requested, he decided to not rent the house. Since we had filled them out already, we had a hard time cashing them out and it ended up taking almost a month to get our cash back.

Things are looking up, but now I'm scared. I won't be comfortable with it until everything is in writing and signed and paid and I'm sleeping in my own bed. I'm so terrified of getting my hopes up and having something stupid happen yet again. I'm tired of being cold, I'm tired of sleeping in uncomfortable car seats, I'm tired of worrying about a cop beating on my windows with a flashlight and demanding I leave, or someone robbing me.

My next biggest fear? Losing the house after we get it. Getting behind on bills. Getting evicted. The house has a 6mo lease....

The coldest weather I have ever experienced was around -2 degrees below zero. I can't imagine being out in temperatures colder than that. Northern parts of the United States will see it. Seek help during this holiday time as much as you have to. People are more willing to help during this time of year and with an artic outbreak coming in.

After my wife passed away from Cancer back in May, I was fortunate enough to have some left over out of insurance money. I saved that money, which I was glad I did after having no choice but to move out of my mountain home due to the owner selling the property. I relocated back to her hometown area in another state. It took every bit of those savings to do that move. If I never had that extra money, I would have been in the homeless situation too. It can happen to anybody. Folks working and living check to check are just a few checks away from being homeless. They keep spending that money on foolishness though. They just don't realize what can happen to put them into the homeless situation.

I was thinking about the unfortunate ones who are homeless due to unknown circumstances when I heard about the arctic air on the way today. Do what you have to in order to survive it. You can freeze or become very sick from this. Please don't let young children go through this. Get them some shelter somewhere. Be safe and stay safe.",2022-12-16 16:07:19,2022,12,16,16,7,19

He got money from the person purchasing it. I was unaware of this, I was going to cut him a bit off as a finders fee. Instead he ditched with around 500 dollars. I cut the card off after waiting for several hours. None of the money was spent.

I'm waiting on the replacement card now, the problem is, my name was obviously on the original card. I'm now being followed by this guy and his friends saying I'm on the hook for the money, or I need to leave town. Leaving isn't an option, there's already one guy living at the shelter who's associated with them.

They say I can come through with the card, and I'll receive some money. Thing is, I obviously don't want to do this at all, and I didn't lose these people's money. I can't exactly go to the police with these threats, and I'm not sure if there are any other viable solutions.

Many of the people here have full time jobs but housing is so expensive in this town that they are forced to stay here at the shelter. 

I've also heard horror stories about shelters, but I must say this one is very clean and the other people here for the most part get along very well. I'm not saying there is not any drama, occasionally people will argue, but that is most likely due to the fact that there are so many people here, all undergoing the stress of being homeless, it can take a toll on person.

Homelessness is not easy. I have been there. It takes people coming in sometimes to pull people out. There is a large homeless community around my new job. I am building out 24 homeless kits and need some advice.

This is the list of items I will be purchasing from amazon.

[https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/125ZXG98TKO5T?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/125ZXG98TKO5T?ref_=wl_share)

I am getting some items from dollar tree as well. I spoke with a few people in my area, and some personal requests were puzzle books, pencils, led for pencils, drawing pads, light weight books, shoe laces, emergency blankets, socks (almost everyone), bookbags, chap stick, moisturizers, blankets (Almost everyone), small towels, and umbrellas.

My target goal is 24 people and under 1000. At the moment I'm at $844. I am in South Carolina. Here is what I planned so far for each kit:

&#x200B;

|Product|Count|area of help|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Beanie Hat|1|head|
|Blanket|1|body|
|Book Bag|1|weight|
|Cable Ties|2|organization|
|chap stick|2|lips|
|drawing pad|1|mind|
|eblankets|2|body|
|face towels|2|health|
|face tube|1|face|
|large gloves|1|hands|
|led refills|1|mind|
|pencils|2|mind|
|shoe laces|2|feet|
|lotion|1|body|
|thermal socks|2|feet|
|umbrella|1|body|
|Deodorant|1|Smell|
|Wash Kits (maybe)|3|Smell|

I am able to get tooth brushes and tooth paste at dollar tree as well. But I don't know how that will work out. I'm trying to keep the bags light and with extra space for their things.

Should I get travel tooth brushes and travel tooth paste? How about deodorant, if so, what type? Water bottles, suggestions?

I want to make as much of an impact as possible, but I'm not to sure how. I am going to print out the survival guide and make a small book out of it for each bag.

Remove if not allowed please. Thank you for your help.

zll8hl,12,Dry_Personality2217,12,homeless,I feel like a total fuck up and I'm sick of it.,"I'm sick if feeling like s total failure. No matter what I do i always end up back on the streets. I've been living on and off full time homeless since about 2008-2009. My husband and i recently had a great place to call home with 4 walls and a door we could lock but shit went south and we had to bounce so back to the streets. While we were there we acquired a pregnant Female pitbull named Precious she had 12 puppies her and I did the whole puppy thing, that was hard as fuck and there was lost of sweat and tears shed yada yada yada. We kept one of the puppies Buddy Jr. He is now 1.5. 
 Shit went south and we ended up back on the streets. Precious and Buddy absolutely love it out here in the riverbottom. It was summer when we hit the streets so of course we went to our summer home under the bridge. We acquired an old and kinda run down RV as a gift and we moved it out into the desert surrounding the bridge after summer was gone. The past 6 months I have been working full time at FedEx and I'm not home alot. My husband also has his own thing he's got going so he's also gone alot as well. We learned that it's damn near impossible keeping precious and Buddy inside the RV when we are gone and they developed a habit of roaming. Well i have been tirelessly trying to find a way to get precious spayed for the last year and a half. I haven't been able to find a legit low cost clinic that is any less than $300 after all is said and done and living paycheck to paycheck that's just not feasible. Buddy is also unaltered and guess what happened???? Yup she's pregnant!!!!!! I told my husband after her last heat that i was near positive she was and he told me I was tripping, I was just looking for something new to bitch about, blah blah blah. Whelp here we are middle of winter and she's big as a house her tits are hanging low and he sure as fuck can't deny it now. More often than not I fucking hate it when I'm right. 
This is total bullshit. I'm fucked because it's fucking hard as fuck raising a litter if puppies. Her last litter was 12!!! Granted she will do most of the work for the first 4 weeks but I still have to figure out #1 WHERE THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT A WHELPING BOX IN AN RV THATS BARELY BIG ENOUGH FOR US NOW!!!! #2 HOW AM I GOING TO KEEP GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW MANY NEWBORN PUPPIES WARM ENOUGH TO STAY I have no heat dont even have most of the windows in the back half  the front half of my RV leaks when it rains i just have blankets and plywood tacked up to keep it somewhat half ass not freezing. 

I feel so guilty because it's my responsibility to get my dogs fixed but it's expensive as fuck. I did get a voucher once but it was way way far at 7:30 am and of course the truck wouldn't start and we missed it FMR. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I know that my husband and I'll figure it out and pull it out of one our asses at the last minute like we always do. I'm just scared what if we don't. I can't let her down or her puppies. I already did by not getting her fixed before she got pregnant. I'm just venting and looking for suggestions I guess. I entertained the idea of building some sort of an insulated dog house it side but there's a pretty big coyote population here so no. I've also been thinking maybe i should look into giving her up... It's apparent that I'm not equipped for a litter of puppies. We did fine last time but that was different.  I know that i would never forgive myself and neither would Buddy Jr that's his Mama they are closer than my butt cheeks. 
Any suggestions or advice is welcome. I don't really know why I even wrote this i guess. I just wanted get it off my chest",2022-12-14 01:02:32,2022,12,14,1,2,32
zlh4uv,11,veryberryblue,14,homeless,I have some very specific questions about Cali.,"If a person wanted to start completely from scratch...clean slate...nothing but the shirt on thier back and wanted to settle down somewhere in Cali, how exactly would they do that?.

Obviously, you would need a bus ticket or you would have to hike/train-hop to get out there in the first place but then what?.

I read that before you can get any type of assistance (ie; cash, stamps, medical, etc), you have to have lived in Cali for at least 30 days. How do I prove that though?. Hang onto receipts or something?.

Also, I'm very confused about the whole shelter/pantry/day-station thing. I thought you could just walk in but apparently they have these outreach workers and homeless advocate people out there that give you a referral and thats how you get into a shelter (I guess?).

Also, what do the shelters require of you in order to get in?. Do they just help anyone who needs it or is there a long application process, background check, waiting list, 10 different pieces of ID, references and a bunch of other hassles and red tape?. Do you just go to the shelter/pantry or do they have advocates who come out, find you a shelter and drive you to it?. I mean, how helpful are they actually?.

Is it possible to just go to places in Cali, get found by an outreach team, get taken to a shelter, get assigned a social worker, get into a motel or more permenant housing and get other types of assitance with no issues or do you just have to be one of the few ""lucky ones""?.

For context my mom is a drug addict and my dad hasn’t talked to me since I was a child, I’ve been in and out of Homeless shelters and friends houses since I was a pre teen, I know my way around it and can get shelter if I need it but my boyfriend and his brothers’s parents don’t have citizenship. The kids have American citizenship the parents only have Mexican citizenship. In 6 days if we can’t find another place then the parents will go back to Mexico and leave the kids up here to fend for themselves because the parents state in Mexico is extremely dangerous and they have no family or stability down there and can’t support 3 kids down there. My boyfriend has his own car it’s an suv and we don’t have many belongings other than clothes. Me and my boyfriend get our work permits signed this Friday and will apply everywhere that we can, until then we have food stamps and about 200$ in savings, and As far as I know if they go to a youth shelter without parents in the country they’ll be taken to border camps for kids who’s parents have been deported and/or foster care and we will do anything in our power to prevent that, I have been in foster care myself and it’s horrors beyond imagination, and from what I’ve seen photos of and interviews of, the border camps for kids have them sleeping on tin foil blankets and it can take years to get them placed in a foster home or group home and so many kids there “disappear”.  There’s two safe parking programs that I know of in San Diego for people living out of their cars, dreams for change and Jewish family services, the Jewish one seems like they’d need ID or drivers license based on what they said on the phone interview (which not one of us have) and dreams for change is more low key I don’t think they’d need ID but there’s a 1 month+ waiting list. I guess I’m just asking that if any of u know any other safe parking programs or ways that we could stay at youth shelters without my boyfriend and his brothers being taken into custody because of their parents. My step dad lives at a sober living so we can’t stay there or the parking lot but he can help me by buying us baby wipes and soap and toothbrushes and food if we run out type of things so me and my boyfriend could maintain hygiene for job interviews next week. Our plan right now I guess is to survive as long as we can in the car and get a job as soon as a possible and find some shady studio or one bedroom on Craigslist that doesn’t need credit or documentation’s as long as we can give extra money type thing. The 16 year old will also hopefully be getting a job too soon so we’ll have three combined incomes. Any advice or resources welcome",2022-12-13 19:30:28,2022,12,13,19,30,28

she gets food stamps and makes some money through less than desirable means but spends it on her kids needs/hotels about as fast as she makes it. she wants to find a more stable job and save to start renting but cant find a way to work and still watch her kids. shes currently trying to sell her car so she has enough money to put towards rent. she says she has a place lined up with another homeless mother just needs a deposit i think.

She lives in florida, in or around the villages iirc. are there any resources or advice i can give her to help her out?",2022-12-11 17:23:23,2022,12,11,17,23,23

6. Dating. I miss companionship. It's near impossible to date in our circumstances.
7. Privacy: It sucks having zero privacy.

Not having a pet feels like the ultimate punishment from the universe. One of the first things I'll do when I'm housed is to adopt another one. I miss my old boy so much. When I moved into my car. The first few nights, I confess to crying my eyes out not being able to see my boy. I was depressed thinking about him because I raised him. Giving him up for adoption hurt my soul.

So an emergency radio like this with a hand crank (and solar panel but don't expect to charge it in any reasonable time) would prove to be quite useful when disaster strikes and you lost power or when you simply don't have any easy way to get power. And of course you can also charge it like a normal phone though the usb port.

I did this last year around this time, but wanted to make sure I get people what they really need/want so I’d love to hear from you guys. I did research but I’d honestly prefer hearing from you directly. 

Last year the packs I made were in zip lock gallon bags and included:
- Socks
- Hand warmers and feet warmers (4 for hand, 4 for feet)
- Bandaids
- Instant packs of coffee
- Masks
- Soft chocolate candy 
- Salty snack (like Cheez-it’s)
- Hand sanitizer 
- Wipes
- Slim Jims 
- $5 bill per pack (I know it’s not a lot, but it’s all I could give per pack based on income)

I think there might have been one or two more things in there but I can’t fully remember.

My main questions if you don’t mind answering are:

1. What kind of snacks would you personally like to receive? I want to get something nutritious and that you’d actually want as opposed to just junk if that’s not helpful. 
2. What kind of socks do you prefer that could potentially be bought in bulk (unfortunately I can’t afford the really good $20 per pair kind, but I also don’t want to get the flimsy cheap ones either cause I know those aren’t going to do anything, so I’d love to hear if anyone has a favorite brand or go to that is maybe an in between. Best bang for your buck type of thing.) 
3. Are hand warmers and foot warmers good for a pack? 
4. Masks/hand sanitizers still helpful? 
5. Cash or gift cards? 

Anything else you’d like to add or any advice I’d love to hear.

zbobtv,19,bongart,17,homeless,"I'm going to talk about me, for a bit.","For those who don't know... Slab City has taken homelessness in a slightly different direction, and it isn't for everyone.

But the title says I'm going to talk about myself.  Plenty won't give a shit... many of whom I myself have alienated with long comments, or preachy ideals.  I get it.  I've at least shown that for better or worse, I'm not stupid... so I get it.  I don't expect to ever be a cup of tea the majority would enjoy.

I am an individualist.

>an advocate of a social theory favoring freedom of action for individuals over collective or state control

This also includes individual responsibility... freedom of action most definitely **does not mean** freedom from consequences.  This is also NOT just another way of saying Anarchist.  It doesn't mean there should be a lack of collective or state control/regulation... it means that these things should favor the individual over the collective.  It comes up in silly ways... like... there shouldn't be tax breaks, just because someone gets married, because that puts the incentive on becoming a group over becoming the best individual one can.

Individualism doesn't mean one can't work more efficiently as part of a group and do more work.  It means one assesses what they do to ensure that they \*are\* efficiently contributing to the group.  An Individualist won't follow the mass, just because the mass is going that way.  Individualists don't follow trends.  Individualists get jobs, and prove to either be problematic when part of a team, or they end up altering the team to better recognize the individual strengths within it.  You don't make EVERYONE stock the heavy stuff, just because it is their turn... you have the strongest in the team do the heaviest lifting.  Is it fair?  Maybe not to the collective itself... but it is fair to the individuals within it, because playing to strengths would take a load off of those strong individuals in other ways within the team.  Tanks tank.

Being homeless teaches me how to better recognize and appreciate the difference between what I want, and what I need.  What I **need**... is food, water, a place to relieve myself, electricity, and a box to keep out most of the weather.  **That is it**.  That's all \***I**\* need, to be able to find moments of happiness.  And, for the most part, I can string together enough moments of happiness to cover the time I spend awake.  I say ""for the most part"" because I do live in a world that makes me angry when I look at it long enough.  Maybe I read too much science fiction as a kid, and I saw what mankind \*could\* be... and now I can't ever get that image out of my head.  Mankind definitely doesn't live up to my expectations.. but I am smart enough to know that my expectations are just that.... MINE and no one else's.  Even if others do share them.....they have theirs and they just look like mine.  I **know** mine are unrealistic for actual human nature... know it for a fact.  Knowing it, doesn't make it any easier when I see the world as it is, and all the ways ***I think*** it could be, simultaneously all... the... time.

So... I limit how much of the world I pay attention to.  I'd be a hermit in the middle of a city, living in my box with electricity, if I could connect with the job that would let me.  It isn't the fault of the system... it is my fault for my choices along the way, to where I am older with no viable career choices.... and employment options generally put me in direct competition with younger people who will be able to do that job better.... specifically because it is largely unskilled labor.  And again... I know that this is my fault for not being able to plan for my future better when I should have.  When I should have been planning for my future, I still didn't really know the difference between a dream and a plan.

When I graduated, the reason why I didn't go to the Berkley School of Music in Boston was because I didn't write the essay for the application.  Again, for better or worse, I can write essays like people have conversations... all day and at length.  I didn't write that essay, because I didn't think I belonged at that school.  See... I can't sight read.  That means I cannot look at a new piece of written music, and just play it as it is.  I can play, compose, and arrange... but I have to sit with that piece of music and work with it, before I memorize the passages and use the written music as a reference guide... or I have to hear it first.  That means I'd never pass the jury just to get into a music college, since that's one of the things they do.  You get sat down in front of strange/unfamiliar music, and you are required to play it.

Now... I probably should have just written it, because this was 1987, and that would have put me in Boston, in a music college, playing the Trombone when Ska became a thing and bands like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones came into existence.  I'm not saying I would have been good enough to play in that band... but it would have been like being in a grunge band in the Northwest, when grunge was just beginning  to be a thing.  I've just never been any good at imagining my own future in a realistic sense, over any kind of dream or fantasy.  \*I\* wanted to play the bass.  That's the route I followed.  I just didn't know then that what I really wanted..... was to arrange and compose.  I don't want to be a performer... I used to have to wear sunglasses on stage so I could close my eyes and block out the audience.  I stayed in a band once, because we never played out... we'd get together, and instead of writing and practicing pieces to get them perfect for performances, we'd jam for a couple of hours and go home.  We'd create these new constructs, work them out into something coherent on the fly, explore them for a few minutes... and then do it again in a different way.  We talked about wanting to get gigs... but none of us would put the effort in, and instead we'd get together three times a week and just play.  For a little more than two years.  I loved it.

Choices.

I've caused myself a lot of trouble over the years, by not knowing how to make better choices for my future.  I'd support  myself with cashier jobs, while I moved from band to band.  I've lived in all four corners of the lower 48... from Maine to Florida, from Washington to southern California, and a bunch of places in-between.  In my late 20's, I figured out that people were part of my problem... and I switched gears and started repairing computers.  I was... 26-27 at the time, that'd be what. 1997-1997.  I was in New Orleans, of all places, to give up on music.  And no... I didn't touch a Trombone once in all the times I've been in New Orleans.  I got a job at the first internet cafe in the French Quarter... and I started getting paid to repair desktops.  I'd done it for free for years before that as a hobby.  I was very proud of the AMD 486-DX133 I was carting around with me with people were just starting to use Pentium P90's and 120's.  Better architecture and processors for sure.... but that DX133 was like an older beefed up, beat-up muscle car being put against newer, sleeker mid-line vehicles.  If you want to compare processors to cars, that is.

I was also carting around a Yamaha controller, and doing multi-track composing with midi and custom soundfonts with realistic samples.  So the synthesized piano track would sound like a piano.. in 1996-1997.  I had cheap equipment I could skip upgrading, and create music I liked to listen to.  At that time, I was closer to realizing how I just need that box.  I didn't need an audience to approve of my creations, for my creations to make me happy.  I didn't need that external validation.  I didn't FULLY realize it then... I only started to.

I moved after the internet cafe closed in 2001.  I stayed with my grandparents and worked for a few months, made enough money to get back to Cape Cod to a seasonal job I knew of that included housing, used the saved money to cover the winter expenses, and did that for a few years, fixing computers on the side.  I chased a few job offers up and down the east coast for computer repair shops, worked independently passing out flyers sometimes... lived out of a van, stayed in a few shelters, got involved for a hellish four years with an old high-school flame from 2009 to 2013... went 3000 miles across the country and homeless again to escape.... and I failed to get any kind of foothold until I got here.

Now... here I am, on a ledge, already over the edge of a cliff.  I used this analogy here very recently.  Any of us who just couldn't make it work and ended up homeless, know that cliff I am talking about.  Actually, even the people who were pushed over that cliff, know about it.  I don't want to directly call it the Cliff of Homelessness, because that almost sounds like a Monty Python skit.  But we know what it is like to try to claw one's way back UP it.  It isn't a hill.  It isn't a mountain.  It isn't even a hole.  It is a cliff.

Once at the bottom of that cliff... it is possible to go sideways and just do things completely differently.  I don't really believe anyone should live naked in the Oregon woods, hunting with a spear and living in a cave... but that is a possibility.  We did it once.  Kinda.  With skins, not naked.  Most of us though, we want back up that cliff.. to how things were, or how they were \*supposed\* to be.  Indoctrination or desire doesn't matter as much when one is in the process of climbing back up.  Realizing the want to get back up is because of indoctrination, only means that much more work changing directions, with no safety net.  Realizing it is only desire, and not need, sometimes makes you want to just let go and fall back down.

I got to a ledge.  You wouldn't think it comfortable, and my choices have made it even harder to proceed up from here.  Getting a job here pretty much requires Spanish as a second language, and I took French (and never learned to think in it) in High School.  And that work is 26 miles away across desert and fields, and I have no license or car of my own.  I have access to an unregistered vehicle that gets used to make gasoline and supply purchases for a neighbor.  There is a single bus which services a stop 4 miles away, but not on a schedule that would work with most jobs.  There would have to be a car involved either getting to work, or getting home from work.  In exchange for forward progress, I can sit on this ledge almost indefinitely.  I have a box... you could have once called it a recreational trailer, but with the way the ceiling is coming down and separating from the wall in one corner, it is getting harder to call a habitable one.  It certainly wouldn't survive being moved.  It isn't mine.  It isn't on land anyone here owns.  I have solar.  I have an outhouse, and access to a tank of water.  I have a job, of sorts.  I earn $6.25 a day, working 7 days a week keeping a neighbor alive.  $200 a month, every day.  I had a day off in June when I went to the hospital in Brawley for dehydration.  I fill and start his generator, I check on him, I do his shopping for him, get the gas, kill the rats, light construction, troubleshooting.... I won't clean for him.  I insisted he pay someone else for that.  I carry a walkie-talkie all the time until midnight.  Out here, you get what you can, not what you should.

I know I have strong feelings about personal accountability.  I work hard at not putting myself into situations that I cannot handle being personally accountable for my actions.  Making sure I have food is my responsibility.  If I have to get the food from Commodities (aka, food bank once a month in the town of Niland, 4 miles away), or I have to make arrangements to get the 33 miles to Imperial, to go to the food bank.... then that is what I have to do.  I have to get a permanent mailing address I can count on so I can sign up again with SNAP.... using General Delivery here, while Calipatria is still handling Niland mail, and they could potentially eliminate postal service to Niland in the future, well..... I can't use General Delivery until I know whether or not to have it sent to Calipatria (which is 12 miles away) or Niland.  Changing a mailing address with social services here is apparently impossible, and why I am not on SNAP currently.  24 miles round trip in the desert, without either transportation, or paying for it with money I don't have... just to get the forms that get sent back with the same information.... let's just say this is the second option I don't want to HAVE to accept.  If I can get a Niland PO box of my own, before any final decision gets made, then it could make the difference between being accessible to me and not.  I recognize the uniqueness of my situation involving my personal details,  a burnt-down post office, and living in a rather hostile desert region.

I believe what I believe, because of what I've read, and learned... seen and heard... over the years.  I'm no different from anyone else in that regard.  I know that sometimes when a person asks for a specific piece of information, I want to delve into the why of it instead.  I've learned over the years, that the problems we see aren't always the problems that need to get solved.  I've learned how to see through most of my wants, to determine whether or not there was need within them.  I've learned that happiness isn't a destination.... it is the scenery on the way.  One can be happy anywhere.  Hell, the human brain contains the capacity to completely disassociate oneself from reality and send one to a happy place in times of extreme trauma.  One can be happy in a moldy tent, with an uncleaned month or two on them, reading a book by flashlight... or even moonlight.  One doesn't have to be happy WITH something, in order to be happy.  One can be unhappy with one's situation, while one is happy reading that book.  Or listening to music.  Or laughing at TikTok videos.  Or watching ducks.

People who say that they just want to be happy..... are either not being honest with themselves, or they are being manipulative in how they go about getting what they want.  What they really mean is that there is something they want, which they believe will MAKE them happy.  It almost never works, which is where the saying ""You can't buy happiness"" comes from.  Things don't make us happy.  WE make ourselves happy.  If we convince ourselves we can't be happy without something, we forget how to find happiness in all the other ways available.  We end up not giving credit to those moments of happiness we DO find... thus ignoring what does **actually** make us happy while we focus on the things we are missing instead.  There's also a connection to ""missing the forest for the trees"" there.

I'm 92% introvert... since we all have some of both in us.  I'm here, so I know I have to have some social contact.  I say things that are contrary sometimes, because I can see a larger picture involved.  I learned from reading Isaac Asimov that humans can be looked at as a single organism, and the general actions and direction of mankind can essentially be graphed out based on past performance.  That it will be possible to predict the next Dark Ages, based on psychoanalysis of the human organism as a whole, instead of just the actions of the individual.  This clashed with my individuality at first, but actually makes sense, because although on the whole, the actions of any one individual cannot be accurately predicted over time, and sometimes these actions can have an affect on the group as a whole... by and large individual actions are errant points on the graph.  I like Probability and Statistics as well... thank the first half of my Senior Year for that.  I can't control the group as a whole.  I can only control me.  I thank my introversion for that.

Maybe this will help some people understand why I am a mix of individuality and support for collective things.  I don't know.  I was born in the state with Hope on the flag, in the village named Hope.... spent the first 18 years of my life living on Hope Furnace Road.  Hope... is painful.  To quote Malcolm Reynolds ""***I ain't lookin for help from on high.  That's a long wait for a train don't come.***""  I try not to wish, and I try not to hope.  I accept, or I alter.  If I cannot alter, I do what I need to accept.  If I cannot accept, I alter what I need to.  And I know as humans, we are all capable of this.",2022-12-03 12:28:29,2022,12,3,12,28,29

z5eo69,53,bongart,27,homeless,Here's something that can help with the cold.,"Alrighty.  For all of us out here who have time on our hands, inadequate gear for the weather, and strange odds and ends that have collected over time in bags and boxes... here's a way to stay warmer, longer, when ""exposed"" to the elements living in a tent, or even on the street.  Although... if you are on the street, you might want to modify this.

You know those almost useless ""Emergency Thermal Blankets"" that aren't much more than thin, flexible, reflective material?  Don't use them in the expected way... unfolding and wrapping around oneself.  Instead, take the time to sew one BETWEEN two thin blankets.  You could finally make good use of that cheap sewing kit you picked up somewhere... you could use a length of wire as a needle and use string.  This doesn't have to be a professional job.  But... with time on your hands, you could quilt the motherfucker, sewing the entire thing up into rough two inch squares.  Less crinkling when you move around, and a more solid feel to the new ""comforter"" you just made. if you quilt it.

The point is... you put the thermal blanket between two other fabrics.  This will make the whole thing last longer... MUCH longer.

Want to get crazy?  Put a thermal blanket between two sleeping bags.

The reflective material blocks the transmission of heat.  It isn't insulation, like the poly fill in the sleeping bag.  It is a barrier.  This is why, by itself, it can make you feel warm when you should be dry in a jacket.  The material itself doesn't stand up to direct abuse... thus, the thermal blanket sandwich.

Why sew it all together?  To keep shit from bunching up when you sleep.

A couple of those white Red Cross blankets, the Emergency Human Plastic Foil Wrap, some ""sewing""... and you've got yourself the warmest cover you can imagine.  Except maybe using sleeping bags instead of blankets... but then the whole assembly becomes unwieldy.

Advanced points for putting a thermal blanket between two tarps for overhead shelter.  Use your imagination.  Anywhere you don't want heat going... that Walmart Ozark Trail $3 sheet of reflective plastic could potentially be a gift beyond repayment.  Any way that you can sandwich it between materials... the longer you will make it last.

The ~~Master's~~ Masters Class involves using them to block the heat of the sun to create cooler shelters.

EDIT:  I was going to say something darkly clever-ish about the class not being for masters, but actually belonging to some **fictional** Josh ""Joe Bob"" Master, aka the ""Master"" of emergency thermal blanket usage... but that seemed too convoluted.",2022-11-26 11:43:58,2022,11,26,11,43,58

Already lost my last source of income. I haven't showered in two weeks because I can't go to the the gym. I was able to get a bottle of water which I have been using carefully to clean myself. My hours were cut down to 5 per week. Credit has sunk to hell. So I will never get out of my situation.

z1i7cf,29,Minimum-Historian-66,18,homeless,Scared,This is very new and scary to me my husband and I had permanent housing the last 7 years when our landlord decided to sell it to a flipper. We had five days to get our stuff out or lose it. Top things off the day that we moved out our car broke down we had to leave it behind. Homeless Carless with a small dog I have a 17 year old daughter whom fortunately has a wonderful father that she can stay at most nights and I'm pregnant. We slept in the back of the U-Haul truck the first five nights but had to return it. But that counteracts with saving to move into a spot I do have a full-time job I've worked out for many years but with the price of rentals and not being prepared to have to move it's going to take some time to come up with what's needed to get into a spot and paying for motels kind of depletes the purpose. I'm trying to not look like a complete failure to my daughter. I would never want her to know I slept in the back of U-Haul truck how traumatizing that would be to her. most hours of everyday I'm on the phone calling whatever resources I can find and it all seems to be one giant loophole it keep hearing about these Outreach programs that will get you off the streets fast and into temporary housing and then permanent housing especially if you have a job which I have but I've yet to find one that actually does anything but send you back to square one which is a big circle all I'm asking for is any input on where to go to get off the streets or to get into a car I'm not asking for anything of monetary value just advice maybe a prayer or two. thank you,2022-11-21 19:43:58,2022,11,21,19,43,58

z11tb7,22,Method_Key,13,homeless,im about to be homeless in a few days and i need some advice,i dont really know if i will be homeless or not (im sure i will be) but i would still accept some advice for a place to a shelter or something. As it stands rn I live in tampa fl with my single mom and 3 grandkids kids i love them but after what happened yesterday i dont feel like i have a place i can truly call my home. a little bit of background im 24 yrs old  i have lived with my mother all of my life and during most of it i was always quiet i kept to myself i always tried to respect other ppls boundaries spaces and rules and have never cussed my mother or anything but after yesterday i just cant do it anymore during my 18 years as a teenager my mother would always get on me for stealing things and call me a liar and cuss me and i can understand why back then i had a problem and i didnt notice how bad it was until i turned 19 and i kid you not long story short i ate a entire box of slim jims in 3 days. i think there was like 120 in that box alone when i came to realize my mother is right wtf am i doing to myself is this really how i want to spend my life? i dont wanna end up looking like the biggest disappointment in my family so after i turned 20 and decided to grow up. i started practicing self control to stop myself from taking more than i actually need because not everyone can afford everything and i now understand that im helping a family of 4 around that time my first nephew was already 4 and developing his story his little sister was following behind him and the youngest 1 was still a newborn and i dont want them to end up like me. so for 4 yrs i spent most of my time controlling myself around food and actually started helping around the house i would sweep up the kitchen help mom get the kids ready for school watch out for the kids to get home move sum boxes or furniture around to her liking wash the dishes take the kids for a walk for 30 minutes so she could have a break watch them eat so we make sure they eat all of their food etc and my mom is helping me look for a job we are supposed to be at a job interview tommorow i was so excited. and i will admit im not a perfect human being either sometimes i forget to brush my teeth and put on deordant and stuff but even i still do everything my mom says without talking back getting a attitude and tried to control my anger because my mom would constantly get mad over the smallest thing i do wrong when i make 1 mistake be it small or big she would correct what i do in a smart mouth mannered way like she was annoyed by me and threaten to kick me on the street like she did my sister if i step outta line for 1 second (my sisters fine we just dont talk about her much) when i never meant to hurt her in any way or form possible im just trying to help. but as always as this went on i was getting angrier and more depressed day by day until yesterday i snapped. story goes that the day before my mom had cooked us some chilli for dinner we all got our share we ate and there was still half a big pot of hot chilli on the stove for everyone to enjoy i didnt get anymore bc i was full and went to bed apparently what i didnt know was my mom had saved her chilli in the microwave and the reason i didnt know this was because i never looked in that microwave in the first place and sum1 ate it im not blaming anyone but if she would have told me she was saving sum for later i would have never touched it and told my kids not to either because i know thats her food but she insisted it was me and didnt back down we got into a little screaming match but after that it was over. next few days my big brother bought over 3 cases of diet coke for my mom to enjoy being me i know those sodas are for my mom only shes made it clear that those are for her only so i didnt touch any of em. these particular soda cases tho had 2 long but shallow openings on the top it looks like sum1 grabbed a knife and cut 2 long deep holes on it where you can stick your hand in and grab a soda just like that apparently one of the holes had somehow gotten bigger like someone already grabbed a soda or two and sum were missing from there and it was the way the pack was designed i guessed because they all looked like that when it got here i dont blame other ppl and i thought my mom knew because we usually check the stuff before we put it up but you can probably guess what happened she blamed me as usual and made me look like a fool even though i never touched them bc i understand boundaries and the rules applied to them and threatened to kick me out and well i just lost it we ended getting into a huge argument and i was so angry and frustrated i not only cussed out my mom like she did me but she even tempted me to call the cops and dragged a officer into this over chilli and a soda i never stole now shes planning to evict me and as for me i no longer want to live in this house i wanna live alone the problem once your homeless your just that unless you know what to do first and i dont really have any friends or a phone but i do have a bag with 4 pairs of clothes a blanket basic hygiene stuff and sum food a big bag of raisans 2 breakfast bars some ramen noodles i havent cooked yet and sum rice crispy treats im willing to work full time just to have a place where i can live looking into going to a shelter so i can restart my life off right until i find a place to call home do you guys have any advice. like i said before i love my parents but im sooo done with life in this home. thx for reading this essay it must have been a pain.,2022-11-21 08:31:59,2022,11,21,8,31,59

On the other hand red states are supposedly full of laws that criminalize the homeless, treat them like garbage and have very few resources.

So, if you do find yourself homeless, is it better to be in a blue state or a red one?.

I imagine that if your homeless in the city, your daily life consists of homeless shelters or camping in the woods at night, soup kitchens and thrift shops, gyms and public libraries plus panhandling, dumpster-diving, looking for work or flying a sign.

And I guess if your a homeless vagabond/nomad, your day consists of hopping trains, hitch-hiking, hanging out at truckstops, begging/working for meals at various restaurants, sleeping in the woods or motels, getting to see the country, etc.

I guess if your up there in years or disabled, it's better to be in the city and close to resources and if your young and healthy, maybe being a vag/nomad is a better option. I don't know. Any thoughts on this?. Thank you for reading...",2022-11-08 21:51:57,2022,11,8,21,51,57

ynlv7m,7,m1ssingkeys,2,homeless,"[UPDATE] 18 male arrived and homeless, help","Hello reddit, it has been a few days since I posted
Firstly thank you everyone that gave me advise on what to get done and how to proceed. A lot has happened since then and I figured I could use some advise on what to do next: 
Since the first night which I spent at a bus stop and public bathroom room I have managed to stay off the street. After that first night I went to the NSW communities and justice office and they have been a major help in getting me somewhere to sleep, if anyone needs housing ASAP in Sydney then call LINK2Home they were a massive help and have got me set up in a place that is working with me till at least this Tuesday. Which has been great. Sadly that is where the good ends, the first issue is that the place i am staying in is temporary and i am currently not eligible for housing assistance as i do not posses an income, the staff at the Community and Justice place pointed me towards Centrelink and getting set up with a Jobseeker claim which would allow me to receive a bi-weekly payment until I old get a job. IN theory this is good, in practice it has been painful to jump through the hoops to get it, i have been to there offices (Centerlinks) a few time and on Friday they said it was sent in to be urgently processed due to my situation and i would hear back on whether i got it by Wednesday this week, however i went to check the website today and wouldn’t you know that the claim has been paused due to some missing paperwork that was not need a day ago. They would like to present some sort of document to show i can not be with a guardian or family. This has really pissed me off as i now need to go back to there offices tomorrow and sort this out, but I already explained to the lady who said she noted it down n the claim that i had run away from home and she said that was alright. It’s not that big a deal for me as i left for not the worst reasons but imagine if someone left to escape domestic violence and now they are being asked to get a letter or something from the abusers to say she/he is being abused? That is my current issue to get sorted tomorrow and as soon as that is done i need to find myself some work. I was wondering if anyone on here know the best way to find work in Sydney. I have no prior experience and only to a year 11 education which much limit my options but any advise will help. 
One of my options which is not a “cop out” but something i has always had a passive interest in is the military pathway, i just don’t know what i will do with the stuff i have with me as I can’t take it to basic training and i would only want to use the military as a stepping stone rather than a be all end all. But this is something to think about another time. 
Sorry for the bad grammar/spelling, on account of the late nights and dyslexia

(Addition)
Sorry i forgot to bring is up and i wanted to get some input, but i am sure people are wondering why i left my family and flew 16 hours to Australia and cut contact. I do not really wish to get into the details but the best way to phrase it is a break down of relationships and mental health issues. Allthough it seems i manged nothing close to a clean break as they manged to track me down in about 72 hours due to the limited amount of flights leaving the country we were in and the limited amount of places i could have ended up in. They manged to figure out which city i was in and filled a missing persons report which resulted in a police visit and medical inspection. Luckily after checking my abondended email it seems they have decided to leave to alone and only ask i keep in contact which for now is a hard no. Funny enough when i had talked about feeling with my therapist that very few people who claimed to be my friends in Dhaka would notice i had left it seems i was correct, as i did leave a message behind for them wishing them the best and so forth and of the 7 or so people that i was close with 2 sent message and one of them thinks this is a fun little joke/stunt. Which is both validating and a little disappointing. I knew i was right about the people around me, but i guess on some level i wished it was not true.",2022-11-06 02:46:30,2022,11,6,2,46,30

Between April 2020 - July 2021 I worked a full-time warehouse job. I ended up getting fired when I tested positive for Covid and they wanted me to continue going to work full-time even though I felt really sick and uncomfortable being around people knowing I’m positive.

I tried applying for unemployment soon after that but it never worked out. I wasn’t allowed to apply online for unemployment benefits because EDD California doesn’t let you apply online if you have a history of working in another state which I did at the time. My only other options was to call or mail-in my application. I mailed in my application every month for 6 months straight and they never received my application even though I’m 100% sure I mailed it to the right address every time. So after a month of them never getting back to me after mailing in my first application I started calling the EDD number hundreds of times per day and to this day I’m yet to talk to someone over the phone with EDD. I COULD NOT GET CONNECTED. No matter how many times I call, despite the day of the week or time of the day, it always says they’re full and to call a different time. …it’s now been almost 1 and 1/2 years and still can’t get connected or receive my benefits.

The problem here is that I couldn’t pay my bills. I’m so behind in bills that I had to start sleeping in my car and have since. I’m writing this in my car right now. I can’t sleep properly anymore. I have so much back and shoulder pain. It’s impossible to catch up with my bills and survival expenses at this point when you’re poor and trying to put gas in your car, get food, stay safe, etc. I don’t have anyone in my life. I’m a woman in her 20s and I don’t feel safe at any shelter. All this because I can’t get in touch with unemployment???!!!! I went into the EDD office several times and only once were they able to help me by providing a telephone appointment weeks ahead with an EDD representative. What happened after that? I get a call, I answer, they immediately hang up, and they leave a voice message with no way of calling them back and a simple “sorry you missed our call.” Like no I fucking did not miss it. It’s almost like they’re doing this on purpose. I can’t do this anymore. I’m in so much physical and emotional pain all because of this bs, if anything it’s made it harder to find a job. I’ve never spent so much money on basic necessities. Its really really expensive to be poor. I wanna end it already. I don’t deserve this.",2022-11-05 09:38:35,2022,11,5,9,38,35

chili was my first thought, so i think i’ll make that today. but if anyone has any ideas of like one-pot meals (so i can stick it in just one bowl) please comment them below! i want it to be filling, also preferably hot since it’s already chilly outside & gonna get a lot colder. healthy is a bonus but i mean that like high in protein & carbs, not like a salad lol. thanks in advance

Someone who I knew that was homeless recently passed away after having a heart attack in her sleep. She was a very nice older woman, but I don't think she had any family looking out for her from what I understand. Unfortunately, there is an extremely high rate of homelessness in my area and right now the general public opinion is exhausting, anger, frustration, stereotypes, and etc. surrounding the issue - the empathy for the problem has almost entirely run out because of a variety of reasons. That being said, since this woman had almost no family that anyone knew of, the general opinion around homelessness is currently to just sort of look the other way/move on, and most of her friends are either homeless or very near homeless, I'm worried that she will not be given a proper burial or ceremony to honor her life or allow her friends to grieve. I only recently got to meet her a few months ago once I started walking on a road that she would regularly camp out on so I'd try to talk with her/check in on how she was, but I know some people knew her for years and were very close to her.

Does anyone here know of any resources that help cover the costs of funding a funeral for a homeless individual? I'd really like to try to put something together for her or even just a very extremely simple headstone so that she's not just left in some unmarked grave, but I don't know of any places that assist with that type of thing.

What can I do now?, I have no where to go and will not contact my family (most live in Australia, but I did this to get away). I would like to get a job and a place to live, and because I left my family and where I was I would like to finish high-school. But my current focus it staying off the street, or on it for as little time as possible. I do not think I should go to a shelter for youth or homeless shelter, as I have placed myself in this position and there are people that need more support than I do. 
I will stay in the airport as long as possible and will leave by the morning, hopefully by then I have a plan

They record people in vulnerable positions, in most cases berate them for being in the position they are in life, as if they can see the bigger picture of the situation, and then move on in life as if they're doing a good thing. Not only that, but people constantly are able to view the videos of their most vulnerable positions in life. 

I feel like this is sick, and the people who support their channels just don't understand why this isn't good.

yh6ir1,25,iamshamtheman,6,homeless,"Basic Guide (just general could go on forever indefinitely, but ultimately feel free to input and brainstorm). Feel free to DM though. No ego just love helping so keep competitive crap to self. Thank You.","Been homeless for over a year and documenting my journey. Lived successful on the streets alone entire time. Actually in Chicago supporting someone I met on here. She's absolutely experienced most tragic circumstances.

STEP 1: You will need to move to an area that gives you access to resources. No arguments there. Google homeless services, shelters, etc. At least go to establish stuff like an address, various documents you might need, apply to programs like food stamps and Medicaid, place to clean yourself, feed yourself, sleep, etc. There's a government program where you can get free unlimited cellphone service and even a tablet. I went with qlink wireless so Google them.  I don't recommend staying at most shelters unless they're truly supporting your progress instead of vast majority just being a place to exist till death where bad habits and complacency are norm. You'll use this system as long as you need until you're established enough to venture further. I'm in Vegas because southwest weather is more conducive not dealing with rain.

STEP 2: Find a job. There are plenty of options there. Again can use homeless and government resources to help. At least try temp agencies. Apps like Instawork. Amazon is a great place to apply to. Again stay at shelter as long as you feel like best option. You've got your basics covered like place to sleep, food, money, etc.

STEP 3: I only was there for first couple days to establish services I mentioned. Once I got Food Stamps, Medicaid, ID Card then I left because had money to buy stuff to live on my own. For many reasons didn't want to get a place, but stay outdoors. Now you can leave to housing like renting a room in someone's home. Keep working while staying at shelter until have enough income and job stability to leave.

STEP 4: Regardless need to get methods of self defense. I love Amazon. Again can order stuff to shelter or I use Amazon locker locations. Get pepper spray gel. Small version that has a strap around hands. Easy to walk with securely which you should always visibly show. I'd also get a defense/tactical knife with a hilt. Obviously worse case scenario and again when possible visibly display it. Also, avoid walking near anyone suspicious or going to any rough part of town. I don't care how far out of way gotta go. I've been attacked and I'm a former top level athlete who wrestled in college. Unfortunately it's much tougher for women which means way more precautions. Obviously avoid night and unpopulated areas. Try to let someone know location for example I text my buddy places I frequent and in my case place I sleep at.

STEP 5: If you do wanna stay homeless, but on your own like I'm doing, then gotta buy gear and find a ""camping"" spot. I only go to shelter to get regular mail once every week or two weeks. Again used Amazon. You'll need a rucksack first off aka camping/military style backpack. Either can get a blowup camping mat to lay on whatever surface you're gonna sleep on or yoga mat which can roll-up to secure it using lower straps of rucksack. I wrap everything I place unsure using scented waterproof garbage bags.

Inside place shower supplies and anything else that might bust like laundry stuff although I do mine once per week and just buy a single serve at dollar store. In between I spray my clothes down using antibacterial clothing freshener. Use whatever deodorant, sprays, etc to help.

Then I place my clothes on top of that. Then my towels. Inside outside biggest pocket put hygiene products, meds, etc. In one big side compartment put a big thermos for water. In other I put miscellaneous stuff. Stuff like straps, ropes, multipurpose tool, lighter, first aid supplies, etc. Use other compartments as you see fit. For example my very top on one the flap I store my electric shaver kit. Fit in a rechargeable power pack, power cords, devices, etc somewhere too.

I'd get a sleeping bag from Walmart. Better to be safe so I get one at least rated to freezing. I actually sleep in as much clothing as I need. Basically what I wear out in public covered with whatever else I need. For pillow can get inflatable one but I prefer one that rolls up and fluffs up by patting hands around it. One on Amazon by Wise Owl Outfitters. I'll try posting various stuff I got. But basically saying yes get a pillow lol. Roll-up sleeping bag and strap it on using top straps that come down to close top of rucksack which then secures all the contents inside. 

In terms of other stuff I've got a waterproof poncho which covers almost entire body plus big enough to even put over your rucksack. Has a hoody with a lid on it too. I've got a huge waterproof warm bulky jacket that I attach and drap over my rucksack. Figure out best way to attach. It'll cover up your rucksack like a cape lol.

If needed I have a duffle bag that I wear crossbody. Put whatever you think is best. I like putting in gym clothing, food, whatever extra that need more space for, but truthfully more so stuff that won't severely impact me if I lose it. If, for example, you find a great storage spot like for me there's one near where I sleep that's hidden can keep whatever you'd like there like wardrobe, sleeping gear, etc. Keep your duffel bag there when not needed or get something else specifically for storage. Always keep your rucksack with you. Up to you but can outfit it with gps tracker for worse case scenario. I keep an old phone turned on at bottom of bag wrapped up in trash bag. I'll check it every other day and charge as needed. App on my real phone can track it.

STEP 6: Buy public transit pass. Finding a spot. Google Maps satellite view is greatest weapon. Map out places you find essential. I'm near a 24 hour grocery store. Very least can use bathroom. Gym which I not only use to exercise but clean up and even charge stuff. I'd recommend Planet Fitness. Panera Bread is another major place. Go there to chill, charge and do whatever I need. They've got a Sip Club unlimited drinks like coffee, tea, soda, lemonade for only $12/month. Take advantage of free trials though. Libraries are great too. I also look for fairly easy access to work. You'll only go to shelter for mail here and there so not major priority logistically.

I'm at a park. It's actually got a sink on the outside of bathroom structure so always accessable. Near all the spots I told you. So once I find a spot or spots that seem promising I'll ride bus there and do a walk around. I'm behind a bush in the corner against a brick wall barricading park from residential neighborhood. Also a big contributing factor is needs to be safe area. Another factor is how visible you are coming and going. Park I'm at is huge and not very active. Coming back to it at night is easy though because nobody is there. Guess trespassing helps keep them out lol. Luckily the dirt is soft enough and I prefer firmer surface so laying seeking bag directly on ground is perfect. If have hesitation about critters which I personally never had issues with or care too much about can spray area, put traps, whatever else you think is needed. Let somebody trusted know where you area.

STEP 7: Know makes it lonelier, but best to not hang around or associate with other homeless folks. Drug use, mental health, bad habits, getting taken advantage of, even harmed isn't worth risk. You're a target. Vast majority don't want or are able to improve themselves. They've got nothing to lose by dealing with you while you've got everything to. It's tough but obviously lean on online communities like this. Befriend people who are integrated into society. Join social clubs and activities. Personally my first step was get mental health treatment. Take full advantage of free healthcare aka Medicaid. Prioritize health and hygiene. This is about building foundation so no rush or pressure, but everything is dependant upon your ability to feel secure with yourself first. I love studying philosophy like stoicism, listening to audiobooks, creating social media content, etc. Make sure to find social outlets because need at least one person who can at least have conversation with on a deeper level.

STEP 8: Always stay connected to support systems like this group on Reddit. Never forget there are people willing to care and help. Before I got mental health treatment I thought nobody would understand or be embarrassing to mention certain things. Complete opposite. Actually was best thing because being involved with genuine people encourages further positive development. I've been blessed enough to learn from various experiences without fully going crazy haha. Trial and error. So I'm always here to at least suggest because almost guaranteed have knowledge regarding things.

Feel free to reach out and that goes for anyone. If curious can check out my social media by finding links on my profile or DM for anything. Trust me I don't feel there's anything special about me or have any ego. This is about overall help. Just like I've been fortunate enough to receive I'm doing best I can to be there for others. Hope it helps.

Other Resources/Tips: Planet Fitness for hygiene and charging devices, Panera Bread (sign up for Sip Club. Use free trials. Can keep registering as many times via different emails. Once you can't only $12 per month. Good spot to chill and charge devices. Yes, junk but can at least get calories from drinks if needed), libraries and dumpster diving (which I truthfully use for food as needed, but probably best to DM me for details), parks and nature areas, malls, etc. Again, contact me for whatever.

ygxq03,51,veryberryblue,49,homeless,Always reading/hearing about how wonderful the west coast is if your homeless...,"Yeah, not sure if it's even true anymore or what it's like there now but it seems like every time I start reading about the best place to be homeless, it's always Cali, with Washington and Oregon running a close second and third place. Even on Youtube and in forums, everyone is always talking about how great life is out there if your homeless. Is it really true?.

I was out in Cali about 30 years ago and can vouch for the fact that it was pretty decent. The locals were really cool and laid-back, lots of good services and even the cops seemed pretty easy-going and even helpful. For example, I was invited into the home of a disc jockey. I didn't even know the guy but he invited me into his house and turned out to be a really cool guy. Then, I got stopped by a cop and he took me out for coffee and donuts and then, drove me to a homeless shelter which turned out to be a pretty decent one.

I was up in Washington (state) and some older dude (I guess he was lonely or something) invited me to live with him and treated me really well while I was there. I stayed there for about a week and I didn't even know the guy!.

The people/culture out on the west coast also seems much more open-minded, laid-back and friendly but I have no idea what it's like today. I never stayed in downtown LA or anything like that. These were just small-medium sized towns.

I'm almost 2,500 miles from the west coast now so it would be one heck of a journey getting back out that way again but it was a pretty decent experience tbh.

Colorado was pretty good too. I stayed in a really nice, clean shelter. Hardly anyone there. Got clean clothes, a good meal and a bed for the night. Staff were very nice and helpful.

Anyone else here have a good experience out west?. I don't think I'd care for Florida (I've read some pretty bad things about being homeless in that state) and NY sounds like it has a lot of good services but it's way too crowded for me.",2022-10-29 17:05:33,2022,10,29,17,5,33

We believe so, but it’s up to us to make it happen.
How?
Simple ➡️ 
we start by collecting enough signatures so a new tax law is passed which dictates that everyone within a state will give .50 Cents a paycheck. 
And why would we need money? You might ask.
Well, like that we can buy infrastructure or terrains on each state where the homeless can take refugee! Food, clothing, and medical attention.
We as well will be capacitating them to re join the work force by teaching them skills that are highly in demand currently!
And no worries, if they are not suited to re join the work force we will send them to a nursing home! Or facility where they can live comfortably.
We will teach them how to grow food and be self sufficient, while establishing organic markets for everyone! Give the power back to the people! Right!?
Everyone is welcome.
The homeless, runaways, and anyone that needs a safe heaven. 
state by state is how we will start this project and like that we will keep improving it as we grow. 
After it's all set and done we should be all over the USA, we will move to the rest of the world. 
It’s time for us to do a real change, it’s time for us to make a better future while having fun ����
 
Ps; we need all the help we can get. If this tax law can become a reality we will definitely need kind hearted people that really want to help. 
We will need all type of professionals so we can drive the system. 
We are the universe itself, we can do this.
We promise to disclose all information including how money is being used.

I live in a very rural area that has very little to be desired for jobs and work in general. I have been able to pay my rent since April because I had a job at the beginning but they kept draining my hours and eventually I had to leave because they replaced me. I only have enough money for 2 months. My Rent is being jacked up in January And I will not be able to afford it. 

To give a little back story, I live with a family members friend that I hadn't seen since I was a small child. When I was re introduced to her, she told me that rent was $950 a month and that utilities were covered, so we'd both be paying $450 right? Wrong. For 5 months I had paid that, only to get a notice from my roommate stating that the rent was going up, so I had to pay $550 a month. So I was like, ok, I'll try to get the money. But when I saw the official notice it said the current rent was $650 PER MONTH, NOT $950, ANDTHAT THEY WERE RAISING IT TO $750. now, I was kind of irritated, confused, and felt cheated. so, I went to her and what did she tell me? She told me ""oh yeah, that's cause you're paying for utilities"" remember how she told me that I wasn't paying utilities and that they were covered?? Yeah, so either she is only paying $250 for rent, or she's pocketing my Money.

Idk what to do, as the only thing that's remotely affordable is right down the road but it's full up and I'd need to find another roommate.

yg2ro1,46,veryberryblue,60,homeless,Are homeless shelters really that bad?,"If you look up various homeless shelters online, visit thier websites and watch videos about them, a lot of them show clean/modern facilities, smiling staff, testimonials, pictures of happy people enjoying good food, etc.

Supposedly, you just waltz right in, enjoy a good meal, get a shower, new clothes and get assigned a social worker who helps you get free medical care and a full-time place to stay as well as a gazillion other free services.

But then, I read stories from people and all I hear about are fights, drugs, people snoring/coughing all night, crazy people, thefts, mean staff, no beds available, crazy rules, etc. It's really confusing tbh.

Maybe it has a lot to do with which shelter you use, the town/city, the level of funding, the part of the country your in, etc?. Are there any good ones?. Please help me understand.

I am seriously thinking about going to a certain shelter and from the research I've done, they almost sound like a paradise but now, I'm starting to have my doubts )-:

At one time, I did stay in a few shelters and some of them were really nice...like places you might almost want to stay in forever. Maybe all of that has changed now since the pandemic, war, inflation and all the other madness started. To be fair, I've also stayed in some kind of bad ones too. I don't know what to think really.

I should note that some universities have security (typically hands-off and very rarely around during the day anyway) but if you go in and out casually nobody will look twice in your direction. I've only been asked for ID late at night as they don't allow non-students in after around 7 or 8 pm.

After I quit my last job, another boss called me and said he needed a server, and he also offered me a place to stay. How lucky am I! I went there and it was a Japanese restaurant and I loved that place! The space was wide and clean, the staff were very friendly and they took care of me. The boss said to me:"" the more skills you have, the more opportunities await."" He was a nice boss and I was glad to work for him.  He also taught me how to make sushi and how to mix drinks and how to be a bartender. I learned really quick and he complimented me at the end of the day. 

I earned 160 dollars from tips and he gave me 200, and told me to keep working hard. I was so happy today. I went back to my room and took a long shower, now I'm writing this post while smoking cigarettes on the balcony. I realized God didn't give me up and I appreciate it.

ydhqh6,13,veryberryblue,10,homeless,Using a mobile phone while homeless,"I have some questions about using and maintaining a mobile phone while homeless...

How/where do you get your phone charged?. Are there free charging stations?. Maybe public libraries?. Do you just go to a random biz and ask if you can charge your phone there?.

How about a signal if you do not have a current phone plan or the money for one?. Are there free wifi spots and where are they?. Are there apps that you can download that have free wifi spot detectors?.

Where do you keep your phone to keep it safe and from getting stolen?. Do you loan it to strangers if they ask to use it?. Like, some random dude walks up to you, claiming his phone just died and asks to use your phone to make an ""emergency"" call, etc.

And finally, how do you navigate while going from one place to another?. Can you still get paper maps or an atlas for free or cheap or do you need to use GPS and a nav app and if so, what nav apps are the most useful?.

Thanks!.",2022-10-25 16:32:17,2022,10,25,16,32,17

ydbk9z,8,seneeb,12,homeless,What do y'all do for mail?,"So, in March my wife left me with the kids. It's been nasty, I have some mental and physical health issues that I cope with through strict processes, that ex and I could not get on the same page on. That created a very large amount of stress and anxiety in our life together and it (I) just became too much to handle. 

A large part of my issues is that I've never been in a financial situation where I could prioritize my healthcare. So with this divorce, I decided to make my healthcare a priority. After crunching the numbers, I realized I would not be able to do that supporting two households. Hell I couldn't do it being the only income in 1 household. Thankfully, ex decided to move her and the kids back to her parents, so the financial load is less. Anyway, I made a conscious decision to be homeless while I 1: get since of these health issues dealt with, and 2: really figure out wtf I want out of life. 

The next step was figuring out some of the logistics. I'm a large individual (not fat, 6'3"" 260 ish) with a history of back, hip, and knee injuries, so living out of my sonota wasn't appealing. So I made a career change, got my commercial drivers license, and went over the road trucking. First 6 weeks or so were rough as I didn't quite have the capitol up front to equip the truck, but now that's going pretty good (wish I would have waited another week or two before buying a fridge to get a bigger one with a better freezer).

So there's only one logistical thing I'm still trying to figure out, which is postal service. I went to the post office near my companies terminal to get a pobox and they weren't exactly helpful.

I can't help but wonder if he was a female or senior woman if the treatment towards him would be different.

Ironically I was watching an interview with a community social worker (from our city) who said the women's shelters are night and day compared to the men's shelter where there's more compassion, understanding and extension of help towards women whereas in men's shelters there's a lack of resources and supports for them and the expectations for them to simply buckle up and get themselves out of their situations but because of that very lack of supports many men end up stuck and unable to move forward.

As far as I understand, a homeless person needs the following at a bare minimum to be able to get back on their feet:

1. A set of clothes, underwears, towels, toilet paper, wallet, belt, socks, shoes
2. Grooming (Haircut, Shaving, etc.)
3. Hygiene-related items
4. Food
5. Smartphone with a plan
6. Laptop
7. Internet connection
8. Place to live with a kitchen, utensils and other household items
9. Electricity
10. Job
11. Car

I would like to organize this for one or two people. I don't want to do this through a charity or some organization and would like to deal a person directly myself so I can monitor their progress and see what else I can do to turn their life around. I am not rich or anything but I think I can get most of the items listed above for cheap on eBay or something. The only major expense on this list is the car and house, which also I need to figure out for them.

It would be nice if I can help them get a job and they help me cover the expense I initially made for them so I can do the same for the next homeless person but if they can't then it's okay.

Are there any online communities like this where people get together to accomplish this together or am I on my own?",2022-10-23 23:54:49,2022,10,23,23,54,49
yc1c1j,60,XJXJXJP,28,homeless,lost my room in a day,"So in my last post I showed a room that was provided by my employer and I was so happy about it. I went to work for the first day and I worked really hard. I didn't have the experience of being a waiter but I learned fast and the manager said I'm good at it.

And then, as I expected, shit happened. 

The next day the owner of the restaurant told me that he's sorry because he has to fire me. I was shocked because I think I did a good job. The owner said one of his nephews is coming here and he needed a job so he has to take my position. Losing the job also means losing the place to stay so I begged him to give me a few more days so I can find a new job. He agreed to let me stay there for a couple days. Then I called several places and one of the places said they are hiring and they also offers place to stay. I was so happy I found a job in 24 hrs and I agreed. My former boss knew it then told me not to work there because they treat people like shit, but I couldn't wait, I needed money, and I don't wanna cause too much trouble to my former boss, so I still went there.

After seeing the living environment I immediately regretted it. It's a house and there's 10 people living in there and 6 of them are living in the living room with me. I got a bed and that's it, I couldn't even change my clothes without being seen by someone else. The entire house is messy and dirty and there are food, boxes and shoes everywhere. The bathroom is untouchable and full of stains. Even homeless shelter I stayed is better than this.

I started wondering if I really wanna be there. I don't have a choice because winter is coming and I need a place to stay and a job so I can make money. I don't know how long I can stand here. I'm still looking for another job now so I can get out of here as soon as I get my first paycheck.",2022-10-23 21:50:09,2022,10,23,21,50,9

Bill said, “And you?”
I replied, “Me niether”

I asked Bill where he’s from. He told me that he was from Pennsylvania. He began to describe the weather and how the snow looked on the trails near his school. I then asked Bill how he ended up in San Diego. Due to the noise of the passing cars, his story was hard to make out, but this is what I understood: Bill was laid off of his job in Pennsylvania and was told to find work in California. I asked Him how long he’s been here in San Diego. He told me either 15 or 50 years, I couldn’t tell, but I assumed the latter.

There was a short silence, and Bill got up and left.

I wondered how long it’s been since someone asked Bill how his day was. Bill probably doesn’t know, but he was the first to ask about my day in a very long time.

If you live in LA, vote for Kenneth Meija, he's going to do a thorough audit on both where money is going for homelessness and the police.

I am fighting to stay where I am abroad but am most likely going to be evicted and will probably be homeless once I arrive back in the states. In any case, I am preparing for what I think is the worst that could happen to me and/or a very difficult time. 

Because of the coming winter, I changed my mind from Chicago to Atlanta. Two metros where I think there must be good transportation, some decent infrastructure for the homeless, and similarly probable chances for me to find some employment. And the plus with Atlanta – besides having the benefits of a metropolitan area and being in the South so it's probably going to be somewhat warm – is that there are far less homeless people there than in Chicago, which I'm assuming means less competition for resources. Is this a good choice? Is there any detailed, tactical approach to choosing cities?

Also, I'm looking to score a place in a homeless shelter. Would they accept me, a 23-year old, able-bodied male? Or would it be hard to find a place and would I have to stay in the street? (I won't have money so I won't be able to rent an apartment for a while and being in the street is the number one thing I am trying to avoid) When I arrive in Atlanta, should I call 2-1-1, the police, or directly the shelter? Should I call shelters ahead of my arrival to ask about available spots?

Putting all the depression and suicidal thoughts aside, I still had to look for a job. Luckily I got a call from a hotpot restaurant owner and he said he can offer me a job. I told him my current situation and he said he could arrange somewhere for me to stay until I got my paycheck.

This could be the turning point. If things go well I will have a place to stay, and a job.

Luckily I had drunkenly vented to one of my twin sisters when they FINALLY reached out to find out how I was. I cried, I was honest and open about my addiction. I was clear about how it felt to be the last one of 9 and how pretty much everyone has someone within the family. I cried ALOT, I had never been so frank and it was mainly coz they asked. Which let me know it was safe to speak out. 

The twins put money together and got me a 4night stay in a Travelodge with breakfast. These two things happened at the same time, getting the call about the Hostel and my sisters helping me and hearing me out. I was so grateful, I showed my appreciation to both my family and my housing team. Spent the weekend just getting my shit together. Trying to forge some normalcy and spending time with a friend here and there. Taking hot showers and eating substantial food. It had been just over 4 days of sleeping rough and hiding in gyms. Something had finally happened. 

Today, I’m sat in the Hostel, the room is VERY hot, a little boxy but it’s mine for the coming weeks. I have a support team downstairs who are going to help with housing, dental and health and even opticians as I recently lost my glasses on one of my binges. I also asked for help with money advice and ways to improve my credit score. Since I’m a chef, and the hostel is looking for a chef they said I can volunteer while I stay here and cooking is also a past time of mine. 

I’ve also been working on feeling my emotions rather than trying to fight them. Someone stole my wallet from the Hotel I was staying at or maybe I dropped it, it was a gift from a secret admirer who im still don’t know who it is. But it was an LV purse and it had my id and bank cards. I’ve accepted that it maybe gone forever but I’m going to go back to the hotel and see if maybe someone picked it up. That was my first label anything and it’s silly of me to be thinking of materialistic things but I’d hate for the person to show up one day and say “did you get my gift “ and my response is I lost it. 

Anyway, I know I’m VERY lucky, but I guess I wanted to share where I was now. I cleaned up my room and reorganised it as the fengshui of the room wasn’t in flow. I’m going to ask for a little chair for my desk and a mop to further clean my room.

y5z2t7,92,RelativeInspector130,13,homeless,Two years on,"Two years ago today, I became homeless. I was evicted after losing my job due to COVID cutbacks and struggling with depression I could no longer afford to treat. I lost pretty much everything and ended up in a homeless shelter. I had a roof over my head and food, but that was pretty much it. It didn't help that most of the staff had no training in social work. They were hired for their religious beliefs, not because they had experience helping people get back on their feet. They assumed every women there was a heathen, a liar, a thief, an alcoholic, an addict, a threat to society. I got even more depressed. I didn't think I'd ever get out of there.

I ended up staying only 4 months. After I got some rest, I pulled myself together enough to get a good job. Today I'm in my own apartment, with a new (used) car and a new pet. I'm still rebuilding my life and wonder if I'm far enough along with that. And I still struggle with depression, even though I'm back on my meds and have a great counselor.

But at least I'm here instead of on the streets or in a shelter. I'm happy to have a job I enjoy and lets me feel like I'm contributing to society. My apartment is small, but it keeps me safe and sheltered. I'm grateful I was hard-headed enough to not give up. I'm very grateful I have an education that helped me get a high-paying job. 

Two years ago, I was sitting in my former front yard, surrounded by my belongings, wondering what to do and where to go. Today, I'm sitting on my bed, eating Chinese food and listening to music. Things are definitely looking up.",2022-10-16 20:30:56,2022,10,16,20,30,56

I was living with my partner for 5 years then I caught them cheating which lead us to break up. Dispite them doing this I thought things were okay, I tend to forgive people very easily and I could feel us drifting apart for a little bit at this point so I decided to be understanding and forgive them. 

We decided to move out of that place, I was trying to move to the next state once I found a place. One day I came home from work to my ex partner telling me we should go out just one more night to say goodbye. I agreed we were together for five years and had been through so much. They’re the only family I had. They braving me to the border of the state I was planning on moving to, got a hotel and dumped me there with a bag of clothes and some boxes. 

As awful as that was I was luckily able to couch hop for a while to stay warm but my lucks run out and now I’m hopping between fast food restaurants sleeping in the bathrooms most of which I get kicked out from. I’ve been assaulted twice in two different shelters and cannot bring myself to go back. 

Right now I’m applying for jobs, I have a couple interviews lined up, let’s hope I get at least one so I can buy a tent at least.

Yet, L.A. has 65,000 , and Bangkok 5,000 homeless.

There are a few cities in the world that have almost no homeless population whatsoever;

Helsinki, Finland accomplishes this with a ""housing first"" initiative. (so homeless people have a chance to integrade into society by first meeting their basic needs) 

On the other hand, North Korea has accomplished this by making it illegal to purchase food  without showing proof of an address.  (so homeless people just starve to  death)

When I just became homeless, I truly believed things would get better. I tried hard to be optimistic about it, but I still fucked up and lost my last job. Since then it's like I'm jinxed, I got rejected from every job that I applied for, ""we don't hire anymore,"" They say. They knew I'm homeless, I could tell from their looks. 

Now I have nothing, no car, no identity, no shelter would receive me. And it's getting really cold.

I don't think I will survive this winter. 

That's why I'm keeping thinking about just ending my life. I used to try really hard not thinking about it because I wanted to keep my mind positive, so I could keep looking for solutions instead of just giving up. But now, I start to feel like I'm trapped in this paradox of homelessness: I need a job so I could not be homeless anymore, but If I don't have an address, it's impossible for me to get a job or receive any benefits. I couldn't see a way out of this.

I'm thinking about ending it. Maybe it's for the best. People kill themselves everyday and the world keeps spinning. It will continue spinning without me too. Maybe it's better if I end it, maybe there's no winter in the afterlife, no hunger, no shivering in the cold wind, no strange looks, not having to think about where to go next.

Personally I'm 25 days clean off meth, multiple mental hospital stays and 10+ full time jobs aside from the shelter this year.  My coworkers and clients know I'm an addict but think I've been clean for years. I would 100% be homeless and so would my 3 cats if not for my dad and ex constantly keeping me afloat....

That being said I still dont understand what's with the complete lack of empathy in our programs design. I get the idea but it isnt feasible for many clients. Our time limit to stay is two months. How many of you believe that's fair. We have open beds right now and have all summer and fall. The program operates as if people in active addiction, on disability or both can actually pay off their evictions, get a job, recover, find a roomie who isnt shady? In two months, maybe 3...

We have quite a few who've been thru several two month rounds since I've been. Then we have those who've been banned completely for valid reasons but what will happen to them this winter? I get the feeling other staff feel these issues are out of our hands but I dont agree. 

I plan on staying for the long haul, boosting myself up so I can do more for the ones who struggle most. I'm on thin ice for being the staff that breaks rules to do things extra stuff for people who've already used that resource (giving out too many undies to 1 person for example)

y3sgl4,13,Grade_Rare,49,homeless,Drug addict strikes AGAIN!,"Today I woke up at 4 fucking am to my ex yelling ""whose there"" at someone attempting to break into a truck. It was the meth addict who moved into the next encampment over until a prostitute stole all of his things and then he went to Venice. Now he's back? Why the fuck is he on a sideway right behind OUR tent if he needs to pee on grass? He doesn't give a shit about COVID and the police station has public bathrooms down the street anyone can walk into...

&#x200B;

He then also gives two more b.s. reasons: that he's helping an elderly womyn get inside and with groceries. It is 4 AM and every supermarket in the fucking county closes by midnight. The elderly Womyn lives ACROSS THE STREET, and gets PARATRANSIT which pulls up AT HER DOOR (And it's a residential intersection. I'm on a fucking parkway.) facing us but across the street. The stairs down have a railing and she physically can't get up them without falling. The paratransit drivers NEVER help her walk to her door. She doesn't buy groceries, she's not even capable of carrying them, but her family members are asleep by the time she gets home and they sleep like rocks. We can hear her call for help whenever she gets back, which is around midnight. We can also hear her when she is talking to people. Why the fuck would she be at someone else's truck with no one else, on our side of the street with a known homeless drug addict? Explain that one.

&#x200B;

I have so many mental health issues which cause disrupted sleep, and I NEVER fall back asleep after shit like this happens. Meanwhile I need to submit my housing application for a place I really want to get into which opened their disabled housing weight list but it closes today (I have power issues and ADHD) but the sleep deprivation won't help me at all with getting it done, or remembering to get it done, and I still have a gig this morning and the sleep deprivation won't help me with remembering once my gig today is completed.

&#x200B;

I am normally against sweeps, but the activity from my neighbor's encampment is radicalizing me. The main person there brought two druggies over when his situationship person was getting medical treatment in another county. One person was arrested last week and is in jail. The other person is the meth addict who tried to break into the truck, and he kept trying to convince me to take meth ""for weight loss"" 🤮! He only left because a prostitute who was staying at the encampment stole all of his clothes out of his tent. When I tried to give him clothes which were his size which I was given for the purpose of upcycling them, he told me he was in VENICE (Drug mecca for houseless people. One time I ended up being walked to Venice by a weirdo prepandemic because I couldn't get to my storage unit to grab my camping supplies before the gate lockout time so I went to a party at a dungeon which briefly existed in my neighborhood to have somewhere to go and the friend who was letting me stay at their place at times wasn't able to give me a ride to get to them and no one else was that I got stranded and this shady character wouldn't leave me alone when all I wanted to do was walk over to Jack in the Box and just sit there all night for safety... This was the night before I had to go in to be hired by Amazon the first time so I had to keep my clothes nice, and the womyn the guy brought me too called me a ""prissy bitch"" for not wanting to ruin my bottoms which I needed to wear to what might be an interview, and apparently she was waking up to people leaving USED DRUG NEEDLES RIGHT BT HER FACE! The guy wanted to smoke with her and ended up quickly changing attitude and ignoring me after saying they would escort me and make sure nothing happened. I ended up grabbing a Lyft scooter, back when they had the $5 scooter passes for low income people, and scootering to a bus bench in Marina Del Rey in an area I used to work, and laying there in the freezing cold waiting for the first bus I could take back to go into storage for my interview shirt and jacket and to go charge at Starbucks and then get to the hiring location...).

&#x200B;

Days before the prostitute thing, two people who are apparently known for thieving and stealing whatever they can stole my broken mouse poop infested tent from a changeover which I was waiting for LA Sanitation to empty the public trash cans to throw away (The drivers were skipping pickup). I had told everyone else who asked for the tent no because of the sanitation issue and got the one person who actually didn't have a tent in working condition a new tent through a volunteer who distributes tents to people who need it. I ended up getting the people who stole my tent 2 new tents before finding out one of them had housing. So now that they had a tent to use and a tent to sell, they STILL didn't return the old tent until the womyn in a situationship with the main person who camps there told them off (They originally tried to extort my ex for the tent, too. I feel like this is one of those instances where both trying to help people and seeking justice stops or delays them from experiencing karma.), But they filled the tent with LOOSE RAZORBLADES that I got FUCKING INJURED and had to seek medical care!

&#x200B;

Meanwhile the main person who camps there DOES ACTUALLY prostitute/sexually abuse womyn. Apparently one womyn in a yellow dress who isn't all there is being abused by a man who seems to be whoring her out, and she stayed in main person's tent one day. The following day, she spent the ENTIRE DAY tens of feet from the encampment with a cart, just standing around and not doing anything. The ex gave her water, but from what he saw, she was NOT all there. I saw her with the guy a mile down the road days later fighting out in the open. Another womyn had apparently stayed over the previous night. I had seen her before on my way to a dog walking gig earlier that week and she was pretending to do Tai Chi but not doing Tai Chi. I was early so I had to wait a few light cycles and I really needed to drink water, but I got the worst vibes from her. She kept fucking watching me and I had to keep watching her so she wouldn't come up to me. Well apparently the day after she slept with said neighbor in his encampment, she was found in the middle of the rain (Hurricane Kay was at it's closest point to LA, so it rained heavily), and she was just laying there on the ground in the middle of the rain in just shorts and a Tshirt. Apparently she tried going into people's tents including a neighbor just before the problematic encampment and the guy wanted NOTHING TO DO WITH HER (His tent is broken and he doesn't even want to set up the replacement tent because the problem encampment is so problematic, he doesn't want to attract the same attention with the same influx of undesirables or get lumped in there from getting upgraded from what is only a little bit bigger than a Happy Camper tent.), but she was trying because of what he did...

&#x200B;

Every time the situationship womyn leaves temporarily, EVEN FOR A DAY, the main person brings a womyn THE NEXT DAY. One womyn who assaulted her that she has a restraining order against showed up THE DAY after she left. At one point while she was on a medical trip, the main person brought over a womyn for a while who then stole the situationship person's tent and set it up past us to create her own encampment. The main person whose encampment it is I'd a MENACE and THE ENCAMPMENT NEEDS TO GO!

I am also sick of the womyn too. She's an alcoholic and there is a rehab place she can stay at indefinitely in another county. Running water, electricity... But every time she says she is leaving for good, she is back anywhere from days to a week. She practically fake leaves every month. Now because of the meth addicts, it has fucked her up and she acts like she is secondhand affected by meth. I come to find that now she's suffering from high blood pressure and a very high heart rate. Gee, the meth smoke and stress from being there could easily be why... That or diabetes... Meanwhile she acts like she's so attached to this guy who treats her like crap, but he's literally sexually abusing and using womyn. WHO THE FUCK STAYS WITH SOMEONE KEEPING PROSTITUTES OVER? Meanwhile she is having health issues which could easily be from all of the prostitutes... For example, she has an ear infection. My ex used to have chronic ear infections from drooling on the bed. This guy doesn't even clean. One time the womyn bought pizza for the entire encampment, and he opened the pizza box for a slice and LEFT IT OPEN so when she tried to get a slice, there was already a mouse on it! He can't be bothered to clean ANYTHING so she acts like his maid... If he's having strange womyn over, who is to say she didn't get an ear infection off whatever body fluids they got in the bedding? She needs to run away and never come back. I am also tired by how two faced she is. Extremely passive aggressive in group text with advocates, pretends to care about COVID and actively violated all COVID safety protocol when I paid her to help with laundry. She also kept trying to get the meth addicts involved when I told her no that I didn't want to give money to hard drug users. But I am now realizing that drunks count too. I should not be supporting someone as ditzy, flaky, two faced against me, and doesn't even genuinely do the work she is paid to do let alone actually care if I live or die.

She has repeatedly tried to dismiss me as ""but you look healthy"". Bitch, I am just shy of being morbidly obese (I am still metabolically obese and I have been for more than a decade), and I have GENETIC issues and genetically linked chronic health issues that I LITERALLY cannot get vaxxed and am simultaneously high risk for Covid even if I was magically able to get fully vaxxed and boosted. I come from a fucked up genetic line that all of my immediate family members had vaccine reactions and my sister ended up with long COVID where she was CONTINUALLY POSITIVE for 3 months straight less than a year after being vaccinated. She literally couldn't leave her house for 3 months. Her NOT HIGH RISK boyfriend tested negative the entire fucking time while living with her. She is also immunocompromised for a 2/3 out of 1 million genetic condition that is sex linked that there is a 50% chance I have it too and I have had early signs of having as well that there is a good chance I will end up with kidney failure like she has at 35, and possibly liver failure when I don't even drink, it's the genetic disorder.

&#x200B;

At one point the main person kept breaking branches and destroying trees which was fucking up my neighbor's allergies, causing me ex's childhood allergies to come back (They were burning pollen covered pinecones and needles), and we're giving me allergies I NEVER had before! I KNEW when they had fires just by the nose irritation kind of like I know my ex is trying to get away with smoking by smoking outside the tent but I still fucking smell it! When the ex told him no, he physically assaulted the ex. I RECORDED IT, yet the police REFUSED to arrest him and instead spoke my ex out that he thought it was futile and started going along with police which then undermined me when I kept trying to advocate for them to do something!

y3h7j2,82,Crafty-Ad8575,32,homeless,Trial By Fire,"For 7 months I’ve been homeless. I managed to get myself a job 2 weeks into being homeless. At work I busted my ass showing up everyday with no breaks working 10-14 hours and waking up the next day to do it again. Some days I’d go hungry just so I could get something to eat for the next day. I work at a gas station that serves food so I’d wait for stuff to go bad and when my store throws them away I’d come back and take them to eat. Emotionally I wasn’t ok. I found myself crying a lot while eating soiled food knowing I could do better soo much better. This isn’t me. I’d be angry some days and others the depression would get so bad I’d get to the edge of just ending myself. But I knew I was above it all. Don’t take this the wrong way but I view myself as a god. It’s stupid I know but I was bullyed so much when I was younger I developed this annoying god complex that although I know how to tell real from fake it was just what I needed so all those times I started driving really fast so I’d crash and die or when I’d go to the beat and just got deep into the sea hoping I’d drown that thought of being a god kept me alive. I finally stopped being so angry all the time and started to focus. I worked so much I ended up in the hospital a few times my feet swollen so bad and I was in so much pain I couldn’t stand but I decided to give myself a break I changed thinking about what I want to do and what I will do to this:
“Just one more day and if I can’t I’ll give up” days turned into weeks. Just one more day. Weeks turned into months. Just one more day. With all I’ve been though and the emotions and struggles, I don’t feel strong hell I still can’t believe it’s gotten to the point where I can breathe but I’ll say this, if your feeling down, at your breaking point, no one to turn to and your just can’t anymore. Keep struggling for one more day.

Until it's not.

I got fired from the restaurant some days ago because of some bullshit reason. The owner says I'm not working hard enough and I often show up late ( I only showed up late two times in two months and it was not longer than 20mins). So anyway, I'm right back to square one. I have no place to stay because the library called the police one night and they escorted me out of the building. The police said if he see me one more time he will arrest me for trespassing. I don't know if trespassing works for the public library but I don't want trouble. So I'm on the street now, shivering in the darkness and cold wind.

I called all the shelters near me and they all said they don't have vacancies anymore. I have enough money to stay in a motel for two nights but after that I'll have no money at all. I called 211 and they gave me some numbers and I called those numbers and they just kept giving me other numbers of emergency service. None of them actually worked, I feel like a ball that's just being kicked around. 

I'm still looking for a job now. I don't know if I can find it before winter comes. If I couldn't find anything before winter and couldn't find a shelter, god knows what will happen to me.

Starting to lose hope again. I know I shouldn't, but ...

Sleeping in a bus stop now, I hope no one will disturb me.

But what is the most help an individual can do to help the homeless? I’m a young woman living in a big city so I don’t feel safe interacting with strange men on my own, homeless or not, outside of safe spaces which makes this a little harder because otherwise I would give rides.

I hate that people only give the homeless food cause they “don’t want them to spend it on drugs” it seems like equating a homeless person to a stray animal. 

I want to help homeless people in a way that treats them like humans and gives them autonomy so I figure the best way to go about this is to ask people who are homeless and who have been homeless. 

Are bus passes, 24/7 gym memberships, a phone, things like that helpful? I’m trying to think of things that fix the problem of being homeless in the first place, not just treat the side effects of it. What I mean by this is I want to do more than just hand homeless people food and money.

y1o9j1,15,inanotherkey,4,homeless,Looking for feedback on a website design to replace 211 and current resource distribution systems.,"Hello! I have experience in public policy and have some experience being homeless myself. I've had this idea for a while and someone graciously offered to code it up, it's going to be part of the next advocacy project I launch. Please let me know your thoughts. I will use constructive criticisms to change the design before it gets made. It’s one chapter in a draft of a book I wrote up so it might be a little messy. 

TLDR: The website would have a linkable and searchable glossary on definitions of services, a filtered services search engine, optional accounts, and messaging and document sharing for communicating with case managers, for those of you that don’t have phones. 

**Section A: Base set of Definitions.**

When you hear the word ‘supportive living services’ what comes to mind? 

I’ve found many case managers think of a housing program where clients are assigned a case manager and/or a therapist.

Supportive Living Services are actually the customized support someone typically with developmental differences receives in the residence of their choice- which isn’t necessarily a housing program.

For example, a person with autism lives in their own apartment, and a supportive living staff member comes by in the mornings on an as-needed basis to help them get ready for work and plan meals. Services are customized, so when they are doing well they might not use services very often, and when they are not doing well they might need support for a longer portion of the day every day.

When someone is trying to find a service, it’s important that everyone is on the same page about what they’re looking for. 

In some situations, people know what they need, but don’t know what the name of that type of service is. It can be difficult to find what it’s called if you don’t have the words to search it up.

Having a base set of definitions and descriptions of what different services are called can help people seeking services and service providers get on the same page on what a person’s needs are.

It could also help people learn about services that they didn’t know existed, and find services that fit their needs better. 

For example someone might try getting EBT hot meal benefits, but not know that a home delivery meal program exists and they qualify for it.

The base set of definitions needs to be organized by type of service such as food, housing, healthcare, and other categories that would allow people looking for services to find what solution would best fit them. 

A base set of definitions could also be shared with and used by other communities to identify their own community needs and opportunities. 

**Section B: Search Engine**

People would be able to search for services a few ways:

\-They could enter the name of the type of service as seen in the glossary 

\-They could enter their situation by filling out a demographic/intake questionnaire filter and get search results for all services that they may need, or may be available to them.

\-They could search for information about services using filters on the Effective Resource List, seen below. 

\-People could also search for all the services automatically available to them based on statuses such as recipients of SSI/SSDI, EBT, or Calworks. 

Trying to collect data on what communities need can take years and solutions are often far later. The search engine would collect data on what community needs are in real time, so organizations and policy makers can respond quickly. 

For services that are closed to new clients, when people go to exit out of the page a popup could ask people to choose from a few options, including “I need this service, please fund this” and “I’m just browsing” 

**Section C: Effective Resource List**

(This is what the search results would look like. The original draft contains an abridged version of this list as well.)

In this article I’ve described a service design that would replace intakes. The list below is designed for people creating resource lists for their own communities, as a way to help spread the information that matters most. 

1. Program Type 

As defined in the glossary.

1. Program Name
2. Provider

If the organization is really small, it may be the same name. 

1. City/Location

Include all relevant addresses. It is important to differentiate a business office between the location the services are provided. 

1. Hours of operation. 

It’s important to differentiate between the hours the services are open and the hours the office is open. For smaller organizations this may be the same. 

1. A detailed description of what the services are and who provides them

This is relevant when the services offered are a little different than the glossary definition. Saying who the services are offered by is relevant when the services are provided by community partners. This helps anticipate how much support will be or is available, as partner-based services may not be available depending on independent waiting lists, contracts, or legal issues. 

1. Eligibility requirements

These are the requirements people must meet in order to be accepted into the program. \*\*\*It’s important for services to remove eligibility requirements when possible so people can access services preventatively.\*\*\*

1. Cost to participant and/or insurance accepted 

This is an important one to search for on the search engine.

1. Requirements to stay enrolled 

These are the requirements people must meet to not get kicked out of the program. 

1. Waiting list 

This would indicate if there is a waiting list, and the waiting list length time based on the longest amount of time a person will wait before entering the program. If the waiting list's wait time is dependent on individual circumstances, then add a statement that explains who priority enrollment goes to. 

1. What the intake process is. 

Different programs have different intake processes. 

1. Contact information for the intake coordinator. 
2. Contact information for at least one other staff member. 

This is important when contact information changes, employee turnover, and sick leave/vacation time.

1. Funding source

This is relevant for people who are already in other programs, so they know which additional services they can receive without encountering double billing issues. 

1. Contact for filing a grievance. 

This information is listed in the program’s intake paperwork. Most people can’t find this fine print, including a program’s own employees.

1. Accessibility 

Accessibility includes wheelchair accessibility, languages spoken, and proximity to public transportation routes. 

1. Outbreak policies and risk level. 

Depending on what type of program it is, there are higher and lower chances of how transmissible an illness is. This is relevant for general outbreaks and future pandemics, and this information is especially important for immunocompromised people.

1. Date the information was last updated. 

A large amount of information on resource lists is outdated. Having a date can let people expect how many resources will still be relevant. For resourcing organizations, it’s important to update regularly.

**Section D: Accounts**

It would be important for people to be able to make accounts- especially those with frequent, consistent, fluctuating, or higher needs. 

The idea behind this website with an account is that it would consolidate every person’s needs across different sectors and systems within sectors. The search engine would help people find what they qualify for based on their situation and needs, while an account would help those with changing situations and needs update and keep track of what services are available to them and what services they’ve already tried. 

Creating an account would serve multiple purposes: 

1. It would replace program intakes.

A person could enter in all their information, and be able to see what programs they qualify for and what services are available. They would have the option to send their intake form to these organizations. This would replace program intake processes. 

2. It would help coordinate care and communicate with multiple agencies at once. 

There would be a space for people to electronically sign ROI’s, and staff at different organizations would be able to delegate and prioritize responsibilities and needs. Everyone would be able to give and get updates in real time. The account would both be a method of contact, and allow clients to update their methods of contact. They would also have the ability to add notes if the service they were connected to doesn’t work out, so social workers can get a better idea of what services would be more accessible, or the client would feel comfortable reaching out again if their situation changed. 

3. It would help identify needs. 

If they know what service they need, they could enter a service type as seen in definitions. If they aren’t sure and don’t have the bandwidth to find the name of it, they could write a description to give social workers a better idea of what they are looking for.

It’s also important to note what they were originally looking for. If the service they need isn’t available, (unfortunately all too common) they might have to make up for it by combining two or three other services. If case managers don’t know what the goal is, it can look bad on the outside if the client isn’t showing up or accepting services they asked for previously. 

Clients could also identify their needs with a ‘needs checklist’, where they could click on a label for needs they are missing and currently seeking a solution for.

See section E for more details. 

4. It would allow clients to opt in and opt out of services within an organization. 

Services would be based on client/staff relationships that were a good fit. The term ‘good fit’ is common when describing client/therapist relationships, but it also applies to case managers, employment specialists, etc. It’s important to note that when someone is seeking services, they aren’t looking for a person with a standard job title. They are looking for someone who cares enough to do their job well- someone who understands them. 

When clients decide who to see from what program, not only are they gaining agency, but resources are used more effectively- funding and billing would only happen based on the actual amount services are used, and services can be redirected to better meet the need. This is especially important for mental health services that provide medication- we are in a national psychiatrist shortage, and we can’t afford mental health programs that require medication to those not interested when people who both want and need medication are desperate for appointments. 

The website can be set up in a way that is organized by agencies, but used by clients that would incentivize market competition to provide the best services possible. 

There’s been many times when agencies just aren’t providing the services described in the intake. The reasons vary: partners backed out on the contract, ongoing legal settlements, but the most common issue is staff shortages due to low wages and micromanaging bosses. In other words, the exact same issues that every single industry experiences. It begs the question: where is the unused money for these programs going?

5. It would allow clients to see their file.

If clients had the ability to see their file, they would be better able to see and confirm the accuracy of information written on their file. Clients can report whether service providers are providing them services or not.

**Section E. Identifying Needs** 

An account can allow people to identify what they need, and coordinate with multiple social workers. 

An easy way to do this is with Maslow’s Circle of Needs. It’s an alternative to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which was criticized for its hierarchical structure. Different people prioritize their need differently. An example of this is the “starving artist”, whose need for self-actualization is more important than their need for food. 

People could click on a label for needs they are missing and currently seeking a solution for. If they know what they need, they could enter a service type as seen in definitions. If they aren’t sure and don’t have the bandwidth to find the name of it, they could write a description. 

It’s also important to note what they were originally looking for. If the service they need isn’t available, (unfortunately all too common) they might need to make up for it by combining two or three other services. If case managers don’t know what the goal is, it can look bad on the outside if the client isn’t showing up or accepting services they asked for previously. 

(people might have a large amount of needs, but there does need to be goal prioritization) 

The easiest needs checklist can be done with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. People could indicate what needs they are missing and currently seeking a solution for. Someone might have a large amount of needs, but there does need to be goal prioritization

Here is a sample list of needs, based on Maslow’s need hierarchy. I did add and adjust the list to make more sense in the context of services.

Water

Food

Sleep

Toileting 

Medications 

Healthcare 

Air Quality 

Transportation 

Income/Finances 

Employment 

Internet/Technology 

Education

Community/Social Connection

Neither of us have had the means to save and this blows. She can't go to a shelter because of her new jobs. If they found out, she'd get fired. We can't pay for a hotel and I'm at a loss for what to do. I tried to ask my friends if she could at least stay tonight on the couch but they said no. While I understand it just made me devastated.

y0rdxt,1,robslatt4567,5,homeless,Encampment sweeps,"Municipalities like the one in st. Paul and Minneapolis conducted a couple homeless Camp sweeps last week. So there may be more of that before winter sets in. They gave fair warning to the residence weeks and weeks in advance. The city tried to work with homeless people to find substitute housing. However the day finally came and this city show up with bulldozers and Hazmat teams to evict the residents and clean the place up.  This had to be done because the rats and sanitary conditions we're totally unacceptable. 

There is a lot of unrest in Minneapolis right now over this issue. There is a well-known left wing militant group that use this opportunity to pick a fight with local government. It's my belief that this group does not care one bit about the rank-and-file homeless in Minneapolis. They just wanted to pick a fight and see if they could get the government to escalate. This group was so bold they even found the mayor's house and spray-painted evict Frey that's the mayor's name.  That's not homeless advocacy. That's exploiting the homeless to push a political agenda. 

That's my two cents",2022-10-10 15:59:58,2022,10,10,15,59,58

xz3zw7,23,Successful-Career739,9,homeless,Homelessness Update,"So it’s been about 5days or so since being homeless, I am currently on the streets but will likely go to a friends house once they get back from work. When I say I’m on the streets I mean to say I’m utilising my gym membership to lock myself in the changing rooms which have shower facilities and lights that turn off, I’ve managed to get a nap in. My whole body is going to need a deep tissue massage after this last week. 

Recently the topic of Idealism vs Realism has been coming up in my conversations a lot. I embrace my ability to be the idealist that’s always looking at the silver lining. I suppose to some that could come across as arrogant/delusional. Idk, I just feel like everything has always worked out for me, for you and for humanity, otherwise we wouldn’t be in the present that we are in. I am a present being, granted I have fixated on my past ALOT and it’s been to my detriment. It’s just that, I’m the future I get to choose to be in a state of positive expectation. Sometimes it doesn’t work in my favour but as life has intended. Which is still a perfect outcome. 

Come Monday, I will be put in my first pathway/ Temporary Housing. I’m excited, I’m aware it will likely not be much, but I will have my privacy and I’ll get to unpack and unravel. I hope I fucking cry my tears out, I hope I remember how each step of the way has made me feel and allows me to heal in the ways that are clearly coming through this with the cycle I’m in. One thing though, I know my mum would be proud. She raised such a polite and sweet person, it’s been so important to me to remain kind to those that are trying to help me and I’ll be honest, it’s working. 😇 my case worker is from a Neighbouring country to my birth place so she is referring to me as her “little sister” … funny enough this is the kind of love I wanted from my siblings… but life has a funny way of restoring balance. I like to allow people like this to get all up in my heart. 

Anyways, after two weeks my case will be reviewed and I’ll be moved to another space. Some people get their permanent housing after a month (with my case worker especially) so again, positively expecting the best outcome. Whatever that is.",2022-10-08 15:22:32,2022,10,8,15,22,32

xyk99h,10,whoa_seltzer,26,homeless,GAH! I don't have enough money to make any money!!,"Full disclosure, I'm no longer homeless and haven't been for about a year now.  But I was not too long ago.

Before the pandemic I was pretty successful.  However without addiction or mental illness, I still ended up homeless for a year.  Just bad financial decisions in conjunction with the pandemic got me there.

Now I'm not homeless anymore, but I still can't get anywhere close to making anywhere near the money I used to.  I simply never have enough money to wait the 3-8 weeks financial companies take to hire you!  I always have to take shitty jobs that pay way, WAY below my grade, experience and degree simply because crappier jobs hire much faster.  They pay shitty though so it's hard to save especially with this inflation.  Can't save, so I never have the several weeks worth of expenses that it would take for me to wait on a good job.

1- Applied to a private equity firm and two weeks later they called me for an interview.  Then they asked me to come in for a 2nd interview scheduled a week later.  That's 3 weeks of waiting - and that's without getting officially hired which probably would've taken another 1-2 weeks.  By the time the 2nd interview came up I was too hard up for cash and had to apply to a minimum wage place that would hire me the next day.  That better paying job was going to have to wait.

2- Applied to a dream job with killer benefits.  After 2 interviews I was given a tentative job offer... only to have to turn it down because the job required a whole LIST of background checks, fingerprinting etc, that they told me would take at **least** 2 extra weeks to finish!  I couldn't wait anymore than I already had.  Needed money so again I applied to another low paying gig and got the job same day and got my first paycheck only 2 days later.

3- Applied to another financial firm and same story..  Took 3 weeks to go through 3 interviews and I had to take those days off work to do the interviews... They told me they wanted to do a 4th interview with ""the entire team this time"" and I had to pass.... I just couldn't afford taking another day off work.  So back I went to my much too low paying job that I new would give me a quick paycheck.

I have the skills.  I have the experience.   But I can't wait long enough to go through all the interviews and wait to be *possibly* hired.   It's a catch 22.  I don't have the money to be able to wait those things out and the reason I don't have the money is because I have to get fast hiring jobs that don't pay well.... which causes me to not have the money... and round and round I've gone like that for almost a year now.  For almost a year I've been on this never ending shit wheel of not being able to get off these minimum wage-low paying gigs because the higher paying jobs that I'm qualified for don't hire fast enough.

I'm never going to get out of this hole of poverty.  Can't get the job without the money and can't get the money without the job.  IT'S SO FUCKING FRUSTRATING!!",2022-10-07 23:18:14,2022,10,7,23,18,14

I was exhausted after work (physically draining job) and fell asleep. She moved all her shit out, went in my room, stole my bag containing my ID that I just fucking got back, ss card, freshly cashed paycheck, power bank, etc. Luckily I always keep my phone on my person

Rent is exorbitant so I quit it. Was feeling great and adventurous but contracted strep throat a day ago. I think once I recover I will feel great again. It kinda sucks that all I want to do is rest rn, but I am managing. I have all my belongings in a 5x10 storage rental a make frequent trips to it, note: I do not live in it. 

I sleep at a public park. I found a spot where most passerbys don't notice me. A lot of people walk there dogs and sometimes I wake up to a dog running towards me. I don't use a tent, sleeping bag, or blanket. I just lay a waterproof picnic blanket down. And wear layers to keep warm and shield myself from mosquitos. I also started using boot bands around the cuffs of my trousers so I don't get ants in my pants. I learned what times the sprinklers do their thing. (I got soaked while sleeping one time and I think that may be what got me sick)

As for food, I have been getting a lot of hot dogs from 7-Eleven. I even down loaded the 7 Rewards app. I also get Top Ramens from dollar tree and eat them raw as a snack. As for hydration, I carry around a 40oz hydroflask for water. I have a 3gal water jug that I use to refill my hydroflask. Buying drinks is expensive.

I don't penny punch because I'm broke (I'm not) I do it so that I may build savings.

xvzbvt,31,HALabunga,26,homeless,"About to be homeless in Baltimore. I got some camping gear, tell me what you think of my kit. any resources y'all know about in Baltimore?","Ok guys. So I was staying at a place in Baltimore where I was working but that project ended. I had a few hundred bucks, and decided to buy some camping gear and rough it until I get back on my feet. On Thursday I start a job detailing cars. I bought nite cat water proof hammock tent, which can be used as both a waterproof hammock and a small tent. I got a 38 liter interior frame hiking backpack. Wanted a bigger one but this one was only ten bucks. Pocket sized propane stove for 12 bucks from Walmart, 2 1 lb cans of propane. Small canteen kit with mini kettle, pot, plate, and cutlery.  An adapter so I can fill my small propane tanks with a big tank. A hurricane lamp and half gallon of kersone, for a cheap heat source. I have 3 led lights, 2 flashlights and one small flood light. Sleeping bag rated for 35 degrees, needs to be upgraded. 20k mah power source for phone. Tiny little camp stool. 550 Paracord, a hatchet, leather work gloves, hammer Yoga mat as under pad, was all I could find. To move around I have a gravel bike with large saddle bags. 

I have a black card membership to planet fitness, so I can exercise and take showers. 

I'm thinking I need a good coat, right now I just have a jacket, a 20 lb propane tank, and maybe a few gallons of water when I find my ""homebase."" And a couple tarps and some stakes. Eventually a small 10 or 15 watt solar panel. 

I'm not actually from Baltimore. Just came here to get a fresh start. I know I'll be straight with a couple months of work under belt. I don't really have any bills beside cell phone and planet fitness, I should be able to bank quite a bit
 Anyway, in the meantime, what resources does Baltimore have for homeless people? I just applied for food stamps. Anyone know where I can set up camp at? An abandoned house would be the best as far as shelter, but can't I get arrested doing that? I was thinking of setting up a camp on the outskirts of the city somewhere in some wooded area. Where I can stash my stuff in trashbags while I'm working. The hope is if anyone runs across my stuff theyll just see trashbags and not want to mess with it. Any other advice you got for me?

xvribq,5,_alejate,6,homeless,Places to Park Outside of NYC,"Hi, specifically looking anywhere that Metronorth or LIRR goes within an hour or two of NYC.  I've been homeless in NYC shelters and drop in centers for a long time as well as subletting rooms, staying with people I know, sleep on kitchen floor of old job, etc., and considering car living as an option (yes, I know it's cold).  I've been on disability for 8 years due to cancer and started working a remote job two months ago in the hope I could get an apartment but the rents have gone up 40% in the last year and I still can't afford anything, and at this point feel it would be less traumatic to sleep in a car somewhere than to go back to the shelter or continue subletting from horrible people who are just as likely to throw me out when they feel like it, steal my shit for drug money, or all the other things that have happened over the years.  I don't want to stay within the city due to the inevitable parking issues and likelihood of abuse from the police, but I need to stay close to the city since my job requires me to be within an hour and a half of the office and occasionally come in.  Tenative plan is park in Walmart without a ""No Overnight Parking"" sign, bathroom/coffee in McDonalds, shower in a gym, etc.  Just wondering if anyone has any tips about specific towns in LI/NY/CT...I would like to rotate between a couple places so that I don't attract attention being in the same place everyday.

I worked specifically with low/no income seniors. I decided that I can help better doing outreach and helping people navigate the system.

I'm here to help anyone 65 and over who is currently homeless. I can help you apply for the assisted living waiver (ALW) program or for our elderly vets I can help apply for aid and attendance.  Both programs help offset the cost of living in an assisted living community for the elderly. 

For anyone 65 and under I do come across rooms for rent in Los Angeles or Orange County if you are looking a place to live.

I am located in Los Angeles and will be setting up a schedule of where I will be via our IG account which also has my contact information. 

I want to help. If I don't have an answer...I'll do my best to point you in the right direction or connect you to someone.

xpbzvf,0,treyj88,31,homeless,A free ticket to a better life,"Would anybody like to read a story? I’m assuming if you’re here you might be cramped up laying in the back of your car, laying on a bench, sitting outside of a building or in a tent. Hungry. Maybe you’ve escaped this pitfall of life, or maybe you’re just interested in the issue.

I was homeless for a year. An entire year! Now, many people are homeless for longer than that. By in large I would guess that the majority of these people will be terminally homeless. This could be due to a variety of issues. There are those who have genuine health issues; mental cognitive disorders or otherwise that prevent them from ever being able to have a job. There are addicts, and I’ve seen and lived with addiction and I know the difficulties. But at the end, that too is a choice. 

But then there are others who are just lazy. I know this because I’ve seen them. I’ve met them and talked with them. I’ve sat under bridges while it was raining and on benches in the respite of the cool weather Spring brings. Some of these people have nothing wrong with them besides whatever complex they are constructing to rationalize and shift blame off of themselves. That was me too.

For a whole year I felt genuinely hopeless. That despair is something nobody should have to feel. But in the world we live in, you are responsible for yourself. I finally came to this conclusion. And then? I did the unthinkable. I did the thing people here would shun you for! They will tell you it’s a horrible idea! Why? I guess because there’s a preconception of it being difficult, and people are lazy.

I joined the military. Man was it worth it. After a handful of short months of training I was stationed in the place all the homeless dream of coming to. Not only that, I was on perhaps some of the most beautiful real estate in all of Southern California. Not only that, it was FREE! For four years! Not just the housing; the food, clothes, training. All free. In fact, I even got paid for it. 

Now if I go up to just about any homeless person and tell them that they could get PAID to live in housing, with free food, and free job training, they would of course agree. 

But of course not everyone can join the military. Some do have disqualifying medical conditions. Some do have a record. Some may be too old. But for those who can, and wouldn’t, and would instead choose to sleep on the street, shit in a ditch, and shower in a gas station bathroom using the sink. Well, for those people, you’re choosing to be homeless. It’s really that simple. 

I was homeless for a year. After 4 years of being smart with my money and bettering myself as a person, I’m now enrolled at a prestigious university undertaking a paramedic training program slated to find a job in the market paying 6 figures. The military sucked a lot. Nobody who served in any branch will tell you otherwise. But depending on which branch you choose, the suck is minimal and the payoff at the end of it all is life changing. 

I just wish people here would quit dismissing the military or say it’s a bad idea. It changes so many lives for the better(and granted, some for the worse. don’t go into combat arms and you’ll be okay).

Much love and good luck",2022-09-27 03:38:32,2022,9,27,3,38,32

xlgben,5,owiesss,34,homeless,I’m wanting to make some kits for the homeless in my area. What are some good things to include in this kit? Please read the description and thank you all!,"I searched this sub to see if anyone had asked this before and I didn’t have much luck. If I’m breaking any rules I’m unaware of, I apologize ahead of time and I will remove this post. 

A little background:
I just moved to a metropolitan area after being born and raised in a small town states away. My hometown disgust me, as it’s the norm to treat anyone homeless without any sort of respect. I grew up in a family with this mentality as well, and needless to say, I’m thankful I no longer live there and I can now start giving back to those who need it most without getting yelled at by passerby’s and family _just_ for being human. Thankfully, the homeless population in my home town is small to begin with, and it seems people are breaking this mentality as we speak. 

I’m wanting to put together a kit as I’ve mentioned, and here’s what I’m thinking to include in it. I wanted to drop in here and ask for some feedback, in case any of the items I have in mind aren’t actually practical and could be replaced with someone more practical. Here goes:

• A small bag or backpack to store all items in the kit

• Snack packs and other non-perishable foods, such as ramen, cracker and tuna packs, granola bars, etc.

• Unscented deodorant, tooth paste & toothbrush

• Warm socks and gloves, and hopefully some liner socks and gloves too (We live in snowy conditions)

• Emergency warming blanket and/or warm poncho 

• refillable water bottle 

• Wet wipes and/or bathing wipes 

• pen and note pad

• laminated list of resources in the area with numbers and addresses 

There may have been a few things I’ve left out, but these are the main items I’m working on getting in bulk at the moment. If anyone has any items that you think I should add to the kits, I’ll be more than happy to follow through with any suggestions. 

It might be a few months before I am able to start putting these kits together as I’m a recent grad who is still searching for employment in my new city. Many people, such as my parents back in my hometown, are not in favor of my partner and I doing this, their main reason being that we are young adults just getting started in our careers and we need to think of ourselves and only ourselves. This has made it just a tad harder to get started on, but there’s no way I’d let the outdated mentality of my parents stop me from helping those who happen to be in a homeless situation. Screw that mentality. We are all humans deserving of basic necessities, and that’s exactly why I want to do this. The resources in my new city are pretty decent, but they can’t reach everyone. Not that I will be able to reach everyone either, but something is just calling me to be _that_ person. I hope I’ve made some sense with my background and why I’ve chose to help out. Another thing that somewhat disgust me is seeing people helping out someone who is in a homeless situation, just for internet points. My phone most likely won’t be anywhere near me when I’m able to start giving the kits. It is possible to help someone out simply because they need it, and not for personal gain or internet points. That is something I’ve learned since moving to a city that cares about all their residence, whether they have a house or not. 

Any suggestions for the items in the kits or how to go about distributing them is very much appreciated!!

Thanks everyone for taking the time to read my post, may every one of you have an amazing day. ❤️",2022-09-22 17:03:50,2022,9,22,17,3,50

xfu09n,88,ScarPhace_,15,homeless,Currently homeless and my experience and thought as a Black 22m,"I just been recently kicked out the my ex friends place due to getting into a fight cuz he was off drugs and demanding money for 2k (the game).

This isn’t my first time being homeless, when i was 18 i was kicked out the house for a month  by my grandparents so that can teach me a lesson, knowing i was homeless before moving in with them after taking me in off the streets when i was 15 homeless living with my family (1 sibling and 2 dogs). 

Being homeless through out my life has taught me a lot and also traumatized me affecting me mentally and socially.
Prime example was when i was 7th-9th grade i was living in a single bed weekly motel room with 4 people, accompanied by a million roaches. i was afraid to be seen where i was staying at so i was alone with no friends other than my younger brother

Currently i’ve been homeless for the past 3 wks now , i do work and get paid weekly but i came to the conclusion is it’s hard to save when u have nothing. so i sacrifice spending money on hotels .i don’t have a license or car so i don’t have the benefit of sleeping in a car but i will eventually. When i’m not at work i try to find a place with wi-fi to save data and entertainment. what helped me was the local library. i work graveyard shifts so i can be up at night so by the morning when i get off i can chill at the library

As for sleeping arrangements, i don’t have anything really my first two wks was me sleeping on the bathroom floor of a gym in my ex apartment complex. Until i got confronted by one of the maintenance people staring people complained that i was chilling at the apt complex bench for to long and it scared them. But as of last night i slept near a gated dumpster with no shame. i cover myself head to toe to protect me from mosquitoes.

Though times are hard, but ik if i put in pain and buss my ass that i’ll be able to afford my own place with a roommate atleast. Some how i don’t feel really depressed about it. surprisingly i have some kind of inner peace. I try to stay positive because i hate to be a downer and make people feel sorry for me.

The housing market is absolutely shit rn. Apartments and houses costing more than a brand for a single bedroom.

I make 1.2k a month or about 1.4k depends on the hours I receive.

I had just received surgery a while ago and I'm in medical debt as well.

I called shelters and multiple apartment owners. They're all on waiting lists and at full capacity. Even affordable income based apartments are also at full capacity and aren't available. I live in Florida and a lot of other apartments or housing is only available for seniors over the age of 55. I've been denied because of low income even though they have scammed me out of application fees and other shit which doesn't make sense to me how someone can have low income to the extent where they can't afford housing but they're able to afford stupid application fees that are non refundable if you're denied. 

Anyways I would get a second job but I struggle with transportation. I've been assaulted on the bus before I don't do well with that. I try to walk everywhere but the weather in Florida and just the climate on earth in general has gotten ridiculously bad and too hot. I would have been able to walk to work for an hour like 4 years ago but I can't do that anymore.

 Contrary to popular belief,  most homeless people I have known are not addicts, with the exception of a homebum, I seen more drug use and addiction amongst rich affluent folks then homeless, the only reason why drug addiction is stereotyped with homeless is because homeless folks have no walls to hide behind,  most rigs you find on the ground in major cities are from rich folks,  and of course, homeless get blamed....",2022-09-08 09:53:50,2022,9,8,9,53,50
x9hhkb,4,Confident-Manager-11,8,homeless,Gentrification and the Homeless,"Gentrification is a good thing only if a city has spare housing and here's why... 

There will always be poor people and misfits and they need and deserve a place to live too. For example; When a city condemns an old rundown seedy, drug and crime-infested hotel every person in that hotel becomes homeless. Every city needs a seedy part of town for the poor and misfits to live in. If you clean up your seedy part of town as every city in Calif and other states are doing you will have an explosion of homeless and having developers set aside for affordable housing don't work for they don't want to live with you in your neighborhood they would rather be among themselves but not in a tent city next to a creek. I have watched Calif slowly do this over the past 35- 40 years and now enough of you have moved to Nevada where you are doing the exact same thing... Pointing out one hotel after another calling them crime and drug infested and saying something needs to be done about this... NO! nothing needs to be done about this there will always be a percentage of the population like this and they need and deserve a place to live too. You are not going to change human behavior by taking their homes away. Sacramento went so far as to outlaw people living in hotels or Single Room Occupancy (SRO) as they call them. How's that for compassion? And every person in the 1,000's hotel rooms they condemned and tore down moved into a tent down by the river where they are to this day. 

You know, the leaders of cities like SF and Sac have excellent Ivy League speech writers whose words overflow with compassion but ring hollow in action.

I am AFAB, pre EVERYTHING. 24/7 camping is in effect. I have ADHD and I am fasting so my sugar is low.

Today I went into storage to declutter because I am a hoarder and I haven't been able to do a clean out since late 2019 due to problems with the building managers, being high risk for Covid.  My solar powered light die so I went to slip it in the front window panel of my tent (The lights at my storage facility turn off every 15 minutes. I also have astigmatism and am legally blind. I need the light.).

We'll, when I turned around I realized the back window was halfway open because I was overheated from all the effort this morning. Someone biked by on a scooter. I panicked, so it took more than a second of them staring for me to cover myself.


I am so ashamed. For one, me being visibly topless as an AFAB makes me seem like the crazy person when I am already camping with the ex and experiencing DV. He gaslights and deadnames me constantly. He was part of the reason why I couldn't transition at all while I was housed.

No one is going to take me seriously if they're seeing what are basically D sized boobs because I gained about FIFTY FUCKING POUNDS during the pandemic (This is why I am trying to fast 3 to 5 days a week. I am scared that even if I lose all 50 lbs, the boob weight won't go away or I will still have loose skin and still look like I have boobs. I have been wishing if I could get down to 12% body fat, I won't have boobs anymore.). Cis men don't cover themselves when people stare.

This group is more shrouded in secrecy but (I hate to sound like a broken record but I personally seen “guests” at GEO Re-Entry Services sporting the gear and referencing them frequently so it was a huge tip off…)

This group more than others is active in the urban community. Which I see as extremely detrimental to the minorities in San Francisco. One huge indicator that they’re police is the gun buy back they do with SFPD. Most of these dudes claim to be ex-cons yet they’re handling firearms (which even a bullet can get you a 10 year violation) with the gosh dang police.

I mean its obvious shit like the gun buy back that makes me feel like Morpheus & I’m the one of the few people on earth whose unplugged from the Matrix.

[Western Addition Career Center on Fillmore in San Francisco](https://bit.ly/3cnNytc) is an advertised “community outreach & job center” but it does staff individuals from United Playaz. After speaking with the fellow there I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt yet even after saying I was on federal probation he tried to upsell me on taking a job in the cannabis industry. I can’t begin to tell you how potentially detrimental that is to a person on federal probation. No matter how you feel about jazz cabbage the fact of the matter is its still federally illegal and (if you’re on federal paper) could potentially end with you getting a new charge.

United Playaz keeps a pretty low profile but if you end up caught in THEIR web your goose is pretty much cooked.

\[Single Room Occupancies\]

A question that you may be asking yourself is “OK crazy man if everyone in San Francisco is a cop where are they all staying huh? Easy, enter SRO!

What these places allegedly are is renovated cheap hotels converted into long term living. Basically a permanent hotel room. To further help cover things they’re given press such as “programs to assist the homeless”, “sober living facilities” or “post incarceration services”.

But as a person whose A. homeless B. recently released & C. an alleged former drug user I’ll tell you now there was no openings anywhere for me. Even the ones, where they said 6 to 8 month waiting period to get accepted, haven’t contacted me. Even after the “waiting period” has came and went. Yet the alleged drug addict bent over at the waist all day suddenly disappears every night to some form of lodging every night.

\[Code Tenderloin\]

This location is literally across the street from GEO Re-Entry Services. It’s primarily a training center geared towards anything tech related. Honestly I don’t have much info past that since I never went. Even before I knew what I know now I had a bad feeling about Code Tenderloin. It didn’t help that Stanley Williams Senior kept trying to upsell me on heading over there.

\[Norma Hotel\]

This was presented to me as a spot I would be able to succeed. But very quickly it turned into yet another Hell On Earth. From the beginning I let the case manager (Daisy Gonzalez) know of the abuses & harassment I suffered through at GEO Re-Entry Services. After a 5 minute or so recap of 111 Taylor Street (GEO Re-Entry Services) Daisy Gonzalez shakes her head like she understands reassures me that The Norma Hotel is much different then immediately puts me into a room with Rooz(beh) a dude who was in a room quite literally across the hall from mine at GEO Re-Entry Services.

Rooz(beh) is a dude I would catch following me around GEO Re-Entry Services & later on the street.

*Rooz(beh) isn’t hard to miss but at least around me he never said very much. He just kind of slithers to & fro looking for his next bust. He’s about 5’7 or so with a bad case of male pattern baldness.*

This location is not hard to miss as it's about a block or so from 24th Street BART. However they have cameras outside of the location *but it's full of la juda* (the police).

Avoid! Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!

I can’t stress enough how much you should avoid The Tenderloin. On the surface it appears to be the centralized hub of vice & debauchery in San Francisco. To a certain extent that may be true.

*Cop, officer, gendarme, peeler, fuzz, Five-O, Po-Po, One Time, 12, The Man*. Whatever you want to call them, they're out in San Francisco in all different forms, shapes and sizes.

After the 2 and a half years I’ve spent in San Francisco I’ve had the unfortunate experience of getting caught in the web that is San Francisco policing. This section is entirely dedicated to the location that I know of where police congregate, fronts & businesses that aren’t what they seem, also useful tips to avoid being harassed or targeted by these individuals.

*This is in no way, shape, or form a guide to assist anyone in breaking the law. This is however a guide to not have the law abuse its power at your expense.*

If you know of The Tenderloin then the mental picture that comes to mind is not a pleasant one. How is it the rest of the city is so much more nice & crime free. But The Tenderlion is such an absolute mess? Knowing what I know now, & you will also by the end of this section, it's most likely by design.

\[[GEO Re-Entry Services](https://thecountofmontecrypto.blogspot.com/search/label/Part%201)\]

I could spend a lot of time on this one topic & quite honestly I have on the blog I started.

For me this location is the central hub. Babylon. Mordor.

After spending 530 cumulative days at this location I can tell you with all certainty that this is the starting point for a good majority of all the narcs in San Francisco. After completion of this program they’re spread all over The City. 95% of the people who go into [111 Taylor Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/111+taylor+street/@37.7835368,-122.4108501,3a,75y,226.01h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sC2_GO2suh6JNN30WHhKq_g!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x808580856918e095:0xd4b911156b25e0e9?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiGi_mE1-D5AhVqLUQIHUMADOQQxB16BAgMEAI) are police. A lot of the residents claim to be ex-cons but the fact of the matter is the vast majority have never had a parking ticket before let alone a state or federal conviction.

I've seen that a lot of people had rallied around this fellow named Malik Washington out in San Francisco. (Davis Vanguard, San Francisco Examiner which in the 1800s was a secessionist newspaper *ever wonder why its free?,* 48 Hills, San Francisco Independent Journal, KPFA Radio, Courthouse News Service, Indybay, Prison Radio) I was given ""halfway house"" time at GEO Re-Entry Services in San Francisco being that I was originally sentenced out of the Northern District of California and was eventually returned back to SF when my prison term was close to ending. Now I was at GEO Re-Entry Services for a cumulative amount of 530 days and during that time I never saw nor heard of Malik Washington once! EVER! All that baloney about him being there etc. was just that baloney! I saw that the San Francisco Bay View Newspaper posted an article alluding to him being a ""rockstar informant"" again this is unequivocally false! For Malik Washington to be an informant to begin with he would have had to have been a criminal. He's not! The story in SF Bay View is a huge crock. Malik Washington and what I now believe SF Bay View are cops period point blank. The newspaper is being used as a propaganda driving tool for this area and most likely other areas.

Also whenever I was at GEO Re-Entry Services during my 1st visit there was an individual there by the name of Dan Rush. He had [a full feature in the San Francisco Chronicle](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2020/bay-area-union-boss-legalize-pot/) that the guests in GEO Re-Entry Services kept talking about when I was there. Now I met the man personally and on top of being a huge racist he is also an undercover. The oddest part about a lot of the news outlets here in San Francisco is how much propaganda they’re willing to perpetuate to the citizens of this city.

At the 111 Taylor Street GEO Re-Entry Services location the residents are placed in jobs out in the community. Civic Pit Stop is one of the more popular choices. I guess to start off you need to police the toilets of San Francisco before you can walk a beat.

A prerequisite to work at Civic Pit Stop is getting clearance from The Department of Homeland Security.

It seems like the people who work at Civic Pit Stop are over qualified to guard toilets. That is unless…

Norman Oklahoma is trying, other areas are trying if I hang on, hang on and keep upbeat I'm ok. If I keep my care plan meds solid that's all I need. My body is falling apart from another round of Covid. I can't keep my mind well when p.a.c.t. is dragging their feet. 

What do I do? I need to be out the door to pick up emergency housing voucher at their office. But I have Covid again and it's like mom's cancer and dad's stroke all of 2009into 2020 were endless immune system concerns. I'm afraid to pick up the voucher sick with ten masks. This round was more exhausting than the rest. I called my doctor and they said they ordering a liquid to try for cough. No pneumonia. Just Covid.",2022-08-23 13:47:25,2022,8,23,13,47,25

wuftzo,136,Moongadoonga,21,homeless,Never Get Comfortable.,"It may seem harsh. It may seem crazy, but please please never get comfortable when you're at someone's house. Whether it's a friend, a family member, or a spouses place.

You will gain expectations. You will gain expectations that these people actually care about you. I've learned the hard way. I've learned that the only person who could ever care about you is yourself.

If someone gives you a few nights to spend at their place, don't get comfortable. Don't sleep in, Don't feel welcome. Your only purpose there is to have a place to sleep. Get up and get out there. Go to work. Even if you don't have a job, just get out of their way up until it's time for you to lay your head again.

To all those like me dealing with homelessness, I love you. Stay safe. Be safe.",2022-08-21 19:10:45,2022,8,21,19,10,45

wnq8d4,13,throwitawaybongybong,7,homeless,Might: Run for some office in town.,"I experienced six months of homelessness roughly three or four years ago.

I've been out there. I slept in my tiny car, which I was incredibly thankful to have until I totalled it right after landing a bed at a group home, under the hospital floodlights to avoid getting attacked. ""Slept"" is a bit of an exaggeration. It was cold. It was winter. I'd wake up with my toes freezing, then turn on the engine for a moment to warm up real quick.

Luckily, the car was efficient on gas. Unfortunately, I'd burned a lot of bridges with my family, so I had little help on the way.

I got a food stamps card within the first couple days. Thankfully, they expedited mine. I mainly subsisted on the $1 loaves of Walmart bread (gimme that everything bread, baby), whatever I could just peel and eat, and the $1 ten piece nuggets from Burger King, which are no longer only $1.

Running for office or something, the plan is to put my name and ""FOR [OFFICE]"" on crumpled cardboard signs in permanent marker block letters because I will advocate for the rights of homeless people who need housing, healthcare, childcare, employment rehabilitation, and other things.

We're going for full coverage around town.

I do not have a car 

I will bus it everywhere.

Thank you for listening to my Ted Talk.

she's still in surgery, but here's the outcome so far

-right hip is shattered
-bottom vertebrae is crushed
-left leg the calf and ankle are broken; knee shattered
-right leg solid break to her thigh bone
-right shoulder is shattered
-left arm is dislocated
-heavy gash on forehead
-possible brain trauma

I've talked to the police and investigators. as it stands the woman who hit her was driving approximately 65/mph in a 45/mph zone. they are charging her w a felony hit and run. she ABSOLUTELY hit her head on and according to witnesses she flew right over the car and landed behind the guard rail. the woman didn't even bother to stop or anything. if i see that bitch, I'll kill her w my bare hands and use my last bit of oxygen doing it. 

when i showed up to the hospital they still haven't found her. apparently the person who was driving beside her (it's a 4 lane roadway) got behind her and was able to get half her tag info and car type when she called the cops. they haven't told me who the person was yet, but they are trying to locate her. 

now i wait. and I'm praying. and bartering w God. if you hafta take one off us, I'll gladly take her spot. I've lived a pretty good life. I'm still asking for prayer donations and positive vibes. i know we're all strangers here, but i firmly believe in the power of positive thoughts!

and to the person who accused me of being shitty and making a post for *money* i hope you NEVER have to go through this. either the comment got deleted or something, but i still got the notification in my email. i hope you know how disgusting YOU are making it sound like i would make up this entire Ludacris story to get a few fucking dollars. you're the gross one for even thinking a MOTHER would even concoct that for money.

Today I feel better. The work doesn't feel that overwhelmed anymore. I just put on my headphone and just start washing dishes and mobbing the floor, preparing ingredients for the cook. Afternoon I can have some break and smoke a cigarette then start work again. 

The day ends really fast when you try not to feel.

Before I realize anything I'm on the bus. I looked around and everybody looks tired, I could see it from their back views. There were full bus of people yet it's dead silent in there. Only thing I can hear is the roaring of the engine, even the engine sounds like it needs a break. Everyone is looking at different directions so that no one would have to look at each other.

Everyone is looking at different directions, even though they are feeling the same kind of pain. The pain of surviving in this cruel world, the world that winner wins all and the others get swallowed and threw into the darkness.

And I'm trying to climb out of this darkness. Only God knows how long it takes to climb out. 

But I have to, because the life goes on whether I like it or not.

Listings for different resources are listed here and in the comment section concerning food, clothing, housing, telecommunications, medical insurance and meds, finance, instructional YouTube videos, sexual health services, and more. This guide has been updated as of Sept. 2022. By clicking on my username you can see what I have written for others. Call your local county social services office ([https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services](https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services)) as soon as possible. United Way's 2-1-1 phone number can give listings for different assistance services in your area. Some local cities may have  municipality level housing services, but you will have to check the local city government website. Out of food, shelter, and clothing housing is always the most difficult to secure. Once you are on one assistance program, such as Medicaid, then it is much easier to get help from other assistance programs.

Eviction prevention might get you some help for one or two months. Next, look at temp agencies for a job. Quick signup for jobs can be found at [bluecrewjobs.com](https://bluecrewjobs.com), [instawork.com](https://instawork.com), and [coolworks.com](https://coolworks.com) (national park jobs with some listings having housing as a benefit). Some large temp agencies are People Ready ([peopleready.com](https://peopleready.com)), Labor Ready ([laborready.com](https://laborready.com)), Adecco ([adeccousa.com](https://adeccousa.com)), and Labor Finders ([laborfinders.com](https://laborfinders.com)). Other temp agency names can be found at [https://www.thesmbguide.com/staffing-agencies](https://www.thesmbguide.com/staffing-agencies). You can get quick acceptance to do warehouse work by signing up with a temp agency and showing up at a shift. Some temp agencies have a bus to take workers to a work site. Some shifts start at 4 or 5 am. Those who get to a temp agency first in a day are the most likely to get a paid shift regardless of time of day to pick from. You can also work at Walmart if you do not have permanent address. You can find job training opportunities via state workforce departments. Departments by State are found at [https://www.naswa.org/membership/workforce-agencies](https://www.naswa.org/membership/workforce-agencies). Apprenticeships may also be found at [https://www.apprenticeship.gov/](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/).

The most important immediate actions to do today are to have your government ID, a SSN card ([https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/)), an official birth certificate ([https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm)), and any passport in your possession. You can go  to a local bank and rent a safety deposit box to keep some of those things secured from theft. In case you are without a permanent address you can get General Delivery from the U.S. Post Office with information at [https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-is-General-Delivery). Ask the local postmaster at a readily accessible post office near you that you think you will frequently use. Locations are at [https://tools.usps.com/find-location.htm](https://tools.usps.com/find-location.htm). Having General Delivery will be how you get government documents, like medical insurance and SNAP cards, from assistance programs if you are without an address or shelter. You can also use that post office's address on your government ID as a mailing address and job applications.

Immediate cash can be found at a blood plasma donation business. Usual compensation is $30-45 and takes two or three hours. The following are three major companies across the U.S.:

Fax resources can help apply to assistance programs or financial institutions from anywhere. A fax is considered equal to mailing a physical document under U.S. federal law. Websites for sending faxes are [faxzero.com](https://faxzero.com) and [gotfreefax.com](https://gotfreefax.com). There are limits to how many free faxes are sent a day. Fax Zero allows up to five faxes at three pages per day. Got Free Fax is up to two faxes with three pages each. The app called Adobe Fill & Sign is available for Android or Apple phone devices. It is a useful app where forms can be filled in saved as a PDF file. This PDF file can then be sent as a fax via the referenced websites. App is at [https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/fill-sign-pdfs.html](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/fill-sign-pdfs.html).

Public libraries are great resources to help with applying for jobs and assistance programs via public wi-fi, publicly accessible computers and databases, making paper copies and sending faxes, and hosting of classes and programs. Listings for all public libraries across the U.S. is at [https://librarytechnology.org/libraries/uspublic/](https://librarytechnology.org/libraries/uspublic/).

While there's always been a mix of types, there used to be a whole bunch of my brothers and sisters who have been at this for a long long time like me. Just in the past couple of years, it seems many if not all of them have disappeared - or at least have stopped posting and commenting. I stopped in March of last year. I am tempted to create a  long-term homeless sub because 99% of stuff on here  is now like - What's it like to be homeless, I'm about to be homeless, it is my first night/week/month of being homeless. Nothing wrong with that but when you've been out there for over a decade, it is nice to know there are others who know what that does to someone.

I can tell you that the longer you are homeless, it is like going further and furhter out into space - away from everyone else. It changes the way you look at everything, everyone, and every aspect of society. My biggest piece of advice to newly homeless is to trust nobody. At first, it was hard being alone all of the time. It is amazing what you can get used to. And one thing I've gotten used to is that things always only get worse. The older you get, the more difficult everything is and the more cynical and miserable you will become.

On my local sub, the majority of the discussion now is about how nobody can afford their rent increases and how having any place to live is becoming only for rich people. These same people are the ones who spent the last decade complaining about panhandlers and homeless camps. Funny how life events can change your perspective.

wb3oep,1,significant-coder,0,homeless,Homeless Youth NYC,"There are about 101,000 students who have lived in unstable or temporary housing for just the school year of 2020-2021, according to an analysis done by Advocates for Children. The number is only increasing with each passing day, and there is very little support to assist these young individuals.

I would like to propose an idea that could potentially help reduce the instances of homeless youth. By intervening and providing support systems for children at an early age, we would be able to identify at-risk students who could potentially become homeless. To be more specific, these include community programs, children support centers, in-school outreach events, and more. I believe that learning about how to become financially self-sufficient is important for youths, especially those who are at risk of becoming homeless. By providing more opportunities to learn about how to become financially self-sufficient in school and held events, young children would be inspired and reduce the rate of homelessness of youth.

There are many opportunities already that assist youth homelessness and one great resource is [www.TechieYouth.org](https://www.techieyouth.org/) which provides valuable knowledge to foster kids and other vulnerable youth. Techie Youth teaches how to be financially self-sufficient and much more information that is important to know as an adult.",2022-07-29 06:35:33,2022,7,29,6,35,33

I left the library today, I don't know what happened today but I saw some cops standing there and I don't wanna be in trouble. I walked for an hour and found a McDonald's. 

I've ordered a small fries and a small cup of drink and I'm writing my diary here. But I'm gonna leave here in a while cuz this place doesn't look safe to me. There are some men on the parking lot and there were loud music playing. They've been staring at me when I went in. There's a shelter near by but they don't have wifi, guess I'm gonna sleep there for tonight.

I took a nap this noon while in the library. I dreamed about my family, I was still a kid and we were eating dinner together and my dad asked me how I was in school. I told him there's nothing to worry about.

When I woke up, there were tears in my face. I don't know was it because I just woke up, or because of the sadness. I miss having a family and being taken care of. I miss when there's people who think of me. But that is not gonna happen again. I will be alone for a very, very long time, and it's gonna be hard. My only wish is to stay sane while I'm alone. 

God, please help me get through this. I might not be a good believer but right now, you are all I got.

Nothing else happened today. Still very hot, hope tomorrow will be better bc tomorrow is raining.

This also means my plan of laundry and shower is cancelled. I'll do them tomorrow.

The library was dead silent. I was sitting on the floor of a corner all day and I couldn't even sleep. Depression started to attack me and I began to picture myself in a prison, only by my own will. There was no food, but I had plenty of water. 

I started to think about what I'm gonna do with my life. It looks like I've hit the rock bottom, and there seems to have no exit. I'm stuck here in life like I'm stuck here in the library: I won't die, but I'm also not living. What do I want with my life? I don't know. If surviving is my entire purpose, dying seems like more of a easy way out. 

Nah, who am I kidding? I'm not gonna kill myself, I still have no balls to do it. Maybe it means I haven't truly hit the real rock bottom yet? I don't know. Only thing I know I must not keep thinking about it, because if I thinking I might actually do it. 

There's literally nothing else going on. Just me and my stupid depressed thoughts. I'm sure there'll be a lot of days like this. Fucking loneliness...

I have been in psychotherapy and trialled every relevant medication under the sun for over a decade, with more clinicians than I could count on both hands. The consensus has now become that I don't have more to gain from therapy or meds at this stage but I do still live with the trauma of family violence, and have never been able to shake the discomfort with living in 'indoors'. That would include any homeless shelter.

I spent my free time roaming and resting outdoors. I feel so much safer then. 

I think I can't taked homed life anymore. I fear other homeless persons and the general public and people I know would hate on me saying I'm voluntarily homeless or homeless by choice rather than understand the mental health challenge, because I have been able acquire and hoard money and maintain housing. I can feel the hate already from people who don't want to be homeless, but I ask you, empathise with the pain of having anything but homelessness be a greater suffering.

I have snuck into a slept in outdoor toilets, done car camping (feels too indoors) and regular camping (illegal in urban environments in my country which is no good for access to services). They aren't cutting it for me.

Today my friend's landlord found me sleeping in his couch. He said I'm trespassing and tell me to move out before night or he will call the cops. I don't wanna trouble my friend so I moved out at noon. I'm back on the street now. 

It's really, really hot today, almost 100 degree. Me and the buyer of my laptop agreed to meet at the Starbucks, which is almost 3 miles away and there is no bus that go there. I walked the whole way. During the journey I thought a million times of how I should just kill myself and end the suffering. Everytime I saw a truck passed by, I had an urge to jump in front of it. 

But I didn't. I couldn't do it. I said to myself ""what if something happens to the truck driver? He could be having a happy life with his family. Is it fair to hurt some else just to kill yourself?"" Then I laughed. Because all that was just excuse.

The truth is I'm just a coward. I didn't do it because I couldn't do it. I don't have the balls to do it.

It's a strange world, it's too hard to live, but it's also too hard to die. There are people choosing each side every day, but I'm kinda stuck in the middle. Then I suddenly realized that for homeless people, being homeless  isn't the most scary thing. What's the most scary is to lose hope. Homelessness is like drowning, it takes away your hope bit by bit, until you totally give up.

Finally, after thinking about life and death for almost an hour, I got to the Starbucks. I was sweating from head to toes. All sunny day and I looked like I was just washed by a hurricane. 

After getting the money, I walked in and ordered an ice coffee, then I went to the bathroom to change all my clothes. 

Now I'm back to the library, I was thinking about getting out before getting recognized but I found that they have a different librarian today. That good, I can finally sleep tight again.

That's all I got.

I went to the food bank first to get some food, got a tuna sandwich, PB&J, some snacks, a piece of left over cake, and a bottle of water. I'm pretty satisfied with all these. Then I started my journey to the public library, the bus stop was a mile away. When I was waiting for the bus I suddenly realized I forgot the charger for my phone and laptop! Then I had to head back and begged the landlord to open the door for me. All that unnecessary journey plus the hot muggy weather of Baltimore almost drove me crazy. 

Good thing is library is really cold and quiet, I used my phone and scheduled a study room and had a nice nap. After waking up I started searching everything I need from online, including shelter, temp work, food, etc. Then I listed my laptop on OfferUp and craiglist, hope the buyer will appear soon.

I got locked into the library!

I had so much stuff too, a lot of new stuff as well, but at least I did not lose my life. I developed severe PTSD. I already had PTSD due to domestic violence and being raped, but it has gotten worse since the fire. I was the last one left in the house and I almost did not make it out. The fire got so bad that I could not leave out the front door. I had to leave out of my bedroom window, which was on the second floor. I had to sit on the awning, next to huge continuous black smoke coming out from my window, while I waited for a ladder to help me down. I was terrified.

After the fire I had no where to go and no money, no friends or no family, so I had to stay on the street. I was too scared to go to a shelter. I lived under a bridge for four months. At first it was not too bad, but as time went on it got worse. It got hotter which was awful for me. I am super sensitive to the heat to the point where I actively avoid it. I actually have vitamin d deficiency because of it. I would rather have been homeless in the winter. You can bundle up as much as you want, but you can not do much when you are hot. Plus you want to stay covered because of mosquitoes and other bugs. Other than the heat, my spot would smell a lot after it rained and it would linger for days. The worst part of being homeless was the depression, which I am sure many of you would agree.

I am writing this to tell everyone to not give up. I am no longer homeless. I am so grateful to finally have a roof over my head again. It took a while, but it was worth it. I wish everyone the best in their journey. ❤️",2022-07-18 06:28:41,2022,7,18,6,28,41

*I am also not asking for anything*

Today I panhandled in a super high class area with a chill vibe in hopes I would make enough scroungings to feed me and my cat for awhile (bad idea financially I know), and I've made $10 in like 5 hours here. In 5 hours in a shitty neighborhood I can make more than $50. *Why are the people who have the money so stingy with it.* If I had the means to get a job, I'd have one.

If I was gonna spend it all on fucking drugs or beer I wouldn't have weight on me, teeth only stained yellow from nicotine, and clear complexion on my face. If I was really just using my cat for sympathy, she wouldn't sit on my shoulders in loud ass stressful traffic. The only way to get people in a brand new Mercedes-Benz to actually care is if I'm ABSOLUTELY suffering, and it's reluctant at best. I get it's their money, but why does a poor person who shouldn't be giving me $40 have more compassion than someone who has so much money $40 is like pennies. Why is a homeless person more likely to throw me a couple dollars than grandpa in his new BMW. This is fucked up and shows where we are as a society. If you aren't a worker bee you deserve to die in their eyes. Ignoring me doesn't help the problem. My cat is still hungry. I'm still hungry. I'm still broke. I still can't get a job. I still can't afford anything. I still have to stand here.

It's not like I don't try, I have seasonal income that's legitimate, but seasonal isn't enough for a whole year. It's hard to get a traditional job when you live outside and have legitimate mental problems that inhibits alot of my abilities. People lack compassion the more money they gather because you can't get rich without fucking people over first.

For anyone in Denver, I have 3 or 4 pairs of lightly used sneakers in a Size 6 womens (size 7.5 mens).

I’m really into sneakers and so was my ex/best friend, so I bought these shoes for her for various special occasions. However, she passed away last year, but her roommate/ex was gracious enough to give the shoes back to me.

I was initially thinking I would just keep them to remember her by, but I know she would’ve wanted me to give them to ladies who need them.

Theres 3 pairs of Air Jordans and  1 pair of SB Dunks, if any ladies are familiar with sneakers. I also can probably find some hoodies and t shirts of hers (she was around 5’6” and skinny-ish), along with used socks (clean, of course). There are probably a few pairs of clean underwear, too, but I’m not sure if it’s acceptable to offer those (I know when I was struggling bad, I would’ve taken a clean pair of used boxers, but maybe dudes are different? 🤷🏻‍♂️). 

And if you happen to be taller/bigger and like mens clothing (streetwear, so tees and hoodies), I’d be happy to give away some of my clothes, too, Size XL (I might have some L’s around).

Lastly, if you’re of legal age and smoke weed, I’d be glad to give you a pre-roll. I bought a few specifically to give away to people in need, so I’d be glad to give you one. Hopefully, that’s not against the rules here.",2022-07-10 14:11:26,2022,7,10,14,11,26

Minimum wage in my state (CA) is $15/hr. Housing on the lower end is like $1000/month (and that’s with a bunch of roommates). If you worked full time, you would be bringing in a whopping $2400 a month. This doesn’t meet the 3x rent criteria so you are already going to be struggling here.

So, to sum up, is it possible to technically survive on minimum wage working full time? Maybe, if you are really tight with money and have a lot of roommates. It isn’t going to be easy though. You are going to need two jobs realistically, but not everyone wants to do that nor should they have to imo. At that point being homeless seems like an easier option than spending your entire life at work just to have a roof over your head. So your options are: be a slave to your employer and spend every waking minute at work and have no free time, or be homeless.

And all this is assuming they can even get a job in the first place. It’s not easy to get a job in this economy and a lot of places don’t hire people with a criminal record.

v7s8s5,117,dark_wolf1994,18,homeless,Oklahoma. I 100% smelled a body at a homeless camp but can't find it,"Backstory- I've found a several-week dead person before and know EXACTLY what that smells like.

I'm in central Oklahoma. There is someone staying in a tent by the river. They have been for a couple years now actually. Today, while working near the river bridge, I smelled *that smell.* Had to stop working, I was going to throw up. I know what I smelled. 

Me and a coworker drove the few hundred feet down the road and went down to the tent- a short walk through a trail that had been well defined, but was now starting to grow up with short bushes. Boots were at the entrance of the tent, standing next to each other. An empty pan was sitting next to the ashes of a campfire, clothes were hanging on the line, mildew covered due to the last week of rain. An animal had torn the tent open and food wrappers were strewn about. Everything looked like someone had just left it suddenly, and had been gone about a week.

I couldn't smell the smell by the tent though- it seemed to be coming more from downriver. The grass and weeds were too thick to go down there, and we had to get back to work. The police weren't interested in coming out because they said it was most likely a deer. 

It's absolutely possible that the person got help from someone, was arrested, or decided to just dip out.... But this doesn't sit right with me. I know something is wrong. I know what I smelled. I'm unable to get around by the river and don't know what to do.

If anyone is able or willing to search, knows how to help, or might know the person, I can PM location details, and the name that I saw painted on the side of the tent- I don't want to blast this person all over though. I just want to be sure they're okay... and if they aren't, they deserve a proper resting place.

UPDATE: I finally got contact with the right person and two police officers came out, and had me go out there with them. It rained all day today, after making this post. As soon as I pulled up I was *slammed* with the stench of death. The officers didn't smell it, but poked around for about 15 minutes before calling it off. They didn't bring dogs. I just feel like something isn't right though.",2022-06-08 09:27:08,2022,6,8,9,27,8

I'm a women. I've stayed in a few shelters where I had stuff stolen from me. I've also slept in a tent on the street where i awoke to a homeless man pepper spraying me in the face in an attempt to rape or steal from me. (Someone driving by heard me screaming and pulled over, thwarting the man's plan.)

The point I'm trying to make is it isn't sunshine and roses out there. If you can go to a shelter, please go! ( That might mean avoiding California, where every single person will tell you to go.

v40kiz,82,Think_Ad2385,12,homeless,Uplifting post for homeless teens,"So I just been reflecting on my youth. To all you homeless teens out there I will tell you this don't give up. I was raised by two drug addict parents who cared more about getting their next fix then taking care of their child. I was homeless from age 13 to 16 I dug in trash can lived under under passes I did what I had to do to survive. I got odd jobs cleaning pools and Landscaping to get money. I moved in and lived in the garage till I turned 18. I know it's hard going to school especially if you can't bathe and your clothes are not nice. I know it's hard getting made fun of and picked on. Been there done that. I'm telling you this in hopes that you might see it just to give you that little inspiration to fight on continue trying and pursuing your education in your dreams.

As hard as it was I continue through school even though it was constantly picked on I even went to college while high school using the money I I got from collecting cans doing odd jobs. Granted tuition was only $13 a credit hour back then. When I turned eighteen I decide to join the military. It was a hard process not having my social security card birth certificate all those things that were needed but they help me out during my time in the military continue to go to school and got my college degree. After leaving the military I started my life and went to medical school I became a doctor back in 2007. So why am I telling you all this so that you know that your destiny is not yet written. Yes there's a hell of an uphill battle and it's hard as hell never give up. Keep fighting keep trying no matter what you want to do in life go for it. Don't let anybody put you down just because of the circumstances surrounding your life. Most of you don't realize that the struggles that you endeavor it made you a formidable opponent strong person that can persevere in the most hellish circumstances you're a force to be reckoned with. Your life experience what you experience and what you've seen it made you stronger than you could ever imagine probably don't even realize your own potential",2022-06-03 08:25:32,2022,6,3,8,25,32
v1mmac,3,Hhhhhhhhhhghftjbgkj,9,homeless,My mom is newly homeless,"My 65 year old mom live across the country from me and was evicted from her long term apartment about a month ago… the apartment she was living in was owned by my grandparents and when they died her siblings fought to get even with her financially. My mom fought tooth and nail with them for years to stay in this apartment as it was part of a lengthy property agreement and part of the family estate. Since my grandparents have died my mom has been disowned from her immediate family and was recently officially evicted from the apartment.

She is a hoarder and stayed until the last possible moment, waiting for the police to forcibly remove her. She is very manipulative and controlling even manipulating the police initially to letting her stay longer under the premise that she “might have covid” when they showed up a week or so earlier to remove her. She also has severe mental disabilities which have gone undiagnosed as well as health issues which according to her keep her from working the last 15+ years. I’ve always believed she could work as she is perfectly fine volunteering in gardening centers and going on boat outings with her friends. I have tried applying to jobs for her and putting tighter resumes, and it has always ended up being a waste of my time. At the end of the day she will use her health as an excuse for the fact that she does not want to work and I can’t force an adult to follow through being financially independent and responsible.


I just graduated college and am getting married in 3 weeks… my time and energy is very limited and I have anguish at night thinking about her and her situation. I don’t know how to help her and have limited resources. She has been couch surfing so far at a friends but she is no longer able to stay there. She also has a 60lb senior dog that is not helping her homelessness because a lot of the opportunities where she might have somewhere to stay would not accommodate her dog. This senior dog also wasn’t even hers initially and she adopted him a few years ago from an irresponsible family member who decided they just didn’t want him anymore. 

Honestly my mom should never been given this dog with her mental illnesses and hoarding. She constantly is screaming out loud and acting irrationally unable to control her emotions which makes her poor dog look nervous. On top of that he is a senior dog with mobility issues and he has been forced to live with her in a hoarder house where he is unable to walk normally in a regular living situation, nonetheless a hoarder one. He has been forced to live in an environment because of her where he has to squeeze between valleys  of hoarder mess that she creates and has limited space to even drink water or lay down. I’m trying to get her to give up the dog to someone with a stable living situation. 

My mom is extremely controlling and has psychotic episodes. My entire life she has tortured me and abused me not only physically but mentally and emotionally. Regardless at the end of the day I love and care for her deeply. But I definitely cannot live with her ever again. I moved out of the house right when I turned 18 and I never went back. We have a strained relationship and I can’t help but hold animosity towards her despite me loving her. Originally my fiancé and I were talking about buying a home with a mother in law suite that she could live in but I’m realizing more and more that would never work.

She was just visiting us and staying with us in our home and it was actual torture. Everyday she fought  and screamed with my fiancé over the smallest of things. Literally one night  she screamed and fought with him from 11pm until 6am. She also would pick him apart over every little thing he did on top of actively shit talking him anytime he left the room and trying to get me to call off the wedding. If it’s not her way with her control than she will argue you to death until you give in to her. She will also do wildly in appropriate things and have no regard for my fiancés and I’d feelings or wishes. Such as during this trip insisting on inappropriately  hanging out with our landlords and spreading all of her delusions and lies to them regarding my fiancé and I, and our relationship.

A huge part of this also has to do with her undiagnosed disabilities- my mom hallucinates and has a hard time deciphering reality from fantasy especially when it comes to memories or situations which she experienced… she has all sorts of wild obscure stories which definitely never occurred which she uses to castrate my fiancé despite him investing hours of time into her on his own and genuinely caring about her.  And when she is met with reason to the delusions and lies she tells she will gaslight, scapegoat, scream, get aggressive and blame anyone and everyone but herself. She is very difficult to interact with and she truly is toxic. Even when she isn’t having an aggressive outburst or hyper dividing on a delusion, her behavior generally is abnormal and bizarre. 

I love my mom and I’m genuinely scared for her. I know for a fact that I can’t have her  live with me without losing my mind as well as ruining my marriage. How can I help my mom and where can she go? She is not rational and is burning every bridge she has. She is open to moving to another state but is in Illinois currently. She also doesn’t think she hallucinates or has anything wrong with her, she instead just blames it on being “spiritual” and think she’s psychic.

Right away I noticed people treating me strange, which I’m used to because of my disability I don’t always come off as normal but this was different and it was freaking me out. It’s like they were being mean and polite at the same time. When the doctor finally came in he looked like he had been awake for a really long time and was sort of out of it. He walked in and just says what’s the problem with a mean face.  I tell him about my ear and he says let me get something to look at it, leaves the room for five seconds, comes back empty handed and grabs a scope off the wall he was just standing next to. Then he shoves it forcefully into my ear and I say that hurts really bad, he looks for a few more seconds, pulls the scope out, then jams it in again more aggressively and deeper and there is an excruciating pinch inside my ear so I yell out that really hurts, but he ignores me. When he pulls it out he just says I think it’s a canal infection so no pills just ear drops, and leaves. My ear is killing me when they finally bring the drops and discharge papers and I’m struggling to keep it together and when I got out of the room I just blurted how do I get out of here and power walked out the way they said. 

Today my ear is worse so I called the hospital to file a complaint. The administrator called me back and basically said the doctor did nothing wrong. I’m planning to go to an urgent care on Monday for someone else to look at it. 

Just because I live in my car, and look like it, doesn’t mean I shouldn’t be treated as a person, especially not by medical professionals.",2022-05-27 21:56:17,2022,5,27,21,56,17

My least favorite part of being homeless is being alone, especially at night. I sit here and miss my family who have pasted on, miss my friends I once spoke with. 

I seen a family today, mom/dad with two kids, playing together outside in their yard. Having an absolute blast. I burst into tears. And I'm no cry baby lol. But watching that family hit me hard. Will I ever have that? Forget a house, forget money. I want a family to call my own. I wanna be able to call my mom or dad after a long day. I want someone to make memories with, grow together. I haven't had that in so long. Years. 

I haven't had these thoughts in awhile but, I was in the hospital recently. During this time I realized, I really have no family now. They have all pasted. Nurse was asking the usual info and she asked that ""emergency contact"" question. If I died tonight, there would be no one to call and say ""I'm sorry but CarryOnRonnie has pasted"".

Someone tell me this isn't a life sentence,"I used to tell myself I will not let this be the rest of my life when I was a 16 year old sleeping in the park crashing on my friend's couch. I thought it was so easy back then, all I had to do was survive to 18 and get a job, then I could get my own place. I've never been so wrong in my life. I turned 18 and couldn't get hired, I didn't know it until then but I had grown up in a town where work is notoriously scarce, and I came of age well after the housing market collapsed in the US so even back then wages weren't competing with rent. There was only one shelter and it was so infested with bed bugs that when my friend spent just one night there he came out covered in red welts. When I visited the place to ask for resources, I saw people laying in the dirt outside the building, it was hard to tell whether they were dead or just high. So I made the jump and got on a bus, left all my friends and what family I had left behind, threw myself into the unknown in hopes I could make a life for myself away from that place. 4 years I've been from shelter to shelter, drop in centers, psychiatric hospitals. I got on the right medication. My mental health improved, I started working. I got a section 8 voucher. Life in the shelter system was hell, but I kept thinking of that voucher and the vision of the life I was still holding on to in my mind, a normal, stable life. When I held that voucher in my hands the first time I thought it was all over, like I was finally out. Nine months have passed and I'm back on the street, barely holding on to my job, went to a drop in center yesterday and now waiting for placement in another shelter. Out of curiosity I googled the place this center called for me, and once I saw the pictures of multiple beds in one cubicle something in me snapped. I have avoided drugs for so many years but I would do anything to numb this pain right now. I wish that I could stop seeing, hearing, smelling, feeling, I want to scream. I want to take this voucher and rip it into pieces and then set it on fire. I'm so angry, what is the point of striving to work and make money and learn new things and have human connections with others when the summary of my entire life is confined to a cube smaller than a jail cell that I will likely be sharing with somebody addicted to meth?

upir1n,23,ch1253,93,homeless,How do we become homeless in the US,"No disrespect but being a foreigner it sometimes perplexes me how people in the US become homeless when so many high-paying jobs are available. I know a few exceptions, which would create problems getting this job. But even then I don't see any reason. People risk their lives getting into the US but I am seeing people homeless in hear.

\-Lot of depth

\-Criminal record

\-Body injuries

&#x200B;

\### Seeing most of the responses here is my reply/ comments/questions

The US has a dysfunctional healthcare system.

The US is misusing its land for beautification and keeping food prices high.

Why a homeless person does not move to some small cities where rents are much much cheaper. I have seen 200-300$ apartments.

Why when some people have the time, why don't they take dart cheap health care in some other countries? That would balance the high demand for health care.

The US has a dysfunctional real state system.  I mean some leaving place should be available that can be rent in a few 2-3$per days with only access to an only basic necessity (common bathroom and shower).

The US has a dysfunctional business CSR. Why these large businesses are not doing some sort of service.

Last week one of the people I know risked his life to come to the US, and now he is in jail.

In my country, The people who live in the slums (5-10$/month) (food (60-80$/month).  (shitty but available govt-funded free health care) spends a good time compared to homeless people in the US.

uk9bhf,34,HatAccomplished2143,178,homeless,Are You Homeless and Being Gangstalked,"I've been studying the phenomenon of gangstalking for awhile now and am also a victim myself. Many people who call themselves Targeted Indviduals claim that one of the main goals of gangstalking is to drive a person to homelessness. They have pushed me to the brink a couple times by hacking job applications and keeping me from gaining employment, I finally had to resort to places that had paper applications.

During this time I went to a city to speak to a senator's aide about some issues related to my situation. I stayed at a mission and found several who say they are being gangstalked. Strange things happened, people I had never met knew things about my situation. I was actually assaulted while there by a knife wielding woman yelling out things that were relevant to my situation. 

The gangstalkers work to make the target appear crazy. If they have a drug or mental health issue they exploit it, that way when they have them in the system they can just claim they were crazy or on drugs.

I'm just wondering how many of you have encountered people who claim they are being gangstalked or are victims yourself. I'm trying to compile commonalities to get this phenomenon recognized as reality. The fact that so many say the gangstalker's goal is to drive them to homelessness and suicide is a strong indicator that this is reality. How could so many people have the same shared delusion. Not all are homeless they do their best to work and keep a roof over their head, but obstacles one endures can often make death seem like a better option.",2022-05-07 03:01:23,2022,5,7,3,1,23

When I got in line, there was a lady two people in front of me, in her 50s, obviously on the street, trying to buy some bread and bologna. There wasn’t enough money on her EBT for it and the clerk immediately got an attitude and talking down to her until she left in shame. After she left the clerk started saying something a long the lines of: they live off our taxes and then get upset about not having enough of our money to spend. I was in shock as it happened and I moved over to the self checkout to avoid being shamed also. I drove around looking for her afterwards to share some food, but I can’t find her.

ui4n2j,82,WinterAd188,49,homeless,Local Walmart Was Towing Cars Last Night,"This morning at about 2:30 am I got ""towed"" at a Walmart that I have park at for 2-3 nights a week (no more than two nights in a row) at with out problems for at least seven months. It doesn't have any ""no overnight parking"" signs. There usually 2 to 8  trucks, several RVs and a lot of cars most nights. I've never had security ask me to leave. I woke up to the sound of this tow truck hooking me up. I was sleeping in the driver seat with the keys in the ignition. I started the car but as soon as I was put it into reverse the tow truck driver had lifted the front of the car. The driver demanded $100 to ""drop the car"". It had to either be paid in cash or ""cash app"". He said several people had already paid him in the parking lot a few minutes earlier. I downloaded the app, made an account and added my debit card to pay him. Well I did this the driver kept spitting on the ground and puffing on his vape. I told the tow truck driver all he would have had to do was honk his horn or knock on my window and I would leave. He responded arrogantly ""then I wouldn't make any money"". After he let me down, he quickly drove over to a van that was beside me. I honked my horn several times at the van. Hoping to wake them up in time. This obviously annoyed the tow truck driver. The tow truck driver had started on one side of the parking lot and was working his way across the parking lot getting his $100 from everyone. While the tow truck was busy with the van, I knocked on the windows of 6 other cars and vans and waking them up and telling them what was happening. While I was waking up the fifth car, a second tow truck arrived on scene. After knocking on the sixth car window, the two tow trucks try to block me off. I escaped and then drove around the parking lot making sure everyone was awake. The two remaining cars I wasn't able worn had there dome lights on and we're awake from all the racket. I hope they were able to find their keys, start their cars and get out of there in time. After that I check the second parking lot on the side of Walmart. I didn't see any car campers or RVers there. I'm not certain Walmart hired/called the tow company or the tow truck drivers saw an opportunity to make some easy bucks.",2022-05-04 05:43:58,2022,5,4,5,43,58

ub8hbo,4,peakedattwentytwo,20,homeless,Just a Question (for Americans),"Why, when recycling bins are present, do so many of you throw your bottles, cans, and plastic cups on the ground??? I *guarantee* the attitudes of many of your housed countrypeople toward you would improve if you did not. In fact, the area behind my apartment building is small and wooded, and often enough, folks try to sleep there, frequently succeeding. However, they leave the detritus of their drink and drug use on the ground instead of putting it in any of the four big blue bins clearly marked 'Recycle'. In my town, they are known as Rosies.

I used to not mind so much until this year, when a formerly recently homeless new tenant apparently told his buddies they could crash in the treed area bordering the little parking lot. In addition, I've found 5 shopping carts full of stinky shit left there during the daytime when they go off on their coordinated begging missions. I called the stores they belonged to, and the cops, but no one was interested in retrieving them, so into the nearest dumpster they went, along with all of the stinky crap, some of which contained uncapped needles. That's where it will go again.

I used to not mind. I've been homeless myself, and now work a job I hate because I'm older, for one, and just can't tolerate the contempt for the homeless that I, somewhat ironically, now possess myself! It didn't have to be that way.

u4gzw0,1,RoyalMWP123,13,homeless,How do we help end homelessness?,"I have an idea for how we can help end homelessness but it’s definitely a stretch and I want to know your guys opinions on it, but before I tell you let me first say this is still in the ideas phase and isn’t fully fleshed out and I do understand there’s a lot of flaws and things that would have to be put into this, please lend some constructive criticism and comments on what you think would make this a better idea in the comments and I look forward to some civilized discussion.

So my idea is that a community of people donates their money and time to open a homeless support center, this is going to provide a place to sleep, a bathroom to freshen up, some new clothes if needed and serves 3 meals a day. This centers purpose is to give people a temporary home while also helping them get back on their feet, they can stay as long as they need and there will be events happening all the time providing them a quick job to get some work experience, they also can use our computers to make a resume and they can use the buildings address on their resume, they also can use our phone numbers too and there will be a whole team that takes phone calls and notifies them when a job offer comes in or an interview!

While they are living here they will continue to work freelance gigs we provide as well as search for a full time job, with our address they can make a bank account for savings and once they’ve saved enough they can move out to live on their own given they’re able to provide for themselves. And when someone needs to move out we will have more jobs posted for others to help them move in as well as buy the furniture and utilities they need, this not only allows the others to get more work experience but it also helps bring people together in the community.

(This next part would most likely be later on when there’s more funding and people to help) there also will be an educational center where anyone can get an education and get their degree if needed, this is helpful for younger homeless people and those who struggled to graduate, and if they need more time to get the degree we will provide them more time. 

Like I said this is all just in the ideas phase but let me know what you think, would this be helpful? And would this help end homelessness?",2022-04-15 14:26:38,2022,4,15,14,26,38

Were you ever in a situation where you didn’t have access to basic necessities; including oral hygiene products, deodorant, shampoo, body wash, or menstrual care items?

Did you ever not know the next time you would be able to brush your teeth or take a shower?

Did you ever frequent homeless shelters or churches, hoping they might be able to provide those hygiene necessities?

I had to go through a relatively affluent area, not really a neighborhood, just a couple of blocks where the residents are generally upper middle or even upper class.

I was just trying to get to the centre to eat and shower, but a well dressed couple came around the corner as I was nearing the end of the block, and they looked at me and fucking pointed at me. Then they LAUGHED.

I'm not talking about the quick awkward laugh that people make when they are nervous. I'm talking about a full, mean spirited, condescending laugh that absolutely knocked the wind out of my soul.

The woman nudged her head at me as they passed me and they were whispering to each other.

Why are people like this? Why do I have to endure this torture when I'm just trying to make my way to a place where I can clean up and eat?

I am trying to change that. I work where I can, save money where I can, and definitely try and do my part in society.

But what really hurts me the most isn't the cold or the humiliation, it's the fact that people are willing to go out of their way to make my life miserable.

Minding my own business in the library? Dirty looks, finger pointing, maybe even a few bold selfies that weren't even hidden that well.

Going to work looking like crap because despite not sleeping or eating well for weeks, I still want to turn my life around? Stares from people, comments that I'm a junkie, more dirty looks.

I find it so hard to stay optimistic when I go out there every single day and get beaten down by the misplaced opinions and judgements of people who are fortunate enough to have a place to sleep in, and three meals a day.

It's not only me. I see plenty of other homeless get this treatment as well. It's absolutely soul sucking. I'm lucky enough not to have been beaten up just for being homeless, like some people I know who don't have a violent bone in their body. They just look a bit ungroomed.

I shower every couple days, shave my beard, and try and replace my clothes when possible, but I can't hide the bags under my eyes, nor the uncomfortable feeling of feeling out of place. My items may not stink, but they are old and look worn out.

I hate that I try and do everything right, don't touch booze or drugs, work even when my legs are about to give out, and still get looked at like I'm some sort of parasite.

It's making me suicidal. Not that anyone would care if I bit the dust. Bleak but true.

sr330o,5,Dr4gonWaifu,2,homeless,Honestly reddit I know I'm overreacting but I just want to go home,"My friend just tagged me in a post on Facebook and there's the home that I grew up in being auctioned off. I'm overwhelmed with so many emotions. It was the only home I ever knew I've been there since I was a baby I had my own room. I played within those walls for hours. I learned how to cook in the kitchen. I used to venture around the yard and have fun. There was even a nice park in the neighborhood.

Many of my dogs and cats are buried in that yard. Even my guinea pig mocha. I live there with my grandma until she died. The moment she died many of my family members ushered me and my siblings out so they can get the house cleaned up and sell it all they cared about was money they didn't even care if we had anywhere to go.

I remember the day she died everyone came home with us and argued about who got what furniture. I'm autistic, 26 years old... Grandma died when I was 21. I don't qualify for disability because I'm too smart. And I've worked many jobs and even got my own GED. I just got out of academy for grooming dogs. 

About 5 years later I'm still homeless since being kicked out. I just don't make enough to rent. At least not yet I'm still trying to get through my 200 haircuts to make commission pay. Even then I doubt I'd be able to afford anywhere as nice as my old home was. My heart aches knowing that I'll never be able to go in my old room again. I think me being autistic just makes it harder for me to adapt to the fact that I'll never have that home again.

Id honestly do anything to have that home again but there's nothing that can be done and it just breaks my heart.  Right now I live in a broken down RV in the roof leaks when it rains and the insulation is horrible. None of my appliances work. It is literally falling apart around me. But I can't afford better right now and it really hurts knowing that my home will be sold off for good. I wish it was easier to cope with.

I've never been homeless but I've lived in a city before and hated how overpriced everything was. Moving to a rural area was a good call.

edit: ok turns out this idea is stupid. Nevermind. What the homeless really need is some kind of safe zone where they have drinkable water, safes for their belongings, showers, typical park exercise equipment, decent living conditions, training in employable skills, that sort of thing could help them find jobs in the city and save up.

I only know my phone, ipad, and computer were in the car along with most of my other needs and things. The area I was parked in has a lot of transient activity I wasn't aware before leaving my car idling. I only left the car on bc I was gonna be in and out of the store but someone beat me back to it.

The cop that arrived wasn't very helpful and seemed like he had better things to do. I was having a severe panic attack and the paramedics that arrived with the cop were very kind helping me.

The business I was inside of camera only recorded detected motion of me pulling into their parking lot but not the person driving away in my car.. Something about motion only picking up large groups of ppl or big moving objects like cars. The only activity on camera following my car theft was when the cops arrived. There were no other cameras around that could pick up anything except for a warehouse but I was told ppl aren't always working in the warehouse so no one answered when I knocked. Definitely going back.

It started snowing immediately after this happened so I couldn't walk around to try and find it. I was told by a few of the business employees and customers that sometimes ppls cars are found but not in the same condition :(

Apple can't find my phone bc I have a 2 step verification so I have to wait for them to verify my acct which could take days? This is so insane to me! I'm truly baffled by all of the technology and cameras in our world for things like this but none of it helped me today. If Apple could track the phone or ipad, maybe the car could be located too... if they didn't throw the phone out of the window.

Right now, I have no phone, no car, no clothes or other necessities... I have only my purse and IDs and what I went to the store for on me now...  but I was able to get a room nearby for the night. I feel like an idiot and I'm embarrassed and just lost.

We're nonbinary, a stranger would see two lesbians with rockin' but not-so-ladylike beards. We're extremely disabled (as in barely able to stand for long periods of time and constantly in agonizing pain) but do not qualify for benefits such as Medicaid/SSI/SNAP/basically anything people with no income need. My spouse is unable to work and we barely scraped by with my remote sales job until I got fired in November. Job applications, gigs, results were fruitless. We don't have friends or family to rely on (former category is broke and not local, latter is abusive and got us in this mess) for help. We don't have a car and only $30 in cash to our name. We've maxed out all our credit cards due to medical emergencies. **Just to clarify, I am not sharing this information to ask for donations.** This is to illustrate our situation.

As for local resources, we're extremely afraid of facing violent discrimination as a gay trans crippled fat couple. I know, oppression bingo right? LOL anyways, we're living in an already dangerous neighborhood and want to get out ASAP so someone doesn't beat the shit out of us. Because there's so few resources, we don't have much of a plan except to keep surviving with what little we have. My concerns are police, secluded places to sleep, and what to prioritize purchasing.

s1zgw4,5,ASL_Saiyan,5,homeless,My GF and I are homeless by choice. With a Ford Escape. And honestly it's been great,"I lived in the same apartment for 5 years now. When my ex left me in the first 2 years I was living there, I needed help paying the rent. So I let someone rent the big bedroom and I stayed in the 2nd tiny room. Everything was great as far as being single. Go to work, play video games. Go back to work. New roommate was milking disability benefits for a leg injury that had been fixed a long time ago. I think if you can walk a mile to the grocery store you are no longer a person with a leg disability. He stayed home 24/7. Never had the apartment to myself for 2 years straight. He didn't take showers and reeked up the whole apartment. But hey, he payed his rent and that's all I cared about. I could tolerate it. I met my deaf girlfriend. She moved in after awhile and I still accepted the small bedroom. Everything was cool for a year. Then my roomate became a wannabe streamer for a cell phone game. I think RAID Shadow Legends or some shit like that. I could hear him streaming and talking to whatever viewers he had. I thought cool at least he's doing something. He never made any income yet on his streaming, so I assumed it was lame and had like 3 viewers. After a year of living with my GF we started having problems. My girlfriend has 3 kids not in her custody and they came to visit sometimes and spend the night. Usually every other weekend. Roomate couldn't handle the noise of kids having fun in the living room. He refused to close his door because my cats were his only friends. On top of that my GF liked to stay busy and clean the house. And being a deaf person you can't hear how loud you may be. But she enjoyed cleaning and couldn't go back to work until her hand got better. She had lots of pain in her right hand. All of a sudden my roommate starts complaining about noise and how it interrupted his streaming and his life. He said living with my GF was like hell. My GF never interacted with him. Then he started coming out of his room when my GF was cleaning the apartment to stare at her and make her uncomfortable so she will stop cleaning. She no longer wanted to stay in the house during the day. So I said ok, we will work on moving out and she will go to her mom's house during the day while I work. Then I told my roommate don't worry you will have the apartment to yourself now everyday. We will only be there at night to shower and sleep. He said things like ""good, it's like hell living with her, she does meth and tweaks and cleans all day"". My GF does not do drugs or even drink so I laughed. He said she wants to take advantage of me and have a baby with me. And I laughed again because my GFs tubes are tied and doesn't want anymore kids. And he just kept talking shit in general and demanded that it's quiet and I tell him whenever someone is coming over. At this point I was like WTF. This man is incredibly toxic as fuck and I've been nothing but nice to him. So my GF and I said fuck this. We packed some shit and ate sleeping in our Ford Escape at her friends place who live in an RV on their own property. It's nice out here. You can see the stars and it's out in nature. I still go to work and do doordash. Except now I can save all my hard earned money for our own place. It's like this stress has been lifted off my chest. No more rent, no more electric bill, no more internet bill. No more gas bill. I shut all that shit off and left my roomate to fend for himself. He will not be able to afford that place by himself. And I was willing to give him advance notice about moving out. But after all the shit he talked, what do you expect. I type this on my phone as I enjoy a beer outside our SUV before I get ready to go to sleep. Can use our friends shower in their RV. Their BBQ. Everything is good. Just thought I would share my story. Hope everyone is well",2022-01-11 23:30:59,2022,1,11,23,30,59

It is extremely dangerous in California. I am going to repeat this. It is EXTREMELY dangerous in California, especially if you are female. Please reconsider.

Why is no one trying smaller towns with lower population of both people and homeless people? 

Why not New Mexico or Arizona? Find a town with a couple shelters that is on a flixbus/Greyhound bus line, call the shelters and ask if they have room for you. 

Look at crime statistics. Find somewhere safe. 

I am not just another homeless person here. I am someone to them because there are significantly less homeless here.

rpd37r,3,siliconscrolls,26,homeless,Why does land exclusion exist?,"Property does not shrink because someone uses it. The reason it's not free is because of hoarding, & the notion that might equals right. There's zero basis for excluding anyone from owning property, except greed, or *to make the economy work*, which is to say that our economy depends on false scarcity.

And for everything the land produces, like trees, it's not *supply and demand* that ultimately decides what's available, it's *the earth*. Supply & demand might motivate a land owner to permit a logging company to come through and chop down trees, & it might motivate someone to plant new trees, but it's the land and the eco-system that *make the trees*. 

How did they get that land that they getta decide who can or cannot take trees from it? Well, it began with land theft.

There's zero justification for a limitted number of people owning the majority of the natural resources. I defy anyone to justify it.

Our economic system as it is would not exist if it wasn't for land theft.

I just want a small patch of land, to pitch a tent, or build a shitty little cabin, but I can't because it'd be a threat to the imposed scarcity that our economy... or *the rich, rather*, rely on. That scarcity is the real model is evidenced when a homeless person can't even have a tent on unused land for very long. They're always chasing us off. Why? Is it really freeloading to take residence on the earth?

 I'll gladly work for food & whatever else I need.  It's the scarcity of land that I don't understand. There's no justification for it. 

What would be the cost of living if it wasn't for fat cats extracting wealth from us for having the right to land?

EDIT: I'm not arguing for or against any economic system. I'm not educated enough for all that. I just wanna know how you justify land exclusion.

EDIT 2: To anyone that promotes destruction, this is my response. *I* believe in democracy, grassroots movements, power in numbers. If we gain these things, destruction isn't necessary. *You* believe, apparently, in *the right people/person* taking power. That's dictatorship.",2021-12-26 20:06:38,2021,12,26,20,6,38

rhz6j8,83,BYE2LIFE,102,homeless,Who else feels lied to? Antiwork+Anticapitalsm,"Capitalism is embedded into us beginning in childhood. But, sometimes, this trick doesn't work on all of us :D

As long as capitalism exists, we'll always have homelessness, hunger and poverty in this world. It's been said that capitalism creates jobs but it's never called out for producing homelessness, hunger, poverty, and even death. As for creating jobs, who would need a job if natural resources such as shelter and food were free?... as they should be.

We're told to work hard... go to college.... build an empire... but what we're not told is that if we don't do these things, we will likely fail miserably in our capitalist economy. Being told to work hard & go to college... isn't for our own good btw. It's the only way to keep capitalism which is our economy... afloat.

Why is nothing we're taught able to fix this broken world? With all of the college education, political parties, awareness, and resources-we can't figure out how to get along or end poverty. Or, how to overthrow the system that has us all trapped in economic bondage! Sadly, I think we're at a time in human existence where natural selection means every man for themselves! Adaptation and survival of the fittest isn't about biological factors anymore.... It has a whole new meaning... Money is the only survival tool needed for the future...bc health can only be bought now... those not financially prepared will remain in bondage or die off...

Would ending homelessness, hunger and poverty also end capitalism or just a huge chunk of it?

Edit: We think we're self sufficient but we're not. Working for others under a monetary system and having to hand all of your earnings into the hands of others for them to give you things you need when you can do those things yourself, is not self sufficiency. Seriously, is anyone out there fed up with the fact that everything we're taught all leads to this> you will work and buy until you die. We're crippled with illusions. All many of us do is work to make our employer richer and we buy things-rent, food, car, hobbies, entertainment, and bills. Everything around you is literally attached to money. How is just about every public building, including the one you call home, designed to extract money from you? Is anyone else out there disturbed that we're as lost as animals... being extorted out of all of our earnings and exploited into thinking we have to do back breaking work to have access to these things...

Christmas parties & bonuses are cool, but let's be clear, we should know by now we're all just the middle men that our employers use to take money from us and each other. Commercials and ads and every building you see outside of your home is designed to take money from you by providing a product or service that you didn't know you needed :D The law (and banks) backs up some of these products and services saying it's illegal to not have them... Laws are free promotion and advertising for certain businesses.

Capitalism doesn't bring anyone out of poverty bc poverty only exists in a capitalist world. Placing a price on natural resources such as wood and food and animals, and constantly telling others if they work for someone else by getting a job, they can have the things that they need... is just wrong and extreme psychosis. Capitalism constructs such as rent and mortgage are the reason ppl are homeless. Capitalism constructs such as insurance requirements, prevents many ppl from being able to seek medical help, especially preventative care. With all things considered, capitalism and greedy world is responsible for poverty, crime, and death.

It's strange you can work a job 40 hrs a week and still not earn enough to have a roof over your head... I, like many others on this sub, am not homeless by the choices I made... I went to college and swore off kids so I wouldn't be like my family members but guess what, I still work, I'm underpaid and can't afford a studio or 1 bdrm apt in my city so I live out of my car. The system is rigged and only those who are fortunate to own a businesses, or work in their field, or work in an in demand area are the ones who can live comfortably, but for the other half of ppl who still work 40+ hrs a week, they will go without what they need. And this is a system that has to be broken.. Everyone should be able to have housing regardless of employment status or income. That's the only way to fix the homeless problem is to make housing free for all bc clearly and sadly, having a job doesn't mean you'll have a home. I don't understand why this has to be workshopped, bc I am for free food and housing as a way to end poverty such as hunger and homelessness. ",2021-12-16 13:17:15,2021,12,16,13,17,15

Its annoying but I understand why they are doing what they are doing... but the problem is the system doesnt work and no one on staff cares.

So I get a job interview, I tell my CM about it two days before hand. The night of (the appointment is at 8pm at night because its a night time pizza delivery place only open from 4pm to 4am) I try to leave for the interview, and the desk people say theres no alert in the system!

I told the manager on duty at the store (the one I was supposed to have the interview with) about the situation and they said they would talk with the other hiring manager about rescheduling, but from her tone of voice Im not holding out any hope.

r9fii6,3,Herniethecat,2,homeless,Looking for some advice.,"Hi everyone,
 I just want to start by saying I'm not looking for a handout or anything like that, hopefully just some plain old advice. Im in the UK if that makes any difference to any advice that can be given.
 I used to live with my wife, our 2 cats and our little dog. 7 months ago we had some new neighbours move in underneath our flat. This was the beginning of hell for us. From day one we had problems. I'm not talking about noise, there was all the usual things like that but it was harrassment all day, even if we were in, they would spend all day banging the ceiling, calling my wife the worst names, that escalated to death threats which resulted in them smashing our bedroom window with a brick, trying to kick our front door in and throwing bottles at us. I'm Irish myself and there was a lot of Irish racism too. 
 The police were called, they did nothing. We had the girl on CCTV smashing the winwo, not enough evidence apparently, I sent the council and police CCTV of so many things happening. The council ""lost"" the footage and the police simply didn't care. This was happening EVERY day until my partner couldn't take it anymore and I found her after coming home from helping my dad move some things out of his place. She nearly died, it was very close. The hospital then discharged her to my parents shed. This is just an unheated storage room contains 20 years of belongings. We have been living there since September. I can't seem to find any help or way out. no one seems bothered at all from my MP to the mental health services, council, police etc. We are just stuck here. 
 My partner has serious mental health issues that have been made worse because of this. I have told our situation to anyone I can think of but I'm just getting nowhere. Obviously it's getting colder and hanging out in a shed at minus five degrees isn't fun at all.
 I am just my partner's carer, we aren't rich and can get accepted for private rental due to the credit checks, it's not that we have bad credit, we have no real credit. The council won't help at all. We are just stuck here with no where to go and no life at all.
 I have now been diagnosed with schizophrenia myself which has been brought ok because of this. I just don't know where to turn now. At one point the council was going to home us in a travelodge as you can bring your pets but they changed their mind on this (il assuming due to costs) and since then we have just been here. Not living, just existing.
 I'll stop here. If anyone would like more information I'd be happy to share. I'm just looking for some advice. To see if there's something I may have missed.
 I appreciate anyone has has read this far. I know there are people worse off than I am, I know there are people actually on the streets but this is unreal for me. I feel like I'm just losing my mind. It gets worse everyday and I have nowhere to reach out to.
 Thank you all again.",2021-12-05 06:15:49,2021,12,5,6,15,49

qtoyyc,0,AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,20,homeless,WHY I JOINED THIS SUB AND WHY I AM HERE!,"I'm  NOT saying donating plasma once, twice or infrequently will hurt your  long term health. What I am saying is consistently donating plasma over  long periods of time will eventually degrade your overall health. I've  worked with homeless people for over 35 years. Back in the day homeless  friends I helped donated plasma often as they were allowed to generate  survival income. I still remember the places names. Hyland Plasma  Services and Community Plasma Services. I used to wait for my homeless friends at the Roy Rodgers having breakfast while they were processed. The process of donating literally took half their day.

Today 35 years later these guys seem to have more medical issues.  Maybe it wasn't the plasma donations. These guys used to be alcoholics,  drug addicts, they used to participate in candidate prescription drug  studies, they did it all. They made money but to look at them now their  health shot. I don't think it was worth it long term. The problem is  poor people must survive today. Planning long term even for things vital  as health are luxuries \\ privileges enjoyed by the better off.

I was born into a very sheltered life. I come here because, I have  serious blinders on. Being autistic I tend to automatically ignore any  person or lifestyle that does not conform to my known experiences. I  used to ignore homeless people and their suffering until thankfully a  homeless man forced me to see his world his perspective as a street  homeless individual. He showed me street homelessness and did not  protect me for his lived reality back then. He showed me the rescue  mission. I was aghast at what I saw! This was in the 1980's.

Homelessness in 2021 has changed greatly since 1980 especially given  COVID19. I come here because I do not want my eyes to close and my heart  to harden against those who have no home. I come here because how can I  help if I don't know what is needed. As an autistic being I need  concrete understanding of homeless suffering to generate and maintain  empathy in the face of media and politicians who routinely blame the  homeless for their plight.

qtai16,83,FatCopsRunning,44,homeless,Advice to approach my homeless neighbor?,"I’m very likely being stupid about this, so if y’all could tell me how to best approach it, I’d appreciate it. 

A few months back, an abandoned house two doors down from us burned down and the fire caught our next door neighbors’ roof, so they moved out. Around September, we noticed a dude sleeping on their porch.  

The only time I’ve ever seen him was when I freaked him out by accident once while leaving for work late.  I looked over and we made eye contact and he looked so startled.  I gave him a peace sign, and I imagine he knows we don’t care that he’s sleeping there by now? 

Anyway.  We have a shed in our backyard we don’t use, and I want to tell him he is welcome to sleep there if he wants and we can unlock it for him.  I don’t know how to approach him.  He’s got a nice set up, but I never actually see him.  I don’t want to freak him out. 

Any advice on how to approach him in the most respectful manner?  He was so scared the only time I saw him, and I don’t want to like give him a heart attack by coming up while he’s sleeping.   Maybe I leave him a note and some hot hands?

ETA: All worked out well! I got a nasty cold the day after I posted this, and my boyfriend got sick as well.  About five days ago, my boyfriend was on the porch smoking and he and Marcus (our homeless neighbor) chatted.  Marcus apparently was sleeping in the abandoned house that caught on fire, and he lost everything he owned when it burnt down.  Boyfriend asked about the porch and told him we could unlock the shed if he needed; Marcus said that he appreciated that and he has a way inside the house next door if it gets cold, but he likes to sleep outside.  (I imagine I would too if all my shit went up in a house fire.). He’s now more open and doesn’t feel like he needs to hide from us which is cool.",2021-11-13 14:24:10,2021,11,13,14,24,10

qrap6z,173,commercialssuck1991,85,homeless,Homeless people are awful. And that’s coming from someone who is living in a shelter.,"Bad circumstances have led me to a side of living I never quite expected. I am now living in a shelter. 

The upside is that the facility and staff are wonderful. I have never met such a nice group of well-meaning and generous set of people in my life. The downside, without a doubt, is my fellow residents. These people are shockingly rude and ungrateful. You would think they would be humbled by their circumstances, but instead they endlessly complain and ask for more. The food is too cold. We don’t get enough premium cable channels. Cigarettes should be free. It never ends with these people. I am one of the few here who still owns a vehicle. They are utterly shocked that I am unwillingly to drive them all over town in exchange for Oreos and Potato Chips and the like. Oh and they love to steal at every opportunity that presents itself.

I cannot wait to be over this situation and these truly awful people.",2021-11-10 19:31:30,2021,11,10,19,31,30

I need to find a free tent, sleeping bag and whatever I can in terms of warm stuff. I pretty much only have my clothes from summer. I don't know what to do. I was doing great and about to get a job (well I had an interview) but since I'm having emergency dental procedure this week and won't be able to make it back in time to sleep for the night they are going to kick me out. I can't not get this done my tooth is fucked up and hurts and I may not ever get another chance to have not fixed for free? I'm freaking out. I don't even have bus money. Do you guys know any charity's that could help with warm stuff, tents and food?

Update: I'm getting kicked out of the shelter tonight if I don't get back in time. A doctor's not won't help I talked to the supervisor. I'm about to get on a couple busses I will be on them until my dentist appointment at 3 then having the procedure. I don't know what to do.

But I always like to plug this is I can - if you’re under 30 and can handle stressful jobs but don’t like Karen’s yelling at you, consider becoming an air traffic controller. The average starting pay is 127K and you don’t need a degree. It’s also a federal job, with federal benefits, and a union, and you’re legally required to retire at 56.

I also found this TikTok really informative. (saw it today and it reminded of how I wished I’d done it).

&#x200B;

It sounds crazy stressful but it’s because your literally making sure people don’t die instead of your work being crazy stressful because some asshole didn’t like how his grilled cheese was cooked and yelled at you to remake it twice.

&#x200B;

“But the cheese isn’t cooked enough in the middle! Oh, now it’s too cooked! You need to make another. I’ve been coming to this Grilled Cheese Factory for 10 years. I can’t believe I’m being treated like this.”

Sadly you do have to be under 30 (another TikTok by that same person explains why) but damn if you can, go for it because that money sounds awesome.

qht2tt,27,kiealock,45,homeless,I think I'm being taken advantage by a homeless person. Need some serious advice!,"I went to the store and this young lady asked for money. She said she aged out of the foster care system and was needing some money to get something to eat and for some personal hygiene items. I felt bad for her and gave her $60 out of my savings. Mind you, I only had $200 in my savings which took some time to save and had $30 separate for groceries to last for 2 weeks. Before I went to my car, I felt bad for her and I asked her could I pray for her. After we prayed she asked could she have my number. I was hesitant, but gave it anyway. Later that day she texted me and asked for $150 because some random lady offered her a room.  I wasn't sure how she would afford to keep paying for rent, but I remembered her saying she was looking for a job. I felt bad for her, and told her I would cashapp her $90 to add to the $60 I gave her earlier. She than texted back ""Okay great, idk how i'm going to find $150 next month for rent that's due on the ""11th,"" but God will work it out.""Next day she sent a cashapp request for $75 for groceries and than texted me after, that God had placed it on her heart to do so. I didn't respond that day, but the next day I felt bad for her and told her I could give her $20. This is what I felt comfortable giving her because I only had $50 left in my savings. She was still insisting that I give her $75 instead, and told me that she would no longer ask for money afterwards. I declined her request and told I could only give $20.  So I cashapp her $30 instead to cover the cashapp fees. She than texted me later that night and said she wanted to kill herself because the lady who offered her a room kicked her out because her child didn't feel comfortable with her staying in her house and she couldn't get her $150 back for the room. She said she called the cops but they sided with the house owner. I didn't know what to say so I didn't reply back. The next day she sent me a cashapp request for $80. I'm like okay, I feel bad for her, but she is starting to ask for money everyday now since I met her. I called her and told her I really can't help anymore, but she begged and said she was asking for $80 because she was trying to get her i.d to apply to jobs and was wanting to get a room. Knowing that her being able to get back on her feet, and get off the streets was more important than my needs. So I took $15 out of my groceries money and the last $20 out of my savings to cashapp her $35 for an i.d. I also offered to give her homeless shelter numbers and would call them if needed for her so she could have a place to stay. I felt kind of like an idiot because I only had $15 left for groceries to last me for 2 weeks and didn't have anymore money in my savings.**Her request for money didn't stop!** Today she texted me for $60 to get a room and sweared she would pay me back. I don't get it, I told her I don't have anymore money to help her with. I feel terrible for her, but she seems to completely ignore what I say to her......

qh3cg2,10,nightimefog,15,homeless,He was homeless.... now he’s using me?,"I met him in February on tinder. He was homeless, and trying to find his way after moving to LA with absolutely nothing to start turn his life around. From the hood in the Midwest, went to jail for a couple months, Found god and has changed. No doubt about this. He’s from the same place my family is from so I completely understand it, I have family members with similar stories....he didn’t tell me all this for awhile though- and eventually.... it basically turned into him living with me unofficially. He has money a lot of the time but nothing sustainable. Eventually we kinda got romantic, and it seemed very genuine. Hes bought me 2 outfits as gifts, he helps around the house, always helps me clean, buys me snacks, etc. It was consistent, and he gave me all his attention for a long time. We’re kinda best friends.....with benefits. But at the same time- I still have to pay for basically everything for him. he eats all my food if it’s something he likes- even if I tell him not to. So I have to hide it. I’m gone 13hrs most weekdays and I once caught him bringing his other (displaced) friend over even when I’ve asked him not to. (PTSD) I believe he has a room he’s renting a couple cities away but he’s stayed with me almost everyday since the beginning.

I went thru his phone bc he was being weird & found out his friend told him “he’s too comfortable and he needs to find new hoes because I’m just going to leave him for someone” so I realize he’s seeing another girl secretly as of this week and now he doesn’t even kiss me or hold me. I’m realizing I’m very unhappy because of him (I can’t go anywhere/do anything unless it involves him which also means I’d have to pay for him) so obviously, I’m feeling kinda taken advantage of. It’s obvious that using tinder was kinda his way of not sleeping on the streets, but we have history (fuck the romance, but he is ambitious, spiritual and is much like me in ways I’ve never seen, he tells me things he wouldn’t tell anyone else ) and I don’t want to have to be that person. Honestly if I cut him off, I know for a fact no one is going to deal with his BS like I would. (Not kidding) We always talk about loyalty being important in life and he has shown his when it’s really mattered to me. But I feel like if I want to grow, he’s gotta go and apart of me doesn’t wanna do that. What’s your take?",2021-10-27 12:35:45,2021,10,27,12,35,45

He did a good number on me....

I was weak and let him back into my life because I was scared of being homeless alone, and didn't have any money and he ""fed"" me.

He gave me two black eyes, and bruising all over my face and skull. All while I was sick with bronchitis in a tent in the middle of the woods.

He kept telling me, I'm gonna be making $600 this week I'm gonna save it and get us a place. 

But I never saw the money. Then he brought hard drugs around me which made me sick and scared.

I woke up in the middle of the night after he had assaulted me, and he was asleep, I snuck off and called 911 because my eardrum had been ruptured and it was giving me a lot of pain. The cops, after multiple reports finally believed me, and they've filed charges against him.

But he's not in jail yet. But I am somewhere safe.

I know there's a chunk of homeless people who are dealing with abuse, or controlling partners, or, partners holding them back. 

Stand up for yourself, RUN, and survive. There's so much more in life in store for you. 

I still have bad days, but, they are getting better knowing I can't be hurt anymore.

It's damn near impossible to find shelters like this one, but ease don't give up looking.  I'm from Florida, shelter name removed for safety purposes, they allow you to stay for 8-12 weeks, you get your own bed room, with a password lock, the property address is confidential and not listed on Google, and you get a case manager to help you along the way to recovery.

I've subscribed to this form for a few reasons, one of which is reminding myself to have gratitude and knowing that in retrospect my problems are not always big problems. That being said, this sub has taught me to be more compassionate towards people who are homeless. 

I have two questions actually, 

1. The people who beg / panhandlers by the freeway and streets (near red lights) are those good people, should I give them money? (I'm in California) I've been giving money to homeless people who are quiet, and keep to themselves, not actively begging, because I'm not sure if it's a business or they really need the cash. What are your thoughts on panhandlers?

2. Also I saw this on video, I thought it was neat and wanted to copy the idea. I wanted to buy 100 burgers/tacos from a local fast food place, and spend the day with my gf just handing them out to homeless people. Is this a good idea, will it make someone's day or make a difference? I want to be able to give what I can to make someone's day.

q52ndd,0,sk1mpyshrimpy,4,homeless,I used to be homeless.. And honestly I'd rather be.,"I used to be homeless with my fiance, most of it without a job until we moved in with his mother, then to my mothers. I had moved out of my mothers home right after I had turned 18 due to many reasons. She lived in a city with not many stores in walking distance. I had no car and no job at the time, any job i got i had to quit due to having to work fast food and she didnt like how I had to come home late most nights and I couldnt work earlier due to her not coming home yet from work so she can take me. My depression and anxiety got worse, I feared I would never get out and be able to make something of myself. I felt useless. So I contacted my friend, he had known of the way she would treat me, she would brush aside how I felt and made me feel as if i'm not doing my best when there was no way i could. Me and my friend arranged a day i would leave. I planned to leave before she got home one day and on a day my brother was at his fathers house. It was my only hope to get out of the cycle. I was too late. She got home before he had gotten there. She saw my things packed and told him when he pulled up ""she has an IEP! She cant leave me till shes 21!"" I then got scared. Losing all hope of having a chance. She was yelling and leaning into the window of his car ""if you take her i WILL call the police and tell them about her IEP"" I looked at him with tears and fear in my eyes, he asked her politely to remove herself from the window and she did. He then drove off. I started to panic. He said theres no such thing of having to stay with a parent till 21 if you have an IEP. I looked it up and it was true.. I didnt want to leave her that way. But the degration i wouldve gone through if i told her.. I didnt want to deal with. After a bit i had a job and was working a new one when his mother said ""if you lose this job soon you will have to leave."" I got a bit anxious but was confident i wouldnt lose the job. I loved this job and didnt see a panic attack happening at work like the last one did to make me lose it.. Sadly.. A panic attack did take my job away.. We were at a community college. I was fine until the point that i was left alone for a bit. I was confused as to way i was feeling so anxious, then looking at the people around me made it worse. I went to the bathroom in hopes of it going away. It didnt. I dont have panic attacks too often. But for some reason i did. And i didnt know it was panic attacks at the time so i was scared. I had scratched my hand trying to get myself to calm down so badly it made my hand raw. After it went down i felt dizzy. But my friends helped me bandage it up and took me to work. I was told i couldnt come back till it healed and to call when it did. I agreed since it was food i worked with and said id call on sunday. My wound got better, but when i called, i was told i was let off, after being told by my friend he thinks i did it for attention. I had to move out since i lost my job and after a while a friend let me stay with them. This was when the virus was first starting. For a few months i was there.. Until i met my fiance. After meeting up a few times i felt the need to go with him. So i did. We stayed in an abandoned house together until we moved in with his mother. I was so happy. His mother then started showing her true colors as well as his step father. I was woken one night by my face being poked real hard multiple times. I rarely cuss towards someone.. But this time i did. I said ""can you fu**ing stop?"" My fiance heard and long story short.. A fight happened. This led us to getting a tent and being homeless. Honestly... Thats the happiest i had ever been. We soon did move in with his mother again and after she had threated me multiple times for little to no reason with it all being voice recorded, we were forced to leave while they were asleep to my mothers house. I had forgotten why i had left in the first place but had a bad feeling about it. It was good at first. I had hope. But after a bit the manipulation, the degration and all started again. While we were on a trip i was dehydrated. She said ""if i have to take you to the hospital with everything going on im going to be pissed"" i then started to cry. I felt helpless. I couldnt fix the fact i was dehydrated. She then said ""oh dont start that shit"" and left the bathroom. I fell asleep crying that night with the realization of why i had first left.. Not to mention, being in my hometown wanted to make me leave more. Now were back and i want nothing more than to sell anything i dont need, and leave. I miss it all. Yes it was hard but it gave me more freedom and happiness than all of the other places i had been. Im so depressed right now.. I feel stuck again. I feel like the only thing i can do now is just sell what i can, make a plan and go. I feel my depression and anxiety eating at me more and more everyday. Especially when my mother starts fights out of nowhere from things that happen days ago. And especially when she does what she just did, my fiance was playing vr and she wrote on a note ""he looks ridiculous wtf"" and whispered to me ""hes a moron"" i was dumbstruck. I have to go. Now shes targeting him. I dont know what to do.",2021-10-10 00:31:33,2021,10,10,0,31,33

I live in my car, which is a huge upgradr from the last time I was homeless. But I have lasting anxiety and ptsd from my past. I was making my way down to Texas, and really pushing myself today on distance. I made it about 5 hours out from my destination and noticed I needed gas. 

I was in the middle of nowhere and it was getting dark FAST. (I have a really really bad time driving at night, my vision is terrible) my GPS brought me through a few towns that looked totally abandoned and broken down, and finally I came to the gas station my phone directed me too. The pumps were super old and I didn't understand how to use them, which made me feel suuuuper dumb. They also required Going inside to pay. 

Between that and the night completely blinding me I went into a massive panic attack. I have no idea where I am, and it's dark, and there's not alot of people around. 

When I went in I noticed the gambling machines  and got a few cups of instant noodles, my cat waiting impatiently for me to get back. I asked a few of the women in there if they knew of overnight parking and  they had no idea, like maybe a park near the lake or something. But it was so dark I could hardly see 5 ft infront of me even with my headlights (this small town had no streetlights) after paying for my snacks and gas I went out to go pump it, and simply couldn't figure out the way this pump worked, after about 2 minutes I gave up and went back inside to ask for help, my head hung low in shame. 

A dude who didn't work there came out to help me with it, I asked him if he knew any safe places for the night. He asked me how long I'd be there and I said just enough to get sleep (planning to leave around 5 am tomorrow to make sure I'm not a burden) He told me he lived across the street and as long as I was just catching a few hours of sleep I could stay in front of the store under his place. It's well lit and had cameras and would totally be safe. It's now almost midnight and I can say I feel safer than I did at random Walmart parking lots. 

It may not seem like a huge thing, but just being able to rest after 8 hours of driving and being both mentally and physically exhausted really made my night. So thank you mystery dude, you really saved my ass tonight. Even looking on the map this place isn't really near anywhere populated, and it's amazing to know that I have permission to park here and won't be woken up with a cop knock or some kid trying to break in. He didn't even judge me when he offered and it almost brought me to tears.",2021-10-02 23:00:02,2021,10,2,23,0,2

pwf9to,0,AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,17,homeless,How Does It Make You Feel To Understand That Your Very Presence Alone Anywhere Makes All Nearby Property Plummet In Value? Is this the Is This Ultimate In Dis-Affirmation and Shaming!,"Think about it for a second to feel just how powerful this statement is. You a homeless person. A person living with drug addiction, a prostitute trying to survive. An alcoholic drowning is sufferings. An ex convict society has thrown away. An out of work or under paid person drained of sufficient resources needed to remain housed. You all being homeless share one immense stigmatizing super power in the financially driven real estate marketplace.

You just by the act of being homeless anywhere alone but especially in mass reduce the value, quality of life and desirability of entire neighborhoods. Stigma's true destructive power is the effect it has on the selfish greedy fearful financial psychology better off people use to assign value to neighborhoods, housing and its inhabitants. The most hurtful stigma is that employed by the so called free market. Stigma against homeless people manifested in financial markets take the form of red-lining, property taxes that determine quality of support for school funding. A so called ""good neighborhood"" is the result of financial psychology exercised in the free markets poor people have almost no access to.

The capitalist free market corrects for social justice warrior diversity \\ inclusiveness initiatives using fiscal racism, homophobia, transphobia, anti homeless, slut shaming and other stigmas. The last festering bastion of oppressive stigma thrives within the very core of free market capitalism. Free markets governed by rich financial analyst's respond soon as a location in a former upscale area is ""zoned"" for public housing, a dope treatment center or a flop house. There is money in the churn from an area going from rich to poor or poor area to rich. The process of ghettofication starts before the first affordable housing brick is laid for poor tenants.

My concern runs deeper. How does it make you feel to be so hated that your very presence as homeless people whatever the cause is enough to make good people with great jobs and happy kids sell their homes and move away to avoid you. How does it make you feel to be chronically unwelcome. It's like having the superpower of making everything nice in an area rot and decay into gut wrenching poverty. The capitalist free market makes this process not only possible but extremely agile. The two economic processes both driven by stigma are Gentrification and Ghettotization.  The free market does not care because it makes money either way on what is called, ""The Churn."" When neighborhoods transition either way real estate and related consumer activities generate demand and fees. Homeless people are actually good for the economy because you keep well off people moving.

How do you all feel about being the Capitalist systems boogy men, fallen ladies and others?",2021-09-27 05:42:43,2021,9,27,5,42,43

- she looked up a counseling resource for me that could offer assistance and someone to talk to

- she tried calling 211 on my behalf; unfortunately she also got nowhere with them

- told me to apply to all the banks her friend is apart of (almost like a district manager)

- gave me her phone number in case anything happened or if I get an interview she could help me practice with her

- bought my mom and I lunch from panera 

- gave my mom a cane from the back (our main clientele is older and a lot of canes have been forgotten lol)

- essentially said I have to go to the offices in person and hire a disability lawyer due to the lack of responses we've gotten

- GAVE ME $300 CASH. I tried to refuse and give it back because holy shit that's a lot of money, but she insisted

- told coworkers about our situation. They are trying to gather money for us to help us get something and will also bring in food for us. They even offered to get us a microwave and hot plate if we stay in a hotel and don't have one

- coworker is offering us to stay with her for 30 days. She and her husband have a basement suite with a full kitchen and bathroom. There is one bedroom and she is willing to put a twin mattress in there for me. She and her husband want it in writing and it is only for the 30 days due to her family coming for the holidays, which is perfectly fine as I should have another job by then hopefully. 

Essentially my coworkers are amazing and I'm super thankful for all of them. My manager also said that she will give me more hours and I'm going to work tomorrow.

ps4fu6,117,AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,66,homeless,Is It Me Or Do Most Street Homeless People Look More Distressed & Sick Than They Used To 30 to 40 Years Ago?,"Ok I am an OLD man now approaching my mid 60's at high warp speed. I remember back in the 1980's \\ 1990's when homelessness exploded after Ronald Reagan cut the budget destroying the US health and welfare infrastructure. Back then I did not have a job because I was autistic still learning to be social enough to thrive in the workplace.

I used to volunteer helping the homeless full time in the 1980's so I saw homeless people everyday back then. Back then street homeless people weren't as dirty, did not smell as much and they weighed more in general. In the 1980's street homeless wore clothes you know were donated but they were clean. I used to meet street homeless guys in McDonalds every morning to take them to get ID or whatever else they needed. They might look rough but they looked presentable and were sort of happy even.

Please I am not putting ANYONE from today DOWN! I'm worried because, today I see so many street homeless today who just don't look as healthy, hopeful, well dressed, bathed and alert. It's almost as if society has become far more brutal to street homeless people. I am NOT blaming street homeless people I am blaming society. To put a finger on exactly what I think is different. In the 1980's street homeless people did not look so ABUSED by the society back then.

In the 1980's life on the streets was easier it seems and it shows in how people look. I just find it heart breaking that Street Homeless today looks much more painful, demeaning and lonely. If this is so what can we do to improve this. Back in the 1980's homeless people would talk to me and ask for help. Now it almost seems homeless people are afraid to engage housed people. I mean some homeless people will engage me but so many seem so broken inside. I was just wondering is it me or has their been a seed change in Street Homelessness that accounts for the pained states I see?",2021-09-20 15:37:09,2021,9,20,15,37,9
prowqv,2,AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,18,homeless,"""WE'RE ALL JUST ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS!"" is the dumbest statement I hear so often!","I feel the oversimplification in the ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" is the dumbest group of words ever spoken on the issue of homelessness. ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless unless we are NOT!"" Let's be real Jeff Bezo's is not one paycheck away from homelessness. Moreover relatively secure jobs do still exist in IT, medicine, engineering and other knowledge worker skilled labor type jobs.

""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" IF the WE in question have moderate to low skill jobs in fields where there is low to no demand and a glut of willing workers. If you are in a field  where workers are both needed and in short supply you can walk away from any job and find another. Pensions still exist for some older folk or again those whose skills are highly sought after.

Some people own their home and saved all their well paid working lives. Now in retirement they have money enough socked away to insure homelessness won't be a problem. There are so many instances where people go their entire lives without even a nodding acquaintance with street homelessness.

The ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" narrative does a utter disservice to homeless people because, it speaks only to the vulnerable precarious plight of the working poor and barely middle class worker. Yes people fall into homelessness from 6 and 7 figure careers. Yes it does happen but rarely. Lightening also strikes twice in the same spot if only rarely, but don't bet on it.

However the majority of passersby scurrying to their homes, workplaces, businesses or the mall will never experience street homelessness they ignore everyday. The ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" does not speak directly and convincingly to so many who will never live this experience. The people we must WAKE UP are those who are living in their bubbles of serene housed privilege NOT at GREAT RISK of ever becoming street homeless.

""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" lets stably housed classes of skilled knowledge workers, retirees and others off the hook in taking responsibility of caring for homeless neighbors. ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" gives those who are NOT one paycheck away from being homeless the rationale that lets them ignore street homeless suffering.

In my opinion ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" absolves stably housed upper middle class folks from caring about homeless people. I say don't care about homeless folk dying on the streets because of the lie that ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless."" NO! We ALL should care about the homeless dying on our streets because they are F\*\*KING HUMAN BEINGS who need your help and even more so if you are blessed to be so well off that being homeless is never likely to be your fate.

""To whom MUCH is given MUCH is expected."" is the saying I feel should totally replace ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless."" We should expect MUCH of those in power who control millions that could be used to end homelessness. We should expect MUCH of those whose jobs \\ careers, fiscal stability are such that a fall into street homelessness is all but impossible. We should expect MUCH of those who in retirement want for nothing. Simply we should expect MUCH from those who are NOT EVEN one or two or 10 or NO paychecks away from being homeless.""

I am so sick and tired of hearing fools sputter out ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" making it seem like we all have the same breaks in life. Yes for a great many ""WE ARE all just one paycheck away from being homeless!"" Yet for a MANY upper income folk MUCH IS GIVEN AND MUCH IS EXPECTED that has not materialized because we never call them out of their selfish privilege bubbles till now! If ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" we'd all have the same opportunities in life, the same financial situation, the same educational attainment, the same network of opportunities, the same empowering \\ enlightened upbringing, the same quality schooling, the same access to quality food, housing, utilities, internet and the same intrinsic skill sets, mental capacities and more. The myth that everyone in the US starts with the same advantages on a level playing field is A BIG FAT AUDACIOUS LIE! As my great grandmother used to say!

No the ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" is wrong because (adjusted for institutional economic racism.) most of those born to privilege keep privilege all their lives. Most people born to privilege have access to upper income social networks, contacts, opportunities and resources that people who truly are one paycheck away from being homeless will never have. ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" perpetuates the lie that we are all in this together.  Just like COVID19 you had people video chatting from fabulous homes with sub-zero fridges in the background saying we are all in this together. NO WE ARE NOT ALL IN THIS TOGETHER THAT IS A LIE!

Too many of us are dying on the streets just outside your gated communities. Too many of us and dying in hospitals of a deadly cocktail of COVID19, spent bodies and poverty. We are and were not in the COVID19 fight together any more than, ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless."" Stop repeating media spin lies that absolve the upper middle and upper classes who fight to keep you out of their neighborhoods and suffering on these streets. When you say ""We're all just one paycheck away from being homeless"" you are blaming the poor for circumstances not of their own making that they were powerless to avoid.",2021-09-20 00:09:38,2021,9,20,0,9,38

po9h2d,109,Psychological_Pea871,38,homeless,10 days as a homeless.,"It's been 10 days, 10 whole days, my god, I never thought i could survive like this for so long, and I know that there are people who are in this situation a lot longer, but, to me, this was inimaginable. It's like living in this twilight zone episode, everything looks like my former life, but it has a different tone, a different feel...one thing is for sure, i'll never be the same again!

 I had a few more copies of my résume made, I am applying for a job everywhere i can, I am not giving up, but lately my PTSD and depression are really flaring up. Had an anxiety attack last night and Paulo and Jorge called 190 because i honestly thought i was having a heart attack. One thing about me is that i haven't had alcohol in 3 years (not an addict, i just don't like being drunk) and I don't do unprescribed drugs, but the first assumption of the paramedics was that i was on crack or something like that, when i ensured them that I don't do drugs, only than they took me to the hospital.

So the ambulance came and took me to the emergency room of the local hospital, they gave me some iv thing that calmed me right out and i slept there for a few hours, but they had to let me go around 4am. I was feeling drowsy from the drugs and quite shitty with the way they treated me in the hospital, it was like i wasn't deserving of care... honestly, f\*ck them. 

Today was rainy all day long, heavy rain, so i couldn't play my guitar in the park, which means i couldn't make money. So I used some of whatever is left of my savings to buy me and my friend Jorge lunch at a cheap diner downtown and we're killing time here since noon watching the sports channel; he bought the coffee so we have an excuse to stay all day long inside and not be in the rain. 

The rain really ruined my schedule, i was planning on using the money i'd make in the park to pay for an AirBnb  tomorrow; gonna have to work twice as hard tomorrow if want to have any chance of having a nice night sleep before my job interview. All I can do is hope that it doesn't rain tomorrow.

I am not one to shy away from honest work so I really hope I get the job. I am really excited about this interview, wish me luck guys!!!

Today is being a good enough day, went to my spot at the park to play my guitar and try to get some money: very nice crowd today, made around 20R$. A very nice person helped me generously yesterday so I bought me and my buddy Jorge, who's also homeless, a full breakfast, It was even enough for me to buy a cheap pair of pants and a t-shirt to replace the clothes that got stolen yesterday. Let me tell you guys, not being hungry all the time really elevates the spirit, If i have food, i feel like I have time and strengh. My next goal will be to go to a motel or cheap hotel to take a shower before thursday and have at least one good night sleep.

I am at my usual coffee shop right now having a sandwitch and coffee, gonna kill some time here and charge my phone, the weitresses are very nice here, they let me stay even realizing me and my friend are homeless. 

I want to thank every kind word and gesture i've received thanks to this subreddit, there are honest, good people here and you guys keep me sane, really, without a doubt i would have lost it already if I didn't have you guys!

pmub8p,93,Psychological_Pea871,32,homeless,Got robbed and feel hopeless,"So, i've slept at my spot in the park, next to the security cabin, i felt relaxed and left my gym bag next to me without tieing it to my body. I slept using my backpak as a pillow, so at least they didn't take that, when i woke up, my gym bag was gone, the security guard who's actually friendly to me fell asleep during his shift and i guess that's when it happened. 

That sucks! Literally every peace of clothing i have that wasn't in my body was in there, plus a couple of rare books i sneaked out of my old apartment, my grandpas wrist watch and my old photo album. I know i shouldn't feel so bad about stuff that don't hold particular monetary value, bot those things ment a lot to me, those were memories of happier times and my grandpa's watch was the only thing i had left of him! He was the only person who ever really gave a crap about me and would have helped me if he saw me in this situation, now it's gone and there's nothing i can do. Police won't help me and people really don't care about homeless people here. 

I still have my backpack at least, i didn't loose my phone or my charger, I still have some copies of my résume with me, gonna hand them down later, i tried to make some money this morning playing guitar in the park, made about 6 bucks, enough to buy me a sandwich at least. 

I feel very bad, i feel defeated, cheated out of life, not gonna lie, not being suicidal is a struggle, my anxiety is at a peak and I see everyone as a potential attacker, i feel less than human and that I don't belong anywhere...I am not sleeping at that park again, i'll find a new spot, more secluded and safer, maybe the woods at the outskirts of the city. 

Tell you the truth, folks, i feel desperate now, wish i had the guts to jump from a bridge or something, just be done with it, but knowing I have your support gives me a little bit of strengh, i really could use advice right now on what to do next...i feel i'm doing everything i can and it's never enough.",2021-09-12 09:04:14,2021,9,12,9,4,14

pmm7c3,1,Useful_Refuse4662,29,homeless,"Does anyone have a ""tent life"" success story?","I've been homeless on and off for 2-4 years. I've tried it all. Sleeping on benches, shelters, sidewalks, docked yachts, and tents but it's always been pure hell.

Whether its the heat or the cold, or the security guards or having my camp destroyed/looted..it never works out. I always end up desperate, half crazy, and absolutely miserable.

 I live in Florida and in the Summer 90 degree mosquito filled nights are the worst. I'm in a pretty big city and there's tons of tweaker/crack head homeless who are always looking for their next score. As a result, finding a decent and quiet (undiscovered) patch of woods is almost impossible. Even if my gear doesn't get jacked, the police and their helicopters have nothing better to do than Kick me out. Literally every forest area I find has already been populated by generations of homeless and it seems impossible to find something safe and secure.

Found a prime piece of land directly across the street from a shopping mall and on the ocean. That was a dream, but there were 4-5 other people on the property and the cops tracked me down after a few months. After that I set up a tent behind walmart with a bunch of other folks and had my tent and gear looted daily.

Im in a position now where I'm making about $45k a year. That equals about $900/week but I'm stuck paying $1600/month for a 10×12 slum hotel room in a BAD area. This place is so tiny and old it only has 2 outlets and even my pet cat can't stand the lack of space. I could easily afford a luxury condo for the same price but theres no way for me to save the $3000-4000 deposit money and nobody is going to help me.

Every week I get a little closer to just pulling the trigger and buying a tent. Winter is coming soon and at least the bugs and heat wont be an issue. I have a cat so that is also a big concern..hes strictly indoors and is deadly afraid of the ""outside"" but maybe a big enough tent could fix that. I would hate to go to work and find him and the tent slashed up or gone..so location is key I guess.

ph2nzh,107,AUTISTICWEREWOLF2,49,homeless,IF YOU WERE STREET HOMELESS WOULD YOU RATHER SLEEP ON A CLOSET FLOOR THAN A SHELTER?,"Hello all. First thanks for being willing to put up with me and my responses. I know I am not the best person in the world. I am autistic and weird.

Ok that said. I live in a nice luxury place, very safe, air conditioned in Summer, Heated in Winter. Two bathrooms. Two bedrooms but I use one bedroom as an office since working from home due to COVID19. I have a friend who is street homeless. He too is autistic and hates shelters, the rules, the people, the touching, the noise, the drama. He has a secret sleeping spot but I know where it is.

I consider him more than an acquaintance but not quite a true friend. He is not a dope addict. He is an ex convict BUT over time I found he can be trusted not to steal from me or hurt me. He is not city slick he is more a country boy forced to come into the city for homeless support services. He lives in the county because he got hurt bad physically and mentally by bad people in the city.

I see him at the local library often trying to sleep and getting kicked out. I talked to him over coffee at the library. Yes our library is so posh it has a small Starbucks like coffee shop on the second level. We got to be sorta friends and on bad weather, super hot or cold days I let him sleep in one of my walk in closets.

Now my walk in closets are air conditioned in Summer \\ Heated in Winter. Roomy enough to stretch out on a wrestling mat. I provide him with clean bed clothes. I wash his clothing and keep all his personal items \\ stuff here so he does not have to walk the streets with it all in a pack back. Sometimes I feed him because I can afford it and he is good company.

My problem is I feel bad letting him sleep on a mat on my walk in closet floor by day. I put him out on the streets by night since, I'm gone to stay with my big fat autistic brother at night. On the other hand he looks so much better now that he gets a solid 10 hours of sleep and fed twice a day by me. The poor dear heart sells his blood and wants to use the proceeds to pay me rent for my walk in closet floor space. I won't charge him rent or take money that's ridiculous. My question stems from the fact he is so happy he almost vibrates when he lays down for the day.

He swears to me that laying in my walk in closet all day is the best thing ever. He says to use his wording, ""I know personally about 12 homeless guys that would give their left nut for this setup!""

Finally my question... IS HE LYING TO ME about sleeping on my walk in closet being so good and most homeless folk would love the arrangement I just explained above. I can't imagine being so tired and hurt street homeless that a red wrestling mat in a climate controlled walk in closet is like Winning the Lottery again his words.

I've got a huge blister on the side of my big toe. I'm sunburned to all hell.

I'm sitting outside if a McDonald's where the employees are arguing.

I didn't sleep last night. I sat behind a racetrac all night....

I'm scared. 

My boyfriend of 2 years has abused me...gas lighted me, made me lose everything.

I had a job and was living with him. He started off verbal...turned physical.

I've had my jaw fractured twice. A broken toe that calcified and doesn't bend anymore. Black eyes. A ruptured ear drum....

I'm no longer the same person I was before I met him. I haven't had a job in a year. He never let me leave the house.


I haven't had a phone in 6 months. I bought a phone from the dollar store but I couldn't afford service. 

He hacked into my account. Locked my PayPal. My Venmo. My chime. All I have left is cashapp.

I have been secretly selling nudes on the side and he found out...it was the final blow.

He kicked me in the face. He threw away everything I owned.

I called the cops. They didn't arrest him.

I ran. I ran. And I ran. I don't know where I am. 

I don't feel safe. The only shelter near by was full. 

There's no busses out here. 

I only have the clothes on my back and this tracphone with no service.

My skin hurts so bad.

I want to sleep. I want to lay down. I want to feel safe.


What do I do???? 

I can't get a taxi because I don't have any money.

I can't get an Uber because I don't have a phone number.

I can't get a hotel because he threw away my ID.

I can't buy a tent. Food. Or aloe for my sunburn.

I'm so lost.

I have no direction.

I feel sick. I have no family around. Parents are out of state and old and can barely support themselves.

My boyfriend took me away from the only friends I had around. I don't know if they blocked me because of him or....I don't know.

I need advice. Which way do I go? I can barely walk. I'm about to pop this blister.

p6khkz,99,130UniMaron0,18,homeless,"The shelter I live in went from tolerable to unsustainable in only 3 months. As usual, staff doesn't care.","I've been living in a homeless shelter for young people for 9 months. When I first got here, this was a decent place by shelter standards. Sure there were some people who were on drugs, the area outside was dangerous, half of the shelter was designated for older residents who were mostly trouble makers and weren't the most pleasant people to have to share a gated complex with. But the majority of people living in my building were average people, nobody stole, we had functional showers and laundry facilities, the building was clean, living conditions were tolerable. I used my time here to get mental health treatment, get a job, and get a section 8 voucher. I'm in the process of finding an apartment now.


However this shelter has completely gone to shit, all in a matter of months. When all of the staff quit in May and the executive director changed, I knew we were in for some bad shit. But I did not imagine such rapid deterioration. This week we made local news for having the largest Covid-19 outbreak in the city, but this is only the tip of the iceberg of the disastrous mismanagement going on behind these barbed wire gates. All of our living facilities are in disrepair. My building has rats. There are fights every single day. The food is not edible. Staff stands there and does nothing. Why are they even here? Aren't they getting paid to maintain this place? 


The last straw for me was when 2 meth addicts who are living in my building conspired to smuggle a gun in from some outside location and shoot the place up. They didn't know I could hear them. I've overheard these 2 say a lot of nasty shit, ok. I hear them talking about drug deals, prostitution, stealing from other residents, threatening to stab or jump or pepper spray other residents, they are both absolute garbage human beings. One of them has been here longer than I have, she has no job, no income, no plans to move out, she sits around and smokes meth all day. She is literally the poster child of ""bad homeless person"" the media loves to portray us all as. I have ignored both of them for months and months on end, never talked to anybody or gotten involved with anybody. But when I heard them say they had a gun and intended on shooting and killing people (btw security does not check our bags and we have no metal detectors at the gate) I recorded them and showed the recording to the staff. The staff did not take it seriously so I made a police report. The police said they can't do anything and these 2 pieces of shit are still living in there. The last contact staff made with me they tried to tell me I was the one in the wrong for recording them making terroristic threats because it was ""a private conversation"" and that I was ""slandering their names."" 


In what fucking world does that make any sense? How do you look at 2 drug addicts who contribute NOTHING to society, constantly steal and fight, and prioritize them over someone who has a job, has used the program to stabilize, move on to independent living, never gotten in a fight or had a single complaint filed against them? I can leave, rent a hostel while I transition to an apartment, it's nothing but a pain in the ass to me but not life ruining. However it pisses me off that this is the way this multi billion dollar system is being ran. Prioritizing and enabling shitty people with no future over people who have a chance at actually benefiting from that funding. 


What goes through the minds of these social workers when they make these decisions? They are all young, upper class, left leaning millenials. They aren't crazy, they seem like rational people from an outside perspective, they're educated. How do they rationalize the way they are running this place? Do they think they're doing the right thing, do they even care at all? 


Maybe I'm just yelling into the void here, I'm sure I'm not the only person who lived this experience. But I have to get it out to somebody. It's like I'm being made to feel like I'M the crazy one here.",2021-08-17 22:58:46,2021,8,17,22,58,46

I recently came to the conclusion that I want to write a fictional novel about someone who falls out of society and eventually becomes homeless. They then progressively go through a self-journey that leads to them visiting their parents for the first time in years. 

I have multiple people who I hold dear to my heart that have battled the drivers of homelessness, and I have flirted with it myself in the past. it is an issue that I wish to leave some sort of positive impact on through my life's work, which involves a love for writing and my pursuit of a Master's degree in Urban Geography/Planning. 

In order for the novel to be as close to the truth as I can make it, and to convey the messages in the most realistic way possible, I require more knowledge - more experiences outside of my limited scope of the world.

Tell me about the crazy (or beautiful) things that have happened to you on the streets, but please, keep it real - for the simple integrity of literature.

ojky51,20,HomelessOnReddit,19,homeless,hot take from r/denver - thoughts?,"there will be no ""eradicating the homeless"". It is also an impossible goal to ""just house them"".

I've worked in a homeless shelter, and within the jail system. When I tell you a LARGE chunk of the homeless don't want responsibility, I am not talking out of my ass.

The working homeless- ya know, the ones that actually want to get out of homelessness...you don't see them..and why is that? Because they are in the shelters, taking advantage of programs to get out of their situation. They are at work DURING THE DAY, not on the street. They are participating in care plans with a human services worker, they are not the ones begging for money, or stealing your bike.

The severely mentally ill, and drug addicted homeless are the ones camping, taking up sidewalks, using needles, defecating on the streets and harassing you all. I have worked with both types of homeless people. One WANTS the responsibility of paying bills and living a pro social life, the other one doesn't. I have worked and worked and busted my ass to get some of these guys on the streets, real housing vouchers. Not the temp hotel vouchers, I mean the vouchers from Salvation Army, MDHI, Denver Rescue Mission. Vouchers that give them the golden ticket to a furnished place to live, and the ONLY caveat is that they participate in treatment and case management. I have also offered some greyhound tickets back to their home state.

Off my memory I can think of 15 vouchers I recieved to hand out to clients during my time working with the homeless. Want to know how many of them took their housing voucher when I let them know the exciting news? Two, just two. One guy even admitted he had no plans to get better because he made ""too much from panhandling"" The guy would come back to the shelter with tons of junk food and hundreds of dollars and flaunt it to the rest of the guests staying there.

I hate to even say this, but the sweeps are necessary. You could hand some of these people their way out of homelessness and the thought of being responsible will make them decline the offer. It's all about self determination. I can't force them to be pro social, no one can. You can only hope that they hit rock bottom and get so tired of moving place to place that they either cave and get help, or relocate to a state that doesn't shuffle them around.",2021-07-13 11:52:58,2021,7,13,11,52,58

A friend from a Discord server we were both once members of recognized my username and hit me up in the ingame chat. We hopped into a Discord call, got to catching up, and I was blunt and honest about my current situation. He immediately offered a room in his house, and has been letting me stay here rent free so I can get back on my feet.

Mostly wanted to make this post to highlight the positive side of social gaming/online friendships. I had never even seen this guy's face before he picked me up at the airport. (We had interacted for countless hours over voice chat though, so it wasn't like I had no sense of what kind of person he was before I accepted his offer).

For various logistical reasons, I expect I'll be moving on from here within the coming months, but until I have that next phase of my journey planned out, I've got a safe and comfortable place to live that doesn't enforce a curfew, forbid the carrying of sharp tools, or have more than one bed per room.",2021-06-21 15:29:40,2021,6,21,15,29,40

I don't think he realises how much it meant to me, as I had little money at the time, with no income, and finding food ended up being an almost daily struggle. 


Now, I'm no longer homeless. In September I moved into a permanent shared home for people in similar situations to me. Today I met up with my brother, for the first time in a long time, and he got us lunch again. It brought me so much joy to see him again, and to know he will always be there for me, whether I'm homeless or not, hungry or not. 


I hope this is okay to post. I just wanted to remind people that things can get better. I know I'm very privileged to have been able to get a home and have my brother by my side, especially since so many don't have this.

Had Uber pick me up at 6am and was on greyhound at 9am.
Well, I noticed the next day, the hotel charged me at 1 pm. By that time, I was in another state 

I called and the day Manager says she has proof I was there. WTF! I asked ""what proof?"" Click. Hung up on me.

Guys I feel like I was robbed. It's infuriating. I'm about to call my bank, but this seems criminal. I never signed for a charge either.

Also, called their corporate to complain. Was told I would get a call back. Never did.

Any options? Also, be wary of hotels. Some of em are sleazy. I had one a yr ago charge me a 25 deposit and when I checked out, was advised I would get it back. Never did.

Edit: Thanks for the award thingy. Just was letting y'all know that be aware of motel fees, overcharges.
I called my bank and they are  investigating my claim. Also, read bad reviews of the hotels before staying so you get an idea of the place.

nlqlcs,79,JoeRMD77,23,homeless,Me being me...,"I've been living up inside of my my cramped Ford Focus for around ten days now. After ditching the shelter, I balled out on DoorDash and made just under a grand for the week compared to the week before at $600. Was able to put most of it away and been looking at rooms to rent.

Checked out a few rooms that people are renting out from their homes, but I'm not sure yet. I got a few barriers until I'll be able to get an apartment, but it's doable. The people who rent rooms around here have all been nice so far but I'm down to continue roughing it until something suitable arises.

A job at this grocery store warehouse was supposed to start tomorrow, but then the HR people called and pushed it back for no reason. I was ready to spend time working, but now I gotta wait. 

So, like old me, I went and grabbed a joint from the dispensary. 

The last time I got high, it was from vaping and it really made me freak out. It was a case of taking ""too much"" and the head high with vaping was like that old commercial where the guy goes ""here's your brain - here's your brain on drugs"" as eggs crackle and sizzle on an all-too-hot frying pan. I was having bad paranoia and also feelings of despair.

However, after smoking this joint (in place of vaping): I feel good, man. I grabbed a chicken sandwich from McDonald's, which tasted more like a sponge than anything noticeable to my pallette, in an attempt to cut my buzz down because being too high and trying to work delivery don't my mix. 

Hit the library next to take a three hour break so I'm not out there on the road all lit up.

I know it wasn't the most genius of me to partake, but that's what I did in the face of stress with the job getting pushed back. I have very real triggers that I have to work on.

I don't think I can chase the magical dragon daily anymore. But damn if I get too stressed: anything could happen.

I'm ready to hit the road again for work and then rest at the Walmart parking-lot afterward. I'll do better tomorrow.",2021-05-26 14:24:41,2021,5,26,14,24,41

I was homeless for almost 2 years back in 2014 and have since opened a garage and became a notary public. 

While homeless i realized how much help was just not there for people in rough situations and the help that was there if any was just a pain in the ass to get.

I plan on opening a store front with a recycling center in the back and my wife and i will only be hiring homeless to get tham back on their feet. 

We plan to offer financial education and budgeting as well as a job and a place to eat shower and job hunt. We cant offer shelter due to insurance purposes but we are trying to find a work around on that. 

When i was homeless the only way i got back on my feet was i went to a local church and asked if i could use their shower and clean up in order to go and look for work and to be presentable. In return i offered to clean and maintain the church and its property lawn mowing, building repairs ect. They agreed and i was back on my feet about a month later. 

Now i want to do the same but the town ship offers no help due to the fact it doesn't benefit them. 

We have a go fund me with a little more info on our plan we havent really put it out their much but there really seems to be no one that is willing to support the idea. 

Long story short one way or another my wife and i plan on making this work and if you are homeless in the NEPA (North Eastern Pennsylvania Area) and would like to work with us on this project please let us know we are going around to different programs and charities to see what we can do to get everything going before the next cold season hits. 

Let me know how you all feel about this idea and if you have any suggestions on how we might be able to find the funding or resources to make it possible.

I myself am not currently homeless(been close before)... I enjoy exploring abandoned spaces and there is a boarded up, burnt out home in my neighborhood. So I found a way in and did some exploring. The ground floor is trashed... Made my way upstairs and, in the farthest corner of the house, came upon what was clearly someone's spot - blankets, shoes, clothes, etc. 

I'm afraid that my disturbance of their spot will freak them out, if not cause them to leave an otherwise safe space.... Is there anything I can do to let them know I'm not a threat?

Secondly, if I wanted to help them in some way, any suggestions? Would leaving a note in the house(where they would see it but not on the outside where anyone could) be too weird?

Shortly after, the roofing company came and started on the roof, but made some kind of mistake and now petroleum gas has filled our house and is completely toxic, we can't sleep there or even step foot inside without feeling our chests tighten and our eyes watering. We tried to get the roofers to help us but they refuse and are only now demanding the money we owe them for DESTROYING our house...

So come 2 weeks later, we call and company to come clean our house, they claim to be able to remove ""biohazard level chemicals"" so we pay them everything we have left and they get to work, we get super hopeful that we will be in our house again soon. But, it didn't turn out that way.

The cleaning company only made the situation worse, see instead of removing the chemicals from the house, they just masked it with a deoderizing lemony chemical that ended up mixing with the petroleum gas, thus the house is even MORE toxic. So we begged and begged for then to fix it and they refuse, saying they have done ""all they can"" but we are still without a home now two months later. We are living out of trash bags and I feel helpless.

We tried to ask our insurance to help, said they couldn't pay for it since it's a ""third party issue"", we tried contacting a lawyer which we may pursue legal action, but here's the problem were running out of money, we have nowhere to stay, I don't even care about how much it costs anymore, I just want my home back.

n0i0cu,4,yuumicuteee,2,homeless,Me (25M) and my fiancée (23F) become homeless next week. No government help (Germany).,"Im gonna keep it very short otherwise i have to write a book.
I have no parents and no family and not really friends.
I have a mental health disorder (strong generalized anxiety disirder, adhd and ptsd).

My fiancée grew up with a clinical psychopath as a father who after 8 years of us together ""finally"" cut her off and put her on the streets.
With cutoff I mean left to die.
She was/ is heavily manipulated from him so she can’t defend herself in any situation, it’s getting a little bit better tho when she finally cut him off and realize how much of a tyrant he is.

I can’t work and don’t get government help (I had it for 3 years).

Her father did some traumatizing things, very illegal ones...can’t really talk about it. But we got tortured for 2 months.

We cut off every connection with her family (very small family, everybody ""escaped"" the psychopath). She still has a good relationship with her mother but she is on the edge of being homeless aswell.

After the terrific and traumatic actions her father did she went into a psychward so she can get government help first and then therapy. Problem is, nothing is coming through because her father is all lawyerd up. We went to the police multiple times, many courts etc. 
but he’s a **very very very rich motherfucker.**

-We got no government help (we went to ALL places that could help, no help)

-We don’t have any food and steal/eat rest overs from the local hospital 

-we will end up in big debt because we weren’t insurancesd

-I am sadly dependent on medication, not taking it could kill me 

-our mental health is very very very bad 

-it’s logical seen senseless and there is actual no hope. We are aware of this situation for a longer time now and tried everything.
It’s all lawyerd up, no chances

-if we don’t get food/ money/ medication soon we are forced into illegal stuff, we really really don’t want to. But if we are starving we will go hunt and steal


Since we don’t want to give up on life our plan is to go into the woods. When I was around 20 i did a lot of survival stuff and i also grew up in the most criminal town in germany. A switch between the Forrest and city..

What should we taking care for? I know what to have in our backpacks and i can hunt and defend ourselves. We need to get away from her father because of the abuse and crimes he’s doing...new names would really help.

So we’re heading into the woods very soon but we sadly have to leave our beloved cat behind (my fiancée mother will take care of her).

We don’t want to be spotted, we need to disappear otherwise her father will do crimes again. We’re gonna try it one more time with police and court, if it doesn’t work we are heading into freedom, even if it’s uncomfy.

I also have a question for people from Germany/ Europe. Is there a nearby land where we could start a new life easier, where her father can’t do anything and the government is not as ""bürokratisch"" as in Germany?

At least we are together

1. Actively addicted/using any drugs. Do not even bother if you're using drugs. Marijuana included.

2. Recent DUIs(last 5 years)

3. Reckless driving convictions.

As far as other felonies, most won't matter. I have a friend that did 17 years for attempted murder and he got a job right out of CDL school.

I wasn't homeless when I got my CDL, I was in section 8 housing at the time. I was unemployed, so I went to my unemployment office and applied for what is called the WIOA grant. A few hoops to jump through but it was pretty easy. They paid $5000 for my CDL school.  This is the best option because you're not beholden to a company for a year or whatever.

The easiest way to get your CDL is to call up a company like Prime, Swift, Knight, CR England, Roehl, CRST etc. Apply for their CDL schools. You end up with a job right out of school, most of them pay you whole you're in school too. 

School is usually 3-4 weeks long, and on the job training is another 3 to 6 weeks. But you're getting paid for all of that. I got paid $800 per week to train at my current company. 

The starter companies that help you get your CDL don't pay very well, 500-800 per week is common, but after 6 months to a year your job options open up. I'm almost 8 months in, once I hit my year of experience I'm moving to a company that will pay about 30 percent more than I'm making right now. So I'll be making 7k to 8 k per month, after taxes.


This is a good job, and as someone that was homeless for so long, lacks social skills, dislikes most people in general, this job is perfect for me. I wish I did it years ago.",2021-04-26 10:53:04,2021,4,26,10,53,4

mtllhf,1,Markdd8,5,homeless,"Will full acceptance of marijuana use, legalization, contribute to homelessness?","*Hope we can have a reasonable discussion on all this:*

Article: [Does Recreational Marijuana Legalization Contribute to Homelessness?](https://reason.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/homelessness-effect-of-marijuana.pdf)  This writing offers calm, nuanced conclusions.  Excerpts:

>While there is evidence that homelessness has increased in states that have legalized marijuana, it is not clear that this is primarily the result of legalization. Data from the two states to first implement legalized recreational marijuana use— Washington (2013) and Colorado (2014)—suggest that homeless rates increased dramatically following legalization...

>Plausibly, some of the rise in homelessness in Washington and Colorado has been an indirect consequence of legalization of marijuana, which has contributed to robust economic growth and in-migration. Anecdotally, homeless shelter managers report that some homeless persons from out of state indicate they have migrated to work in the marijuana industry—a cohort casually known as “trimmigrants.”

>Islands of recreational marijuana legalization, such as Colorado, Washington and Oregon are likely to experience initial higher in-migration due to job opportunities caused by booming economies. High migration increases demand for limited supplies of housing, which results in higher home prices, pricing some out of the market and into homelessness. 

- - - -

Reasonable conclusions.  But pursuing the topic further, might we conclude there is more of a *Yes* answer? A homeless crises  results from two things: 1) People falling into homelessness and 2) Homeless being unable to climb out of their condition.

We know that marijuana is minimally debilitating to users.  It would be extreme to suggest marijuana use ever caused someone to fall into homelessness.  But what about people who *are already homeless* from the conventional reasons:  hard drugs and alcohol, mental issues, and economic hardship?  

And some are smoking weed every day, much of the day. No surprise people are doing this: Marijuana is accorded a long list of benefits: helps with anxiety and PTSD, benefits people with depression, relieves chronic pain, and is seen as a safer alternative to opioids. [link](https://www.health.com/condition/pain/marijuana-benefits-risks) 

Is daily smoking going to help homeless develop a mindset to try to get their life in order, find work and housing?   Or does daily marijuana smoking for some people just continue the status quo, which in some cases is *a cruising lifestyle?*  (This procrastination can apply to housed unemployed persons also.)

mq0vt5,91,_ism_,74,homeless,Formerly homeless. I'm not doing well in housing. I don't know what else to post this,"I've been housed by an agency in a nice apartment for about six months. It has helped with some aspects of my addiction recovery and mental health. I have maintained sobriety for two years. I have a caseworker visiting once a week. I have an emotional support cat. And I have the internet. This is pretty much everything I have in my life right now and I just feel so empty.

I'm an advocate for housing first and I understand that it is a necessary step to start addressing many of the other underlying issues that I was struggling with and that contributed to my homelessness. But I'm realizing now that it's just the beginning and I am still just an absolute mess of a person unfit to be in society. I was naive to think that housing would fix everything. I don't know where to go from here. My caseworker make sure that my Medicaid is up-to-date and helps me schedule appointments and things but because of covid my access to Mental Health Care has been severely limited. Support groups are not meeting. My therapist has such a huge case load and so do all the other therapies at the agency that we can barely get an appointment once a month and that's only over the phone they don't even do Zoom.

Oh yeah here I am and I've been the house for six months and you would think it would be great. But all of the old symptoms from before I was homeless and before I was addicted are coming back. During my addiction and homelessness I was in survival mode. I was having extreme social anxiety and regular general anxiety and panic attacks and PTSD episodes all the time. Now in the apartment I have not had a panic attack or a PTSD episode more than once in this whole six months. I used to have them almost everyday out on the street. The only time I had one in the apartment was when my ex-boyfriend was here abusing me. But my case worker helped me go no contact with him.

So there was a lot good going on. The abuser is out of my life. Legal action has been taken against him. I got a new car. I have a house. I haven't done any mess in 2 years. I quit smoking cigarettes a month ago my case worker say I am their best case and I am the easiest client and the most independent but I really feel like I'm just about to crash and burn again. I feel this massive anxiety that something is going to go wrong. And everyday I have nothing in my life. All of my street friends are toxic and I just can't be around them without having panic attacks. And I don't have the money to join real Society to do things like go to clubs and restaurants to meet real people. So I'm just here on the internet and I'm finding that now instead of panic attacks I'm just so sad and so broken. Even the tiniest little internet comment can put me in tears. So I'm feeling extremely sad and rejected all the time based on every time I reach out through social context. One half of it is just rude people on Reddit. I'm in tears even trying to write about it. What is wrong with me. My life is great and paid for it. I am totally taken care of. But I am so sad. I almost want to go back to anxiety and PTSD episodes because at least somebody sometimes it would stop if they saw me having an episode on the street they would ask if I was okay and I don't have that now. Or even if somebody was mean to me because I was having an episode on the street somebody else would yell at the person being mean to me it made me feel like a human being sometimes and now I just kind of feel invisible. I survived on the street and now I am wrecked by internet comment? I just want to say that housing first isn't the only solution. I don't know what kind of help I need but just because I'm in a house and off drugs doesn't mean I'm in a good place to rejoin Society. I feel completely unfit to join Society I'm actually kind of afraid to go out of the house because any time I run into any conflict whatsoever I just break down into a panic PTSD puddle. And then I get accused of relapsing when it's really just a panic attack and so I would rather not interact with people based on everything but they keep telling me to go out and join society and be more social and it just terrifies me. The kinds of things I would be interested in doing socially like I did back when I used to be a normal person are no longer available because of social distancing. There is Community Theater and I thought about joining that but they have kids and I really don't want to be around children because I have had children's parents take their children away from me because I was having a panic attack saying that I am an unsafe person and I just don't want to expose myself to those innocent people. I just don't feel fit to join Society anymore even though I've mean taken care of it's like it's almost like I've been put out of sight so that nobody has to deal with me I've never felt like a real human being ever since being homeless. I'm housing I still feel like this trash",2021-04-13 06:07:13,2021,4,13,6,7,13

I hope you are all doing well. This past year has been the hardest on the people who already had the odds stacked against them.

My business associate recently cut off his kid who is 19 and I drove around for 3 hours until I found and brought him to my home from a homeless shelter. He had been robbed, was sleep and food deprived, and was in mental distress.

That was only 4 months. 

My dad kicked me out when I was 16 and told me to go die in a ditch. It took me 15 years to pull myself out of that hole and retire, but I never forgot the feeling of being abandoned like that.

Please love your children and don't give up because you are unable to parent them right. The damage you will cause by handing them over to the unforgiving hands of the streets is permanent.

I hope that people who force humans to come into this world and decide to give up are forced to be homeless for eternity after they die.

Title says it all summed up but heres a rundown.

I was my moms caregiver (main job) for years since I was a teen, until she passed December 18th 2020. Two weeks after my moms death my grandparents suddenly cut off all money. I could no longer afford food or my meds.
By January 31st I was homeless. I got kicked out by my grandparents who own the house. They only gave me a week to figure out what to do but still forced me out. 

In February I thought I had found a friend of mine who was going to help me, but they decided to use up my cash, my ebt, knock me up, and dip. Leaving me alone again.

Its now April, I still cannot find a job. I have filed 200 applications in the past week alone. 90% of them are scams, and the others are just no call backs. From fastfood to freelancing. I’ve even had to suck dick for $20 to $30 to just have gas to stay warm at night. I don’t have enough money for the dmv to get a license or register my car. So every time I drive Im stressed out that I’ll lose everything again. I’ve exhausted my options from shelters to hotels to friends and family. Nobody can take me in or help me. I’m on my own, and terrified.

I have BP, BPD, PTSD, and Panic Disorder.
Sometimes I cant even go to the bathrooms across town because driving, and going in public gives me severe panic attacks I nearly pass out (my vision gets fuzzy and white). Imagine trying to drive during that? Not only is it terrifying but dangerous. I’ve had several bathroom accidents because there’s no way I can make it or have a place to go. I’ve been to the ER more times than I can count because of my disorders, but now being homeless has made it worse. 

I can’t even afford my bipolar meds (can I even take them while pregnant?) and I’ve called all the mental help places. They either won’t take my insurance, or they are booked till the fall. I even filed in January for disability but its going to be another month before they can even LOOK at it to try and push it through just to ATTEMPT to approve it.. God knows that will take even longer..

I’m going to either die in my car, because I cant function enough to survive. Or I kill myself because there’s no way out of this.

I’m so desperate for money, I’ve done sex work. Freelancing office work and writing. But its so far and few between, $20 here or $50 there doesn’t do much. Especially trying to find a small shitty place just to sleep at night. 

I’m at my lowest with no way up. Im exhausted and scared. Alone. I’ve tried to be good my whole life, I don’t drink or do drugs or fight with anyone. All I’ve ever done is help people and just try and live through my disorders. 

What can I even do anymore? Am I doomed..?",2021-04-05 11:52:21,2021,4,5,11,52,21

I'm a university student currently doing research into what it takes for a homeless person to survive. I was hoping I could ask the awesome people of this community some questions to help with my study:

1. If a person was living wild (e.g. living in a tent), how much money would someone need per day to sustain their lifestyle? I know that this will depend on alot of personal factors, but if anyone could provide their opinions and experience, it would be much appreciated.
2. How does or can someone gain this level of income without a normalish job or government assistance? Is it normal to rely on handouts (i.e. busking, donations, etc?)  or do you guys and girls have other ingenious sources of income?

I know these seem like weird questions, but all data I can find is from those that are forced into bad situations, not those that choose the lifestyle for other reasons. So I'm more focused on a lifestyle sustainment income, rather than how much to change lifestyles. But in saying that, I'd love to hear anyones experience on the matter.

5 minutes ago..

Just waiting at the bus station. (Bus pass is $2) and a homless guy asked if I wanted to buy his because he said he was done with it for the day..I was skeptical but I figured ""yeah, why not? Rather give this guy money than the bus company.""

So I bought the pass and I happened to have a pizza I just picked up from dominos. So he said ""oh, you got pizza? Can I get some?"" I said yeah..take a couple of slices.""

He looked at the pizza (bacon/pineapple) and said ""I can't eat that shit"" and he walks away.

Here's the kicker..go to swipe the bus pass and its expired. He had rubbed out the ink so I couldn't see the date and driver said it was 2 days old. 

I mean, I can't be mad. I understand the desperation and the need..but I don't like the games these folks play. I'm homless myself and don't have much money. $2 isn't going to kill me, but there's a lot of stuff I need that I could use that for. Just sucks. Next time a legitimate person who needs the money is dealing with me, im gonna be twice as skeptical because you just can't trust people..",2021-03-18 17:17:02,2021,3,18,17,17,2

m3z49j,2,AnxietyFunTime,14,homeless,Boomers panhandling?,"Ok y’all I’m not homeless but I’ve noticed an increased number of boomers panhandling and I dunno if they’re destitute due to medical costs, lost job due to covid, or if it’s just an overall sign of the times. I’ve given money to two boomers this past week. I could tell they were completely harmless and just in a bad spot. I’m quite good at reading people. Of course, I’ve also had the drug addicted panhandler pop up on me at the gas station and I’ll give them pocket change just to go away, if I give them anything at all. I try to make sure I’m very cognizant of my surroundings- my high school boyfriend got stabbed in the back twice at a gas station about a decade ago. Scary stuff. But I’m also a very empathetic person. I have severe ulcerative colitis so I know what it is to be defeated and to lose your dignity and have your morale shattered, albeit in a lesser way. 

Anyway, about 4 days ago I went to the mall out of town and an older black lady popped up on me. I could tell she was just down on her luck. She said ‘you are the first one that’s smiled at me today. Thank god you aren’t prejudiced.’ That really hit me cause it must have been at least 4 in the afternoon.... to be destitute and not even receive so much as a smile most of the day has got to be harsh. I gave her a few dollars and asked her her name, where she was from, etc. She’s 60 years old with grandchildren. She reached out and touched my arm and said ‘I just have to make sure you’re real, and you really are in the flesh.’ I understand 99% of people may have recoiled but I just knew I was safe in her presence.

Today there was a couple in my hometown panhandling and they also appeared to be boomers. We don’t get panhandlers in my town often because people here either have no money or what little they do have, they don’t want to give it away. Lady was in a wheelchair holding a sign saying something about lupus and cancer, please help. Dude was with her holding a garbage bag of I guess their remaining items. I was on my way out and couldn’t talk but just gave them a few dollars instead.

I got back to thinking about going to the mall out of town Monday and honestly there were panhandlers all over the place, in most all parts of the town. Some were generation X but it seems like a majority were boomers. My boomer parents contracted covid months ago and my dad got laid off but I think they will be okay. I’m thousands of dollars in medical debt but I work and am getting an advanced degree so when I compare my problems to the panhandlers, my problems seem so insignificant. I wish I could do more to help out. 

Just curious if any of you have noticed this trend of the boomers asking for money. Something about it really gets to me emotionally because these people are moving into senior citizenry if they haven’t already. I’m not an emotional person but I fear for them and their safety and well being.",2021-03-12 21:33:01,2021,3,12,21,33,1

Anyway it turns out that the guy snaps a photo of everyone he gives the $20 to and posts it online. You can read the story here (paywall warning, use a private window in your browser if you can). It just really bothered me. Sure, the $20 would help and that is nice, but this is cringe-worthy exploitation.

lpee4y,1,kwyant38,28,homeless,Thoughts on Hiring a Homeless Person To Shop at the Goodwill Outlet,"I've been selling on ebay full time since last June. I mostly source from the local thrift stores, and the rare estate sales. My area has about 10 Goodwills, and a goodwill outlet. I mostly source at the goodwills because the ones in my area get far more donations than the other thrift stores, and put out a lot more new stuff daily. I also source in a small town nearby once a week because a few of those thrift stores always provide good inventory for cheap. A rare edition bible worth $35  for .50 for example. 

In this business you have to rely on new things coming out as 90% of highly profitable inventory will be gone within hours. 90% of the stuff on YouTube are lies. 

Contrary to popular belief,  most of the stuff that ends up at the goodwill outlet never made it into a regular goodwill store shelf. The employees are idiots, and will reject a large collection of high end golf clubs because it isn't gulf season. They will turn around and think a broken Playstation 2 is gold. Guess where those golf clubs end up?

The idea is to hire someone locally to source the local outlet from 9-3 daily Monday- Friday which are the same hours I would spend driving around from one thrift to another. It would probably take 1-2 weeks of training on what to look for.  I meet them at 3 to buy their finds. I pay daily in cash. 

This would be a part time gig, and the pay would be based on finds, although I believe they should be able to make $10 per hour.. that's money for digging through junk as opposed to a real shit job like slaving away in a warehouse for Jeff Bezos. Thoughts?",2021-02-21 20:51:29,2021,2,21,20,51,29

If someone came along who had a decent budget ($500,000 - $1M) and resources. 
What is your idea that would be most beneficial and help the most people in the homeless community. 

One idea I had....

Take 10 or so people that want to learn a trade, construction, plumbing, hvac, electrical, home inspection etc

Provide education and support to get them qualified. See up apprenticeships so they could gain the experience. 

Procure decent land and supplies and have the group construct buildings, homes etc. They then graduate and set out to build their lives. Basically, rinse and repeat. 
You could expand by opening a decent sized farm and employ more homeless to work there, build a community garden, send a few to become hairdressers, some to work in second hand shops. Etc etc. 

Basically, help people to learn skills, in return they apply those skills to improve the homeless community etc. 

Obviously, this is a very simplified version. 

Love to hear other’s ideas. 

No promises but there may be, down the road, if any idea is used, that person could have the opportunity to put it into practice.

now that ive got that out of the way let me get right to the point. I want to end homelessness, or at the very least make it a moot point. i have an idea, and i was hoping that you guys (or anyone that will talk to me) would be willing to help me figure out a few things. you see if homelessness could just be cured by giving people homes than wed have done it. homes themselves are easy. its not that simple. well how do you know, you might ask? well lets just say this. in beverly mass the town right above salem mass the witch town, right behind the train station is a little yellow building and that building is, or atleast was the river house, a homeless shelter serving as many as 25 or more every day with basic needs and outreach. i spent 2 years living there. 

i know more than most that truly ending the homelessness that is plaguing our race is going to take people power. we need to be able to have a single person with acess to a depth of socail funds and resources for every person that either is or is in immenent danger of becoming homeless and they need to be able to act outside of any border. an army of vetted volunteers spanned across the world ready to act to help prevent a single human being from being out on the streets that doesnt want to be

my idea? H:E.L.P.   Homelessness: Engagement, Logistics, and Prevention. a socially funded non-profit organization that can operate without the constraints of a singular physical office by using state of the art (or at the very least up to date technologies) to provide immediate assistance to anyone in need who may either be homeless and incapable of changing there dynamic or who may through inability become homeless. and that assistance could be determined by a team of 3, two of whom go in the feild and one of whom enters the case at the point of review.

that all being said, my request if you will, is what types of services would actually be helpful and beneficul to actually helping people become not homeless. i mean, is there a number however astronomically high it might be that we could throw at the problem and make it go away? im curious to actually talk about this because i feel strongly that sometimes people will tout the issue of homelessness just to raise money, but for what? are we building new shelters? are we sending new cots or new socks and blankets? i want to takle the human lives that are suffering simply because they think they dont matter. so please help me understand better what the problems are so i can better understand how i can help",2021-02-10 20:28:19,2021,2,10,20,28,19

lezhln,1,Pichuboy88,7,homeless,Making homelessness care packages - What should I be aware of?,"Hi everyone, I want to help out people who are homeless. I see quite a few of them when I'm out and about and well, I usually don't know what to do so I often just look away and keep moving. 

To combat this, I wanted to prep some care packages for the homeless people I see every now and then. My hope is this way I'll be better prepared to go up to, and help the homeless people around me (as long as it's safe.)  


Do you have any advice for what I should pack? This was the list I was going off of/considering:  
 

* Gallon plastic bag with zipper 
* Hand-written note card
* Printout of local resources
* Wool socks
* Water bottle
* Tuna cracker pack (or other snack)
* Nail clippers
* Some bandages
* Individually wrapped wet wipes
* Toothbrush, floss and toothpaste?
* Covid Mask?
* Some quarters for laundry/transport?

*^(-Credit to)* [*^(allgiftsconsidered.com)*](https://allgiftsconsidered.com) *^(for most of this list)*

For the socks, should I go aim mostly for quantity or quality? I've seen some people recommend going all the way on buying really nice socks, while other people say just buy cheap ones since a lot of homeless people won't have the opportunity to wash them. What do you suggest?  


In general, would a package like this be helpful for a homeless person? Let me know if there's a better use of my time and money for this purpose.  


Lastly, are there any other tips I should be aware of when interacting with homeless people? I understand I need to be wise and stay safe. Any advice for this?

A home to stay, a path forward, a step up out of the insanity of homelessness.  But because I am the skeptical sort, I did some digging.  A middle-aged woman pretending to put women in ""safe houses"" to get them away from the dire circumstances on the streets.  A woman who claims to be saving those who were ""sex trafficked"" ""domestic violenced"", ""prostituted"" etc.  I was a ""candidate"" for her program due to being a victim of a violent crime by a stranger last year.  I should have known when the ""application process"" went too quickly, too smoothly.  I became alarmed when I realized I would be sharing the home space with a woman who has had 9/9 kids taken away from her by the State due to meth addiction.  I became LEGITIMATELY in full on research mode when a woman pretending to help trafficked/addicted/abused women puts them in a ""safe house"" on a street with AT LEAST 5 known drug dealers and violent crime all around.  I did a background search on the property and the woman and have almost conclusive 100% proof she is actually a sex trafficker herself - putting those who trust her to ferry them to safety into sexual exploitation and further violence.  What a perfect cover, right? A middle aged woman talking about prayer and God and extending offers of housing to those who are obviously JUST FKN DONE being without 4 walls around them and are desperate for any good news/possible positive change to happen for them.  Yeah, lady - this ain't my first rodeo and you seriously suck posing as the savior when you're the assistant trafficker.  Finding pure evil in the World like this amidst people already struggling just to make it to the next day is infuriating.   So now I'm back to nowhere to go in snow/ice and freezing cold single digit temps.  The shelters here are not taking anyone new and have a reputation for being extremely dangerous/bug-infested and over the top obnoxious to the clients they say they serve.  Im first time homeless and honestly more pissed off right now than hopeless.  But the hopelessness settles around me in the dark at bedtime when I can't sleep and haven't eaten all day.  And yeah - I've applied for EVERYTHING.  Even got a Chime bank account so no more obnoxious bank $12 fees just for the ""crime"" of having no money in my bank account every month. What is the point of this post? Just to vent and hope people can relate and offer a kind word of hope right now, I guess.  People can seriously suck and the bad ones look for desperation and vulnerability and will prey upon it at every chance - a true wolf in sheep's clothing.  So be very careful out here, friends. Especially those new or somewhat new to being unhoused.  I may have no idea what I'm doing and I may have been handed a new life I have no idea how to navigate but I know exactly what I'm NOT GONNA DO and that is allow shitty people to take further advantage of my current dire circumstance.  So often I just want to say ""Fuck Humanity"" and quit.  Who wouldn't have that urge after the shit we witness on the daily that only further traumatizes us out here? Life is shit right now but I'm not about to let some alleged do-gooder make it an even bigger pile of shit for me.  Stay safe, friends.    And normally I'm very FTP because I have never seen ""all the good cops people are always talking about"" but have only seen the violent sadistic ones firsthand.  I am tempted to report this woman - but not to the local PD.  I'm going to call the sexual trafficking hotline and hopefully the DOJ or whoever handles that stuff will come down hard on this fake ass bitch exploiting the already exploited.  Thanks for being a kind place in a World full of unkind hate, Reddit.  You are a true sanctuary amid the insanity right now.  Reading other people's stories here does help me.  And to Sarahhyme - I believe I owe you an apology.  Because even if everything you say is FALSE (I know that it's not) we must be good to one another here.  Because I can't find kindness right now, I'm going to BE kindness.  And I may have been unkind in questioning your story.  You didn't deserve that.  No one does.  So I publicly apologize and hope only good things for you now and in the future.  It's like that old song by Jewel sings: ""It doesn't take a talent to be mean. Your words can crush things that are unseen.  So please be gentle with me - I'm sensitive and I'd like to stay that way.""

Hang on out here, friends.  Believe that for every fucked up fake offer someone tries to abuse you with, there are at least two other people in this World who would truly help if they only knew how or had the financial ability.",2021-01-26 07:30:40,2021,1,26,7,30,40

Hi everyone, my name is Daniel Muras and I'm a graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am currently working on a research project, which has been approved by my university's Institutional Review Board (IRB), dedicated to understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people experiencing homelessness and am conducting a preliminary survey to guide future stages of the research. The survey (linked below) is on Google Forms and just contains a few optional demographic questions and one open-ended question where you can basically put anything in your experience which you think is important to consider. Depending on the detail provided I anticipate it will take between 5-15 minutes. All information provided will be completely confidential (only shared with the rest of the research team). Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Note: This is survey is open to anyone who is currently or formerly homeless, as well as social service/outreach/charity workers who are working to support and help homeless individuals

Thier siblings in law were a bit mean and ended up putting me in a shelter against what my friends parents wanted. It sucked and I had my siblings who went through the same ""help"" but everyone was making things worse. 

The shelter was lgbt+ only so the staff and roommates were good and helped me recover from trauma at home. But the shelter was ran by a terrible woman who made it so that I didn't have food or medicine and wasn't able to get to my appointments or interviews. 

I had no income from my documents stolen and I was misplaced from my friends after I was sent to the shelter. Even my siblings made it worse and moved my PCP way further out of reach.
I learned how to respect myself at the shelter and stand up to people trying to help me but not listening to me about the help I needed. 
Half a year of being homeless, scraping back my documents from scratch, and standing up to myself I finally have back all of my documents and I have been hired for 20 hrs! I have never had a job before!

I'm not posting to brag but I have been working so hard and pushed down so much and I wanted to celebrate and encourage others too.
I'm so happy I've been able to be resourceful. I am smart enough not to had let my parents have any money before I left and saved anything I could. They have stolen so much money from em as well. I don't know a thing about taxes or banks or anything I needed to know as an adult before I left so I'm so glad I have amazing friends who give me the help I needed and case managers who didn't belittle me or how much I know. I'm a very capable being and I thrived when people treated me like one.
I'm very privileged to have been able to be in those spots to have never needed to sleep on the street even when people told me I ought to and they didn't care. I proved those people wrong and I didn't give them the pleasure of putting me out during a pandemic because I had resources,smarts, and support! I am so privileged but I really don't want anyone to go through what I did. No one should have to face abuse or have to resort to emergency rooms for medical health or anything else. I went through a ton of dark times but I had my friends.

Now I even have a doctor's appointment set for the first time in years! And I'm looking forward to my dream job of working on OF and other sites safely and confidently.

l0alo1,90,dirtydiva_girl,34,homeless,Impending doom,"In the past 4 years, I have been homeless 6-7 times. Each time lasting for a period of two week, up to eight months. And unfortunately, that's not including the months I've spent shacked up on the couches/spare rooms of my friends. 

I've lived outside, completely alone in the remote woods for 4-5 months. That wasn't so bad with a huge tent. Florida in the winter is great for tent life, but spring and summer is killer with the heat and bugs..The sherif found me, so I moved to a less remote spot and had gear stolen (thats haooened a few times)

Spent another month, sneaking onto the fly bridge of a huge yacht, downtown. I'd wait until about midnight and hop on board. I thought it was safe to stash by bag there for the night, but when I came back everything was gone, so that ended my stay.

Spent a lot of time crashing bathrooms and pool recliners at beach resorts (they're abundant around here and easy to sneak into, if you look presentable) I've been caught and ""escorted off the property "" multiple times, so this isn't recommended.

Most of the time has been spent in shelters, besides being treated like garbage by the staff and dealing with the general drama, that's been okay. Kept me safe and clean. Sometimes,  they've been so dirty and bed-bug polluted I've refused to stay for more than a night and once I was eaten alive for months awaiting housing.

I'm 24 now, my folks passed away. I dont have any family, and most of my friends are gone. I'm not a drug addict or an alcoholic. I work and make as much as I can. 

Fortunately I've been able to keep a roof over my head for the past 5 months. Up until yesterday I was paying $250/week for an awful motel room. Now I'm paying $400/week for a slightly better room down the street. 

If I had money for a deposit, $1600/month would get me into a high rise condo downtown,  or a 3 bedroom house in a nice area..but instead all it gets me is an outdated room in the ""hood""

I can just feel the homelessness coming! I'm so afraid to get comfortable anywhere because I always end up losing everything and being back to the curb. The anxiety and depression is crippling and I can't even form a thought sometimes.

All of my time and energy goes to worrying about keeping a place to live, I can't sleep or eat half the time I'm so worried about where I'll be tomorrow or the next day and I'm so scared of being homeless again. I have a pet cat now and if I'm on the street it'll be really hard with him.

And then want to act like you’re unreasonable for wanting them to respect your privacy and space.,"Here I am: Come from a modest background. No drugs. No drinking. Actually pretty okay with my life, minus not having a job.

One of my privileged friends talks so badly about the homeless. For the longest time, I would just listen without revealing I was homeless. The things she would say were so hateful and ignorant. I find it ironic, considering many rich people who benefit from having wealthy parents and/or an inheritance will have destructive habits like drug and alcohol use, like she does, except they have a cushion and safety net for their behavior.

Anyway, she grew increasingly angry at me for turning down her persistent requests to hang out (a red flag, by the way). I finally told her I was in a bad living situation, and then her behavior shifted to demanding a text message and status report every day with my location, as well as disclosing where I usually sleep.

No thanks.

First of all, it’s safer for me to *not* share those details. Secondly, that’s controlling behavior, and I’m not a fan.

Anyway, I confided in another friend where I would usually stay. And as people love gossip, word quickly spread, and people started showing up to my car, leaving things, and expecting me to open my window coverings and wave to them like a zoo animal.

No thanks.

I knew getting angry and expressing my displeasure would only reinforce the ignorant narratives these people tell themselves (“He got angry! He must have mental health issues like all homeless people”) about homeless people. So I just reduced contact with them.

I guess I did so too abruptly, because they called me out on it. Again, I knew being honest would lead to bad outcomes, so I gently avoided their questions.

Since then, we haven’t talked. It has been about a couple months.

They probably feel good about themselves, dropping random stuff they think I need on my car. Of course, they couldn’t be bothered to actually *ask* what I need: a good job. They just want to provide what makes them feel good about themselves. Mission accomplished, I guess. And now I guess we’re not friends for the time being.

Dudes don't even have respect for ya, if you're flying a sign trying to make a few bucks, they will sit down and fly thier own like 25 feet away. Like dude, give some space and wait your turn. One guy pissed me off though I didn't show it. he was looking for Snipes on the ground so I went to offer him a cigarette. I kept my cigarette because he ended up buying a pack. But what pissed me off was he said that he had already eat twice today and might eat a third time. And then he went back to sit and fly sign for more. While I hadn't eaten all yet. Finally about 4:00 p.m. he decides to wander off, and I go and try my hand. I make three bucks in 2 hours. Enough for a sandwich at Walmart but that's about it. But American wastefulness saves the day. I waited till 10:30, after the mini mall closed, which is next to Walmart. Then raided the dumpster. Little Caesars dumpster specifically. Walked away with three hot pizzas they threw away at the end of the day. 

So tip for people who are hungry, if you didn't know Little Caesars Cooks pizzas ahead of time. So if there's one nearby check their dumpster about 30 minutes or so after they close. It's hit an miss, as staff take pizzas home with them too, but if there's pizza left they get tossed.

kov1l0,99,rude1rude9rude,14,homeless,1 month homeless. What I've found to make the day to day easier with 'hacks'.,"1.) First and foremost, having a storage unit has been invaluable. Even with me not panhandling just hanging out near gas stations and grocery stores to charge my phone, and mind my own business, attracts enough 1-2 dollar donations to pay for the unit. 
2.) Having cheap or free phone service is worth more than the service itself. Many gas stations and fast food venues have promotional offers for cheap or free food (creating multiple google accounts multiplies the offers). Text in offers, such as the free coffee deal at circle K, are useful especially with a text app where you can delete your number and have the offer constantly accessable with each new number you get in its place.
3.) Older and slightly worn out (but mostly clean) clothes attract more charitable people than either nice clothes or dirty, torn up garb.
4.) Being helpful, polite, and straight forward goes miles in terms of people helping you and keeping police from constantly harassing you.
5.) Seeking out a church (even if non-christan such as myself) to associate with usually comes with helpful and resourceful church goers and pastors. 
6.) A drawing pad and a book are wonderful sources of entertainment and great time passing activities.
7.) Drugs and homelessness are mostly a combination to avoid. (Duh)
8.) Hydration prevents quickly recurrent hunger. Vitamins/minerals prevent cravings of sweets, greasy food, meat, salt and dairy. Both provide superior energy, focus, sense of well being, improved appearance (skin, hair, acne, wound infections,
9.) Oregano Oil, Tea Tree Oil, hydrogen peroxide, and a small bottle of colloidal silver have been invaluable medicines for almost any sort of infection,/ailment.
10.) Black Soap. If you're going to carry your own soap due to location and convenience definitely give this a try. Its a traditional and natural African soap that generally has few ingredients minus some with ess. oils for fragrance. It works amazing as either hand/face/body soap and works awesome as shampoo and really gets the dirt/grease out of hair. 
11.) Not an option for all obviously. But my Red Wing brand original style boots with gore tex lining have been the biggest blessing. I can be comfortably on foot all day, feet stay dry and warm when cold and not sweaty when hot. My last pair survived 8 years of beatings via landscaping and carpentry, with the worse damage being the sole losing about 3/4 of the tread, before they were stolen.",2021-01-02 03:00:55,2021,1,2,3,0,55

Retrieve them that evening, before dew hits them if you don't want them wet; if they get wet they'll  start to smell again anyway like clothes you took out of the dryer too soon do after a few days. This won't get rid of any sort or stains of course, but smells are caused by bacteria, and the sun kills it. By evening your clothes will be smelling fresh. So if you have a shirt that isn't very dirty, but reaks of sweat, this will fix it. Turning them inside out b4 you hang them will help prevent fading too.

Not super deep, maybe 2 house lots in size, with a road behind it. About a month ago I spotted a tent probably 10 yards from my fence go up. At first it felt a bit weird (actually at first it gave me a heart attack because I just saw flashlights in the woods at 3am), but honestly once I got past the weirdness of it they haven't been any different than the rest of my neighbors.


A couple weeks ago it got really cold. I saw them moving around in their tent, and called out asking if they had warm enough clothes. They gave kind of a rushed ""yeah we're good, merry christmas"" followed by ""who's that"". I told them I was the guy living in the house and just wanted to make sure they were OK because it had suddenly gotten cold. They gave a quick ""yeah we're good thanks"" and that has been the extent of our interactions.


I couldn't tell if they legitimately didn't want to talk much, or were worried that if they were discovered they'd be kicked out, or were just surprised. Any advice on things that would help you out if you were in their position? Should I try to offer them help again? I come from a rough background so understand the bad times that people go through, want to do what I can for my neighbors, but if it's legitimately best to just leave them alone then I'm good with just giving them their space (after all, I'd hate for a 'nosy neighbor' to be constantly checking up on me, if that's what I'd come across as).

I'm more of a homeless vagabond I tend to only spend a day or two in a city before moving to the next stop.

A few days ago I was charging my phone up outside a storefront and the business called the police. No big deal I was asked to leave and I immediately started packing up.

One of the officers struck up a conversation with me and ended up going to Walmart and bought me an entire rotisserie chicken! And then told me a great spot away from people I could sleep.

I know there are cops who like to abuse their power but remember their are plenty of good ones out there, and in my experience more often then not when you show them respect they show it back.

Anyway, I hope you're all staying warm. Be safe.",2020-12-07 19:54:03,2020,12,7,19,54,3

And would like to offer any advice that I was so lucky to get from the ones who came before me when I was unaware of what to do.

Having said that I came to this subreddit looking for less serious discussions that focus more on the fine points and positives of homelessness and homeless culture in north america. But nonetheless I'm afraid such a subreddit does not exist yet. So here I am, in Hope's of meeting other like minded homeless people stumbling drunkenly across america and loving it, while also here to offer any advice to anybody looking to make something of a life that is mostly thought of to be denied by capitalistic and modern societies alike.

jyqlvu,0,Hollowness999,36,homeless,Homeless Minority in Seattle,"What it's like being homeless while also being a minority in a city with one of the biggest homeless populations. 

I'm not joking, nor fishing for attention. Honestly, I'm just ranting. 

I'm scared to use a lot of the resources that people assume all this time and tax money go I to, because they never help people like me. 

I am ALWAYS passed over.

They flat out tell me, ""We only help x type of homeless person.""
Uh, okay??! Isn't that ILLEGAL? Am I somehow less cold, or in danger?

Being female, I am in *more* danger from wandering, rowdy men.
I am afraid to use some bathrooms, because they find their way in anyway. After a lifetime of abuse from MEN, I NEED A SAFE  SPACE FROM PENISES SOMETIMES!!! 

Thanks!!! Just for a while. I've met some wonderful men, and I want them to stay safe, too. But can I just have a bathroom and shower?! Don't they need their own space, too? 

Today, someone handed me a large printout of resources for the homeless, to include housing resources. 

I was lead on a wild goose chase, looking up potential places that might just, somehow, by some miracle, offer me four walls to stay in. Maybe even an apartment. 
There are always such promises. 
And it's the same thing, every time. 

They're full, no waiting list, especially because of COVID. I don't qualify. 

I saw a beautiful villa. It looked like a real home, a real community.
They were letting people stay THERE?! 

And then I saw it. 

""We don't help people like YOU. This is for the PRIVELEGED class of people that we selected.""

How do you think that felt? 

I've never treated anyone like this before, because it's honestly never occurred to me to. 
People tell me I deserve to feel bad for existing. 

I don't, to be honest. The whole world is upside down to me, including all this. 

Even so, every day, I'm told that I matter less than everyone else does. I'm a ""biggot"" for having different morals, and a different way of life. 
Every day, people try and tell me I am wrong for having been born a white, straight Christian female.

I am mostly healthy, my life has been devoid of any addictions, and I have no children, so I am always passed over for housing.

There is no reward for virtue. If I were to get pregnant by some random dude, I'd be housed pretty quickly, actually. I would never do that, firstly, because the child doesn't deserve this; second, morality. 

If I were a prostitute, I'd have more money, and be eligible for several specialized programs. 
If I were a deviant of gender or sexual orientation, there are lots of resources exclusive to thay type I could get in on.
If I were addicted or an alcoholic, I would be eligible for several programs.

None of those would be ritzy, but you know, I'm just as cold as anyone. 
The reason that special programs for certain races exist is so they can skip the line, and they're all happy to do it. 
Everyone needs their own community. 

Where is the short line for white Christian women, enduring the trauma of watching their nation fall apart, while the world laughs at them? And tells them ""nothing is happening to you"", as only an abuser would?

They send you a check and usually will ask you to send back a portion of it because they sent too much.

jt44g7,90,Captain-Crunch1989,24,homeless,Never underestimate the power of a generic suit.,"So I'm laying down in my bed at the shelter, studying. My CDL manual, and i hear an announcement come over the intercom. ""If anyone is interested in filing for food stamps, medicare, or Medicare, please line up at the front office.

For those of you who are not in the DRM in denver, the front office is the space where people check in from the outside. Its also the only means of non emergency exit for the building, some of you may already realise how chaotic this is going to be.

When i get to the front of the line, i get my food stamp appointment scheduled, just as half a dozen people try to get in for scanning. 

So we have people coming in who need to get checked by the guards, people waiting in line for food stamp stuff, and people lining up behind both groups.

I suggest rather loudly ""You folks may want to move this over to the cafeteria, it'll be much less chaotic for everyone that way."" Amd they almost immediately agree.

I can honestly say that wouldn't have worked out. Had ot not been for the button down dress shirt and presentable jeans i was wearing. A ""Professional"" outfit that i picked up from goodwill.

I say all that to give you this moral: a well dressed person conveys authority, experience, and knowledge. A bum does not. There are plenty of charities and goodwill stores across America, especially in bigger cities.  Get to a big city, get your suit, and get yourself on track.

jt7c3m,0,RaphaelPrinz,2,homeless,Things people don't consider,"Hey, I'm from the Uk and I was having a discussion where I was arguing that not being able to escape homelessness is an illusion, laziness and an excuse. This subreddit has really given me a new perspective and I still had some things that I was curious about and couldn't find easily.  I know some of these sound not only ignorant but also inconsiderate.(then why ask) I prefer you thinking I'm a cunt, (because quite frankly I am) if it means you answer my question than the other way round. Burst my bubble.

1. Is there theft among the homeless?
2. How much education did you receive in your life?
3. how much does the family home and childhood factor into it?
4. In the Uk, in my hometown, the church has a very strong connection to the homeless and they help quite a few out of poverty, or so I'm told by my mother. Is this common?
5. Is there no support from other charities, not to just give you soup but get you out of poverty?
6. I imagine myself sometimes seeing homeless people with I-phones when walking? How is this possible that some homeless people are more homeless than others? 
7. what percentage of homeless people have criminal records? How many people become homeless because of their criminal record?
8. (I'm sorry) If every homeless person made a plan and really followed it. (take the psychology/mental game out of it. Assume you work and sleep without thinking of relapsing) What percentage of homeless people could make it out of poverty/(homelessness?)?
9. is the shortage of jobs or not getting accepted by employers the issue when trying to get a job? Would increasing the jobs available really do anything against homelessness figures?
10. how many homeless people are foreigners? Do people arrive in the UK and are forced to the streets?
11. What drugs to homeless people resort to most often and why?(I don't even know why I want to know this one?)
12. How much of homelessness is due to mental reasons( I don't mean mental conditions I mean anything psychological)?
13. How much did your upbringing result in you becoming homeless?
14. How do you cook food? Do you eat hot food? are you allowed to make fires? 
15. How easy is it to find shelter?
16. Why do I so rarely see homeless people that are female? Do people care less about men? Do female homeless people ever get picked up and..sort of go into relationships just to avoid being homeless? (these are theories and I'm expecting to be proven very wrong)
17. How much of being homeless has to do with self-control? Are you more prone to give in to your urges? is that a thing? 

I had some more but I can't remember them.

jsnaji,243,Carboneraser,54,homeless,"To members of the community who are against housing the homeless, you aren't economical or realistic, you are cruel.","I choose to make this post due to a conversation I had with another r/homeless user in a recent thread about housing the homeless.

No matter what was suggested, he seemed to shut it down. I explained how housing the homeless works in Canada, how the government has publicly stated that our program to put every homeless person into their own individual hotel room at current market cost (lower than normal but considerable still) has saved them more money than leaving them on the street would.

See, housing the homeless doesn't mean creating a burden on regular citizens. It really sounds like it should, but it doesn't. The user in question dismissed this idea because I am Canadian and he is american.

But this isn't a Canadian phenomenon. In America, Canada and many parts of Europe, it has been demonstrated that housing the homeless is not a net loss, that money is actually saved. This is due to the limited police interaction, emergency room visits, rates of sexual violence, theft, risk of lethal overdose and untreated physical or mental illness that becomes a problem in the future. 

He then dismissed that by saying that criminals will be criminals and some nonsense about the 'gubment' (his word).

It is cheaper here to pay for $100 a day hotel rooms for Canadians who apply (in provinces that actually followed through with the program) than it is to leave them on the streets. It is more humane to house the homeless than it is to leave them on the streets.

There is not an excuse to be against housing the homeless anymore. It isn't a political position, it isn't an economical decision, it is cruel and built upon the idea of ""I work for what I have why shouldn't they"" or ""why should I pay for them to kick back in a home they don't pay for"". 

Nobody is asking you to pay. We are trying to SAVE you money. Nobody is suggesting hotel rooms either. The fact that hotels are cheaper than doing nothing should demonstrate how much money we waste keeping the homeless homeless. Now imagine low-cost housing, built en mass, interspersed in communities across America that suffer from a homelessness crisis, that costs a lot less than $100 per person per day. If that doesn't float your boat, that's cool! But you should come up with an even better suggestion because doing nothing isn't the right answer.

jqsx89,3,newaccfuckthatbitch,11,homeless,Any tips for people who just became homeless?,"I'm in 15 male, in Alberta canada and just left my house because I'm hated. 

A month ago 2 bitches from my school decided to make a false rape claim against me. The 3rd floor is closed due to corona or something, and they claimed that I told the one girl to meet her up there and il show her something. They then claimed that I was raping the girl in a room and the friend went to go help. I was on the 2nd floor at this time, but was in the bathroom for quite a while passing time because I had credits for my 2nd period. 

This the  led to me being ""suspended"" (more so expelled because I haven't been let back in like a month) all my friends except a couple have been shit to me, and my parents hate me. They didnt kick me out, but I knew I was hated there. I bet they were planning on kicking me out because they wouldn't talk to me or make me food or anything. It was like I wasn't even there. 

Last night I left. I knew it would better for me to leave, so I packed my clothes, my laptop, phone, powerbank, and about $1000 cash I had saved. I also (conveniently) packed a bugout bag a while back with cooking utensils, sleeping bag, bandages, and pretty much everything that would keep me going for a while. I packed 3 days worth of dehydrated food in the bag, so I have a pretty good start I think. I have a pretty big backpack, as it was a surplus military backpack. I haven't recieved any messages from nobody besides the ones from random people adding me on snapchat and sending me threats, and some messages from my close friends who knew I was in the bathroom at the time. Non from my parents, so it's obvious they aren't looking for me.

I hooked a ride from my small town of about 500 people and took it to lloydminister. I have a pretty warm jacket and decent enough clothes so it dosent look like I'm homeless, which is good. I'm currently behind a strip mall and have a vent that exhausts warm air. I'm planning on staying here for the night as there's no footsteps in the snow to indicate there's not much activity around here. 

My main concerns are shelter and an income. I would prefer to be in a hotel/rented room. However, without an address or permanent address it would be hard to get an income, so it would be hard to keep staying there. I have my ID, and I have my laptop and access to a printer. Should I create documents to make it look as if I have a permanent address in lloydminister? I have adobe photoshop on my laptop. 

I'm so fucking angry that I dont have a voice and those bitches ruined my life for no reason. I had everything going good for me, I even had a possible scholarship to a private school as I was excelling in all subjects. I would've had a great future, but no, some bitches had to fucjin ruin my fuckin life for no reason. I barely even knew those pieces of shit. 

Can anyone help me out with some knowledge? I'd really appreciate any tips. Thanks",2020-11-08 23:57:30,2020,11,8,23,57,30
jqlt7r,2,ae4137AE,4,homeless,My Master Plan,"Hi all, im a newly homeless 20 year old, Va here. Ill preface by saying ive done, been, been through, and experienced my fair share of life, despite my age. Im going to cut the shit, and get to my point. Ever since i left for college, i had always wondered what my purpose was. I always loved people, and thought of myself as a classical thinker, a kinetic learner, and a people person in general. After I had to leave college last dec., i spent a year wondering why i was so complacent and how something would never let me settle. As some background, i was an international relations and philosophy double major, minoring in Spanish. I had paid for all the schooling i got myself, but due to my aunt/uncle renouncing me for trying to become independent, i couldn’t continue. I threw around the idea of the military with a friend, and we got a place so we could prepare for it. Two months down the road he tells me he never cared, and that Things got so easy on me when my parents passed, and that everyone was right about me being a failure. I am out to prove my family and him wrong, and make my parents proud. What i can truly see myself doing for at least a few years, is getting a van and traveling the country to speak with people like ourselves, and learn about their stories, Give them some food, And make sure that everyone knows that they are loved, no matter your circumstance. Id live off doordashing, and honestly with this week i can say i have ‘transcended materialism’ which is why id be okay with a minimalist and free spirited lifestyle. If you guys have any questions, any comments, or hell if you’d like to give me some stops, comment your state and city, and ill be on my way out of va in a month or two. I look forward to learning from and meeting all of you, and remember, someone cares. I care. I just want to show that i care. My one request to any listener or reader is just to put a little more love into the world, in one where we are so divided over stupid, trivial things like the color of your skin or what gender you are. All of you are welcome at my table, and all of my children eat. Stay safe, stay warm, and stay motivated. ❤️",2020-11-08 16:09:40,2020,11,8,16,9,40

jnm4ug,7,Vivid_Asparagus_5280,6,homeless,"Chronically homeless, need better survival skills","Hi there, 21F here. I struggle with severe chronic mental illness that leaves me homeless over and over again, and even though I have a home now it's pretty inevitable that it happens again. I'm at peace with that for now but I've realized I have no skills to keep me safe by myself. When homeless I've nearly always relied on others for safety; I'm a young woman with aspergers, so on top of already being a possible target, my interpersonal knowledge is questionable and could be taken advantage of (I'm extremely cautious with strangers, but emotional manipulation is a weakness of mine). Up until now I've survived only because of shelters, other kind homeless people who would take me under their wing, and a GREAT amount of luck. I'm in a different country now though where there are no easily accessible shelters like before and the homeless folks are different, so I'm going to need to fend for myself, and that's a first time for me. I know how to set up camp and stay warm, I have the gear, but I never know where I would be safe inside of cities, especially now that I'm alone. I don't know how to read people as well as others. I am a woman, so I'm weak and small. I don't have any skills to panhandle or work day jobs. Last time I was homeless a friend took me hitchhiking, which is what I want to do again (if the coronacrisis ends) since staying in one place is not really an option here, but I am a liability and have no valuable skills whatsoever to make another homeless person/hitchhiker want to take me under their wing again, except being funny and kind and speaking 4 languages (I'm in Europe), but that's about it, and it's of no use if I need to be independent and take care of myself. I'm just... looking for some skills that I can learn now that I temporarily have a home so that when I inevitably end up homeless again, I will be in a less dire situation than I would be in now. Was wondering if anyone has any suggestions? Think skills to panhandle, work day/temp jobs (maybe learn to paint/fix sinks/farming or something else I could do wherever for a couple of days if the mental illness allows me), how to decide on a good hiding spot within big cities, things like sewing or other skills that could be useful. Stuff that doesn't take very long to learn because my mental illness doesn't allow me to commit to anything for more than a couple of weeks at most. How to know who's got bad intentions. I don't know. I just, I don't think I will be as lucky if I end up homeless again so I would appreciate any and all advice from you guys. Like really, anything will do.

As for therapy/medication, I've been medicated since kindergarten, tried 8+ different kinds of medication, and been in therapy for 7 years, inpatient twice. Seen so many therapists/psychologists/psychiatrists I lost count. For some people mental illness doesn't get better or if it does, only very, very slowly. I'm sure I will get there eventually but it's going to take many years, and in those years I will relapse, since that's just part of the package deal for me. So I'm looking to make those relapses as safe and non-traumatic as possible.

TL;DR: I'm chronically homeless, will be homeless again, am a young female and have no idea how to stay safe, make money, or have any other useful skills to get by all by myself, and I need to work on that now before it's too late. Would appreciate all advice. Sorry if I sound stupid, this is just the way things are for me right now. Thanks for reading.",2020-11-03 17:04:08,2020,11,3,17,4,8

jkhbwh,126,MF_VIHCIT,31,homeless,Chick-Fil-A and the Look of Hunger,"Drove up to a homeless guy standing on a median and was shocked by the look on his face. I usually kindly ignore homeless people to the best of my ability because I've been scammed a few times but I could tell that he was hungry. I read his sign and he wasn't even asking for money; he just wanted a meal. So I rolled down my window and asked him if he had eaten today. He shook his head so I told him to go to the Chick-Fil-A within a stones throw of his median and that I'd buy him a meal there. He sort of muttered ""Chick-Fil-A"" and I said ""Yeah, I gotya"" and I headed that way. The look on his face was utterly hunger. I had never seen hunger so clearly painted on someone's facial features as the way he looked. It wasn't that his face was drooping, it was that it had turned sour in a gaunt way. I've been having trouble eating in general because of my Crohn's disease, but what he had was something else. There was a certain dull hate in the expression on his face that caused me genuine concern for him.

I got out of my car so he could see me as he was walking up, didn't want him unsure as to whether or not he was going to eat. I was already drinking some Starbucks so I planned on going inside with him, talking with him while he ate and then getting him a meal to go but we found that the indoor dining area was closed because of Covid. So I just told him to hop in my car and we'd go through the drive-thru. When he got in the car I told him that I could tell that he was truly hungry from the look on his face. I had been homeless a few times myself but nothing like what he was likely going through. He was about 5'10'', muscular in build but his clothes were so ragged that I could tell he was in the middle of it. He was all tattoos and beard, with a rasp to his voice like he smoked a lot of cigarettes.

When he got in the car I instantly felt a bit of fear, thinking he might pull a knife on me or something but I remembered how I survived a suicide attempt last April where I sliced my own throat with a karambit knife and the thought calmed me. I bled a lot that night and still survived, so even if he had cut me open... I'd still be a tough customer. I asked him how long he had been homeless and he said that it had been since his wife died. She overdosed on heroin while they were trying to kick the habit with suboxone. The police were not very friendly to him when he happened upon her, sitting ""Indian style"", dead with a needle in her arm. He gave her two doses of NARCAN to no avail. I gave him my condolences, which was the best I could do. He showed me his needle tracts, proudly stating that he was kicking the habit. I got him two meals, one for now and one for later and a couple of drinks.

I asked him where I could drop him off and he told me back over at the gas station next to his median. Turns out that gas station was pretty friendly to him. They'd let him charge his phone, use their bathroom and chill outside to eat. As I was pulling up, I remarked to him that he needs to find some shelter by the time it starts to get cold this winter - that capitalism kills lots of people this way and that it is extremely underreported. When he was getting out, I remarked that I wish that I could do more for him - which he told me not to worry about. I had introduced myself by my first name, ""Angel"" but I usually go by my middle name, Julian. It occurred to me as he was getting out that I hadn't asked him his name when he first walked up so I asked him there when he was getting out of my car. He told me his name was ""Chris"". I told him that if I saw him again and could afford to, that I'd buy him another meal, to which he was gracious. I also told him not to give up as he set the last of his stuff on the curb. He told me that he'd never give up. I plan on returning to see Chris soon. Something about him smacked of a brighter future.

Moral of the story: Don't assume every homeless person is going to slash your throat if you let them into your car. If someone is just asking for food - not money - then their situation is desperate. Everyone has a story, and sometimes just articulating it to someone else shows them the next step on their journey.",2020-10-29 13:53:52,2020,10,29,13,53,52
jkd85m,5,Captain-Crunch1989,30,homeless,It's not racism if evidence proves I'm right.,"So a man who happens to be black stole things out of my storage case at the shelter today. 

I told denver rescue mission that things were stolen from my storage case (never said a black guy stole it), and was immediately chastised for being a racist.

As is procedure, denver rescue mission looked over the security footage to determine who the thief was. Surprise surprise, not only was it a black guy, but it was the same black guy who's been kicked out a few times before, because he did the exact same thing.

Somehow, the man with the bachelors degree in private investigation (i.e. me) is still racist for coming to the conclusion that this individual who stole my things is a black guy, despite evidence to back up my claim. 

Its not racism if its fact. If it was a Hispanic guy, I'd have said hispanic, if it was a white guy, I'd have said white.

Yes, its possible that i could have been wrong. But i wasn't.

Obviously I can't know everything about every situation, location, and complication.  But there are many wise and far more experienced people on this forum, especially when it comes to actually being homeless, so I would gladly defer to them if I can.

I am not homeless anymore, but Covid keeps a return to the streets in the back of my mind all the time.  I find myself planning how to face it if that day comes again.  One of the things that would have helped in my previous homeless stints would have been the ability to scrape up even small amounts of money.  In 2020, it must be much harder.  $60 would have got me some combo of storage, gym membership, bus passes, hygiene items, phone bill, or even a luxury item or 2 to make life a little easier.  Well, if you get food stamps, this is a easy, LEGAL way to get extra cash AND keep your food.

The Ibotta app gives cash back on many items you already buy.  It is free.  The only downside is you need to plan your store trips in advance.  I remember having hours of boredom in the library, so this should not be a hurdle.  There are probably strategies to maximize your earnings.  This is mine.  Maybe there are better ones out there.

First, most major grocery stores have thier own app.  If you are close to one, get it.  If you live in a city and have the ability to shop several stores, get them all.  Download the Ibotta app.  Go through every item and add anything to you list that you might want or need and any items with a high cashback to price ratio.  For example, if you know something costs $2.49 and it has a cashback of $1.50, add it.  If you have a place to store food, a refrigerator, and ways to cook, everything is available to you.  You may not have that.  There are probably people that spend all thier foodstamps on granola bars and protein bars.  These items are always available for cashback.  If you list use the Ibotta app alone, you can make $40 or so a month and keep the food.  If you get the store app as well and cross reference for weekly local sales with Ibotta, you can double your cashback.  There are many examples of BOGO in the Ibotta app and then BOGO on the same item at the local store.  In these instances you are spending food stamp money to get 2 items which you will get all that back in cash through Ibotta.  You items become free and you get cash.  There are even rare cases when you make money because combining the sales gives you more than the cost of the food.

I have made about $120 in the past 2 months using only food stamps.  There are many other apps out there.  They may pay more or it may be possible to stack offers.  It all depends on the effort you want to put in.

Ok, sounds good.  Has to he a catch, right?  A small one, yes.  You need a paypal account to cash out.  If you have an address you can have one mailed free.  If not, you can get one for a couple dollars at walmart.  You need $20 in cashback to cash out.   Not really a problem.  $40 is easy to get with almost no effort.  Cash out is instant.  711 atms offer no fee paypal card withdrawals.

A couple things to keep in mind to get the most money.  Plan ahead.  If you find a great deal,  most reappear in the app a couple days later.  Look for more bonuses under earn more.  If you can plan a couple trips a week, you will make more.  Sometimes in the middle of the week, they throw out a $5 bonus that is easy to get.

I hope this helps someone,  I know it would have helped me a lot.  Keep pushing forward and hang in there everyone. 2020 won't last forever, it just feels that way.",2020-10-12 11:40:22,2020,10,12,11,40,22

**Please be gentle and kind. Since knowing this I've been feeling so restless, depressed and anxious...**

Details:

've written it down for a while but been not able to read it back:

We met online. I was doing the last semester of my first degree. He was on the edge of being broke, homeless and hopeless (he decided to kill himself when he gets too old and has lots of physical pain). As a friend, I suggested him that he should give a try in China. This was a suggestion based on his 15 years of living in Korea. He got married with a Korean and they had their own school there. He described his ex-wife as a workaholic, and a crazy and materialistic person. He said the business was great but they were burnt out so they closed the business and went to Canada to live. He said they spent too much time together and argued a lot so they divorced, He did not fight for anything as he knew she would do everything to get everything they made together. He went back to live with his mother who was in need of being taken cared of.

He went to Beijing in November, 2016. Due to a number of reasons, he did not like the city and job when he first came to the city where was far away from me. He then came to Shenzhen and had great difficulty of being employed due to his hearing problem and physical health conditions. We dealt with his visa problem for half a year (during January to May in 2017). Finally, we made it. Also as a non degree holder, he worked as an online teacher. The teaching hours however were not enough to support his living. After a period of hard time, he had been gradually rebuilding his life this year since June. Before that I had been offering lots of financial help. It was not asked by him at all.

In mid October I received his call and he told a bunch of police came to his place out of sudden. We lost contact very soon. I then contacted the local consulate. The next day they told me they were informed that he was in administrative detention as he did not hold the appropriate work permit. They also told me that the period of detention shall be within 15 to 30 days according to the law(s). Last Friday was his 30th day. The consulate sent some people to visit him to know more about the matter. They got informed by the local authorities that his investigation has been extended since they think his case is complicated.

I thought I could get an answer last Friday but it turned out to be very unexpected. It has been an ordeal for me for more than a month. I spent time on thinking about what else I could do to 'help' me and him. It took me lots of time to find out his mom's address in Canada as well as his ex-wife's information (contact number, e-mail and how she's doing generally). I did contact his mom on phone but did not contact his ex-wife as according to what I have known she's married to someone else in Canada and got her citizenship there. There is no point of contacting her though I was desperately looking for some possible help in any kind.

I finished my postgraduate programme in May this year. I had been taking several part-time jobs, including tutoring kids in a private center, at their home, and adults, and some other gigs.

In April I found I had more and more physical discomfort. In mid May I was sent to a hospital and diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. I tried the antidepressant given by the hospital for a week but got lots of severe side effects, including high frequency of panic attacks lasting for at least two to three hours. I stopped taking it in May. Gradually got a bit better in June, and better in July but in August I had a bad cough. My breathing difficulty appeared a lot more often in August. September is my birthday month and I thought I would be a lot better in Sept. when I first knew I had this issue in May. I inwardly set time for my recovery, which was very stupid. I got physically very ill in September and mentally collapsed. He had been affected by my health issues. He got so depressed. He went to drink very often during August to October. I was back to medication last month. I have been taking stabilizer and antidepressant. I have choking anxiety and an OCD of cough (esp. after eating and whenever I feel 'suffocated'). I have been seeing different therapists as well since July.

I deeply knew I should prioritize my physical and mental health first but I cannot help let the negativity of everything about him go.

Edited in 16 Nov, 2018 (the above)

After 35 days of being in a detention house he was released and requested to leave mainland China within 24 hours. He left Shenzhen in 24th October and went to Hong Kong to rest for a few days before taking a long-hour flight back to his home country.

I did not know anything about these until he told me. He told me for 35 days everyone in the detention house could be only allowed to stay in the house. Sometimes it was very crowed. Every day they could only sit on a bench after waking up. Everyone was only given a thin blanket to stay warm at night. There were only squat toilets with no walls or doors. The odor was lousy at the time. Only Chinese foods were given. There were many homosexuals, and it was often seen that some sexual moments under their blankets. Some even touched him, and it reminded him of a misery happened in his childhood. He was raped by his elder brother when he was little up to 15 years old. When staying there he always banged his forehead to the wall or bars to kill himself. He had no idea about when he would be released. He had a bad cold for a few weeks. He was always smacked by some light sleepers there when he got into deeper sleep and snored. He did not shower or brushed for 35 days, like everyone there.

After staying for a few days in Hong Kong, he took a flight back to Vancouver. The first week he held a positive attitude about bettering himself. However after the first week he has been very depressed. He has zero desire to talk to me. Even I sent him emails that contained information about mental health resources that he could try to get help from in his place, he has not replied me at all. I understand that he is now undergoing jail and rape traumas but I already helped him search information that he could seek help from. I do not understand why it would be that hard for him to make phone calls to those centers to book appointments. He also needs a physical health check but he has not asked his doctor (nurse practitioner) to arrange one for him. I asked him to call some other doctors who can receive new patients but he has not done that yet.

Since weed has been legalized throughout Canada, he has been taking weed for two week at least and drinks a lot to try to numb himself. I feel so disappointed as he promised me he would not do that when he was back to Vancouver.

He left me no choice but only said, 'concentrate on myself''. I am really feeling despondent.

Something more about myself:

I had breathing difficulty and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder since May. My OCD has been developing (and changing a bit from time to time). First I had choking anxiety so I ate very slowly and kept silent for the entire time of having a meal. Later I was afraid I did not consume adequate amount of calories and I might feel uncomfortable easily. I forced myself to eat something between meals. Now I cough after I eat something. Very often I cough to puke. I have kind of managed myself that I do not cough to vomit but I still cough a lot after eating. If I do not cough I feel so uncomfortable and anxious. Even I cough I do not feel a sense of instant relief but a bit ""better"".

iyl89y,156,whale_lover,14,homeless,Housed lurkers with giving intentions: Most homeless people start doing drugs AFTER they become homeless to cope with the misery that comes with being unhoused.,"While I acknowledge that some people do become homeless after falling into the spiral of addiction, a lot of experience servicing the homeless community has led me to realize that a lot of them became addicts once they were on the streets. 

I see people posting about not wanting to give people on the streets cash because they'll use it for drugs and it really breaks my heart because it really doesn't address the root of the issue. 

First things first the person you're trying to help is an autonomous person with thoughts, preferences and desires. By giving them cash you're recognizing that they're human and can decide what they want and need on their own. Either choose to help them or don't but don't patronize them.

The drug use in the unhoused community is a coping tool. It's often used as self medication for an untreated mental disorder. A reflection of our inaccessible health system. It is also often a survival tool. I've spoken to a lot of people (women in particular) who started using methamphetamine to stay awake to avoid being robbed or raped at night, and then they use heroin to try to get some sleep during the day. 

When people do want to get clean, there are very very few beds to detox in, and not having heroin/alcohol can lead to deadly withdrawls if not medically supervised. Withdrawls on a hot sidewalk is hellishly deadly for a lot of people. That's not even considering living in a state with no public health safety net insurance where detox centers are just non - existant. 

And where government fails charity steps in right? No. A lot of the drug recovery treatment charities are a front for churches wanting to recruit members. There is a giant Christian charity near where I do my outreach that charges people per charity service they receive in the payment form of an hour of mass attendance. Do you want breakfast? You owe one hour of church attendance. Do you want lunch? You owe hour of church attendance. Do you want to attend Narcotics Anonymous? That will be one hour of church attendance. Mandatory all day Sunday mass attendance if you dare want to sleep in their shelters. They also have strict curfews and timed dispersals. It is impossible to take these ""charity"" services and hold down a job.  

This religious perspective to drug treatment turns people off. Especially younger people who tend to be non-religious. 

If you're really concerned about the people living on the streets using drugs, you should organize and lobby you're elected officials for:
 
Safe injection sites supervised by medical professionals with a direct line to treatment for those who want it + Narcan distribution + drug testing for fentanyl, dignified shelters, clean needle exchanges, safe parking lots for car dwellers, affordable public housing, a living minimum wage, LGBTQ+ acceptance, a robust jobs training program run by strong unions, a city budget that funds mental health counselors and social workers, and a robust free at the point of use universal mental health/medical system. Anything short of that will not even come close to addressing the issues unhoused people have.",2020-09-23 16:54:09,2020,9,23,16,54,9

&#x200B;

TL;DR at the bottom  


I had been couch surfing until a friend's aunt insist i stay with her; guess she thought it'd be a short stay (and I did, too). Fast forward 3 weeks and I'm still here. She doesn't seem too happy about it. I haven't been asked to leave straight to my face yet, but it's been strongly implied that I need to move on. 

My car- which was my Plan B- broke down and needs an expensive repair. I can't couch surf without a vehicle cuz everyone I know lives all over Los Angles and Orange Counties in California. I've applied for emergency Section 8 and who knows when I'll hear from them. (I have a PO Box so I've got a mailing address.) The place I'm staying has banned my childrens' father from coming inside since he was abusive. His ego got hurt and now he's banned my children from coming here. I have class at times when I could have my children. So, no staying the night and whatnot. (I realize he's being unreasonable, he's trying to control me through my kids-pretty shitty.) There's no fear for their safety here.

On another note, I've been looking for housing I can afford. So I applied to my school's housing program, but I'm too old to utilize that resource. I've tried CL since I get a little bit from financial aid and it's all full of people who want the gfe (girlfriend experience) to a creepy level. I've tried to get housing from a shelters and I'm not getting anywhere with my social worker or the shelters. No one is calling/emailing me back. I've used 211 to find these resources. 

I'm getting to a point where I feel hopeless. I'm at a loss of resources. What else can I do?  


TL;DR: Homeless in Los Angeles County, CA; kicked out of the house from an abusive relationship. Kids' dad is being unreasonable. I need leave where I'm staying, by car doesn't work. Community resources aren't panning out. What else can I do?",2020-09-19 14:49:26,2020,9,19,14,49,26

ipwqai,92,mtempissmith,11,homeless,Street Homeless Tip,"I'm sure that many of you who have been street homeless know how easily it is to get hassled for having a few belongings on the street and how flimsy those wheeled shopping carts are unless you want to spend nearly $100 on one. 

Public places like libraries used to give me a really hard time because I had a cat and a backpack and sometimes a sleeping roll and little cooler with me. No matter how little I packed they would give me trouble because they could tell I was homeless from some of what I was carrying. I was always washed, neat, presentable but my possessions often gave me away. 

My solution was to change wheels. I picked up a $300 stroller for like $25 at a church thrift store. It had a diaoer bag on the handles, way better tires and a rain cover. 

Once I got that the roll would be stashed behind the seat and my cat's soft carrier and little snap lidded cat box would dissapear onto the stroller seat under the cover. 

My backpack and mini cooler would stow underneath and I would stow the rest in the diaper bag as needed. Put the rain cover down and nobody took too close a look at my stuff anymore. 

Most of the time people just assumed I had a baby with me and places that had formerly barred me from coming in with my shopping cart would let me stroll right in. 

What could they say?

My cat is a support animal and she was so well trained that people would seldom realize she was with me. She would actually sit in the carrier leashed,  top unzipped and be perfectly happy while I did my thing in the library. 

The one library I used had conference nooks where you could sit by yourself and the librarian was cool with cats and let me let her roam so long as she used her traveling box and behaved which she did. That lady was awesome. She even let me take a nap sitting once in a while and brought me cans for my cat. 

The stroller thing made for a much easier walk around and much less hassling from guards in stores and that. It also kept my stuff dry and a bit safer when I was rolling. I could lock stuff to the stroller and lock the stroller cover and lock the stroller to something and not risk losing my stuff as easily. Much easier than with the shopping cart. It was way sturdier and rolled way better than a shopping cart and ultimately turned out to be a lot more discreet too.",2020-09-09 22:46:51,2020,9,9,22,46,51

I haven't posted in a while, but have been reading everything on here and remain thankful for this sub and all your stories, observations and advice/suggestions. Earlier in the summer, I was really struggling with being stuck out in the heat, humidity, rain, sun and being eaten alive by mosquitoes. (The heat index here is going to be 109 today and we got 8 inches of rain yesterday). I was having a hard time finding any place to go inside, and couldn't get online anywhere either because of the libraries being closed. I had posted how bad it was, and a few people reached out to me with offers to help. I am truly grateful for that. One of those people sent me this link and told me that Panera Bread was running a promotion and that I could get free coffee.

[https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html?ref=COFFEE712624](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html?ref=COFFEE712624)

This has been a life-changing thing for me.  It solved a lot of those problems. It allows me not only to get unlimited FREE coffee, tea or iced coffee, but I have been able to sit inside, plug everything in, get charged-up, use the restroom, wash my hands, get online and stay for like 4 or 5 hours at a time. I sometimes go back later on or in the evening when different people are working because I don't want to ruin a good thing by over-staying or camping out all day.

The people who work at my local Panera have been really nice to me and I try really hard to not look homeless or cause any problems. Just sit quietly, drink, and get online. So if you sign-up, please don't cause your local employees any trouble or make a mess. Most of these people are not getting paid much and have to deal with wearing masks, asshole customers, and the whole Covid stress all day while they are at work.

I wanted to make sure that you guys knew about it because I think the sign-up period ends in the next couple of days. If you just go to the Panera website and sign up from there, the deal will end on this Monday, 9/7. But if you use the link I included, you get the deal until your renewal date in November. That is 2 months for free. After the free period ends, I am still going to keep it because it is only 30 cents a day - and once it is cold outside - if the libraries and other places are still closed, it will be worth that for me. I already have the extended deal but figured I would post the link I used here so that anyone else who is homeless could get it. Like I said, it has pretty much saved my life these last few weeks. I hope it helps some other people since I know there are Paneras pretty much everywhere.

NOTE: You need a credit card to sign up but you won't get charged if you cancel before your November renewal date. Read the terms and conditions on the website if you have any questions.

Stay safe.

Edit: Not to state the obvious, but signing up for this changes you from someone who is just hanging out there because they are homeless - into a legit customer - even if you don't spend anything. ",2020-09-02 07:45:27,2020,9,2,7,45,27

ijnpky,185,dumpsterdumpling99,35,homeless,Homeless for 9 mos and counting. Here's what I learned,"I've been homeless since thanksgiving of last year and it's been horrible BUT I have learned a few things that have helped me. PLEASE NOTE: These may not work for everyone.

1. Switch your sleeping schedule. I started finding places to sleep during the day and I'm up at night. It's helped me stay relatively safe and people are often to consumed with their own day to bug you.

2. Start getting mental health help IMMEDIATELY. Even if you don't think you need it, you can get your name bumped up on many waiting lists by being a mental patient. I actually suffer from major depressive disorder so some days when I feel like I've had enough exposure or I feel unsafe I go to the crisis unit. If anything they'll give you food and calm place to sleep for a few days.

3. Pack light. Invest in a storage. Keep extra underwear and socks. Also invest in sunscreen! 

4. Trust no one. Camps are rarely safe for men and women alike and weirdos cruise through camps looking for people new to the streets to take advantage of. Women and female presenting peeps: be careful around OTHER women. Human  trafficking is skyrocketing rn and traffickers often use other women to pick up victims to make them feel safe. I promise you will be better off on your own

5. If you are able, get camping gear. Anything solar powered is going to be your best friend especially since everything is closed to pedestrians due to COVID.

6. Swallow your pride. This most likely will be the hardest thing at least it was for me. The first step to realizing your own strength is to first realize that you are human who now has to sleep outside. Don't be afraid to ask for help from wherever and whoever you deem safe.

7. Find joy where ever you can. Homelessness is bleak. Especially during a pandemic. If you have the funds, treat yourself at least once a day. 

8. Find a still body of water and try to camp near it. Try to stay away from anything with a current or anything you can't see the bottom of. Maybe go for a night swim if you feel up to it. Its great exercise and this is also a good place to shower and potty. Kinda gross but hey you gotta do what you gotta do.

9. Remember that this won't last for ever. You'll get through this. You'll be stronger than most and you'll have a million stories to tell. We all have a primal urge to survive and your gut is always with you. You WILL get through this.

this is just everything I can remeber off the top of my head. if anyone has any other tips or better tips please let me know because I'm still homeless lmao. blessings to everyone reading this ♡

ic6zme,106,theforestcellar,10,homeless,The goose,"On Sunday I received a free lunch and walked down to the Waterfront Park to eat. There are a bunch of Canadian geese I like to watch go about their lives.

I spotted a goose with plastic hanging out it's beak, so I slowly approached, trying not to startle him or her. It kept trying to munch on this plastic so I gave calm prompts to not eat that. The goose thought I was crazy, probably onlookers too, but I slowly followed this goose talking to it for a time until it coughed up an entire zip lock bag. I snatched it up quickly.

There was some bit of food the goose was trying to unsuccessfully get at and was thorough displeased I stole it's deadly prize. I located the rest of discarded trash, making further geese enemies and left them in peace to plot their revenge.

It was a moment of perspective for me. Had I not been there, which is all tied up in my homeless situation this goose may have died. It's been hard navigating this new life, but I love wildlife and to be able to help in any way has been very meaningful to me.

i7rkom,146,Rudi24401,9,homeless,Off The Streets Finally!!,"I came out here to Southern California from Florida after covid ruined my job prospects and finances back at the end of April. I had been living, hiding really, in the attic area of a detached garage of an empty house being renovated. It was an okay place, well venilated, had electricity, was hidden and out of sight, and a clean place to stay at. Most importantly, its free. 

I've been working alot lately, working 2 jobs. Waiting tables at one place, and walking around distrubting flyers for another guy. Between the two jobs, I've been making $800-900 a week, and have been able to save most of that for the past month or so. I've finally got about $4000 or so saved up, so yesterday, I rented a room. Its in a shared house with like 10 othet people, and I have to share a room, but shit, my rent is only $400 a month- probably the cheapest rent anyone is paying in LA!! I'll be moving my stuff in today. So ya, I am no longer homeless, after having lived rough for the last 3 months or so. 

I've had my ups and downs these past few months, probably more downs than ups. But life is getting itself on track, a little at a time. I managed to survive this shit, being homeless agaim, catching covid, sleeping surrounded by a hundred black widows. A man can be down and out, but if you bust your ass, work hard, grab opportunities that arise no matter how small those opportunities might be, and stay sober, one can make it out of this kind of life. 

To those others on this forum that are still sleeping outside, to those finding yourselves about to become homeless, to those who are lacking in hope.... keep fighting. Keep trying. Keep working. In time, your day too will come.",2020-08-11 07:13:16,2020,8,11,7,13,16

i2ku1d,297,whale_lover,128,homeless,I'm a long term homeless rights organizer with an org that does direct outreach/aid to the homeless near Skid Row. Please stop giving newly homeless folks bad advice.,"If you're not homeless/ex-homeless and you're on here, chances are its because you care. Thank you for that. But one has to come to realize that hearing about homelessness second hand through media, crime blotter articles, and Facebook comment complaints about encampments has molded your mind to perceive homeless people and its solutions a certain way. Also if you've never lived in poverty, you also probably don't have an accurate view of the way the American ""social safety net"" works. Reality; It doesn't. 

My perspective comes from years of working with the unhoused community and getting to know a lot of them over the years. 

Just off the top of my head: 

I've seen people respond to folks seeking advice with ""Call the cops, they'll help you and get you the help you need."" which is just an absurdly privileged statement. A lot of cops treat homeless people like sub-human shit. They are often harmful and downright dangerous to the homeless. The LAPD was discovered to have a label for prositutes and homeless people found dead. ""NHI: No Humans Involved."" It's often the police that sweep them and take all of their property and destroy it, to get them to move along to where people don't have to look at them. They also don't care when they're victims of crime. We see how the police treat housed people, imagine being a part of a group of people who is looked down upon by all society and has literally zero resources to advocate for themselves.   

I see people here telling people to just get on Section 8. The waitlist in LA and San Fransisco is 15+ years or so. A lot of counties are so underfunded and overburdened by the amount of demand that they're not even taking new applications. A lot of the homeless are on those waiting lists right now. Nevermind that a ton of landlords flat out don't accept the subsidy as a form of payment. 

I've seen people posting that they do not believe in giving unhoused people money. You do realize that unhoused people need things other than an occasional restaurant meal right? Some have food allergies, some need shoes, some need medicine, some need tents and a blanket, or to spend money on a drink at Starbucks so that they can sit in the AC when it's 110 degrees, and yes- some have addictions with no access to treatment/detox (also of those that do drugs, most of them started doing drugs once on the street to deal with the horrors of homelessness). If you're selflessly looking for a way to give - give cash. 

500,000 people are homeless right now in the US, and that number is about to grow exponentially - through no personal fault of those people. This is a systemic problem. This is a problem in both Democratic and Republican states. There are a ton more examples I could give, but I would just really like to tell people that even though they mean well - reality often looks a lot different.",2020-08-02 16:09:17,2020,8,2,16,9,17

hyvty1,119,Plagman39339,45,homeless,I got out of homelessness 2 years ago and I'm so grateful. Here's my story. What's yours?,"10 years ago, my meth addiction got the best of me. My family gave up on me and I bounced between homeless shelters.

Almost 3 years ago, after trying to get clean over and over again, I did what NA tells you not to do and I ran away to a bigger city with a bigger homeless shelter and a recovery program. I never completed the recovery program, too much religion and not enough recovery. I got kicked out several times, but I kept my sobriety through it all.

2 summers ago, I again did what they told me I shouldn't do and I got a job while limping into my glow-in-the-dark (1 year NA keytag). It was just a temp job at the state fair, but as hard as it was and wow, was it hard, I persisted. 

Then since I was kicked out of the recovery program anyway, I started applying for other jobs. I thought I might end up working fast food, my dream job was Starbucks, but I applied for a job that I never thought I would get. A job that I had the experience for, but I couldn't explain the gap in my employment history. To my surprise, I glossed over the employment gaps, focused on my strengths, and I was hired. 

Before I knew it, I was working in a call center for a major company and I was surrounded by people with real world problems. It was so bizarre. Going to training during the day, and sleeping in a homeless shelter at night. I finally got that glow in the dark during training. 

Now almost 2 years later, I have an apartment, I have savings, I have relationships with my family, etc. Obviously I don't talk a lot about it to work people. I want to be normal, but a decade in homeless shelters affected me. I'm not quite back to who I once was, and I don't know they I will ever be, but I'm grateful for the experiences that I had. They shaped who I am today for better or worse, and I for the first time ever, I like who I am.

hu2dx9,130,DJ44x,82,homeless,I am not going to survive this heat,"Heat index supposed to be near 112 today. It has been so bad, that I can't sleep, can't eat, can't stay hydrated no matter how much I drink. I am soaking, dripping wet 24 hours a day.  I get nauseous if I try to eat anything and the calories just make me hotter, so I am starving myself trying to keep that from happening. If I try to stay in the shade to stay cool, I just get eaten alive my thousands of mosquitoes, so I try to keep my whole body covered - but that doesn't work either. I have my whole lower half wrapped in a sheet,  but the only long-sleeve shirt I have is a flannel thing that I only wear in the winter. I am getting weaker and more dizzy and light-headed and I have searched for some alternative to the LIBRARIES and COMMUNITY CENTERS that have kept this from being a problem in past summers - but they are all closed and as far as I can tell, no place in Raleigh, or NC has opened any COOLING CENTERS for this heatwave like they had previously done. I found this article when searching, and it had this quote:

 \[Weather like this disproportionally affects the vulnerable: people without the means to buy an air conditioner or crank it up to full blast. Many cities have typically had cooling centers, where people can get out of the heat, often in places like community recreation centers. The coronavirus has introduced complications, Lara said, because the city’s cooling centers now require visitors to maintain social distancing and to wear masks. “You don’t want to cram 30 people into a room and call it a cooling center,” he said.

In Maricopa County, Arizona, county spokesman Ron Coleman said the county has added to its collection of daytime cooling stations and land set aside for homeless people to pitch tents where they can have access to hand washing stations and portable toilets. The county has also opened a temporary overnight cooling shelter, and for those who appear to be at high risk for the coronavirus or who may have been exposed, the county has more than 200 hotel rooms “so we can have those individuals out of the heat and away from the congregate living,” he said. \]

Nothing about hotel rooms around here. I guess I am just supposed to die.",2020-07-19 09:35:17,2020,7,19,9,35,17

hhw6uy,0,Big_OG_Homeless,1,homeless,Big OG's guide to homelessness part 2: Homeless with a kid!,"BIG OG homeless back with another handy how-to guide on how to survive homelessness. In our last installment we discussed all the ways you could possibly get out of homelessness by using/manipulating- er, I mean utilizing your human resources like your girlfriend or her parents but now we face a different issue: You got a kid and you know what that means: instead of taking steps in real life to handle a situation that is ultimately in your hands to solve, we're gonna turn to anonymous strangers on the internet for advice instead of trying to get a grasp on this very real and scary situation! Before we get into it though, let's just take a moment to thank god that your kid is likely totally unaware that you've left their fate up to the advice you receive from an internet forum as that fact would likely scare them more than the actual reality of their situation!

So here you are, no-shit on the street with another human life utterly dependent on you! Whats the first thing we should do in this scenario? Should we immediately seek a shelter? Should we try to contact a church so they can provide assistance in getting the child under a roof and fed as soon as possible? Should you **be a fucking man** **and take control of the situation for the sake of your child?** Should you do LITERALLY ANYTHING besides take a selfie and make a post on reddit about you being homeless and subjecting your child to this horror? HELL NAH! We finnah take selfies and post em on reddit, so here's how to take the best selfie for the homeless subreddit!

Step one: Smile! Sure you may be in literally the worst possible situation a parent can be in and you should be panicking and scrambling to try and provide for the welfare of that tiny human life you've created but hey, you can't let that bring you down. By smiling in our reddit selfie, we can show the world that despite your failure to take appropriate measures in getting your kid the hell out of that situation as soon as possible, you're still keeping your chin up!

&#x200B;

Step two: Get the kid and her mom in the selfie! Sure, while we may not be asking outright for financial assistance in our actual homeless selfie reddit post, including the kid in the picture might illicit just the right amount of sympathy to get TONS of people to message you offering to give you money! Think of all the righteous bucks you can make if you make it seem like you desperately need money for a disenfranchised child without actually outright asking for it! Damn, you're smart! Sure, some people might call taking a picture of a child who's living on the street outright shameful and **downright exploitative** but who cares what those HATERS think? Only God can judge you, yo! The internet was there for you when you needed tips on how to make the best home made bong, when you wanted to jack off to anime cat girls and now they're gonna be there to help you recover from your failure to provide a decent life for your child! Hey, thanks for the gold kind stranger! Bless up!

&#x200B;

It's as simple as that! Being homeless with a kid is one of the worst situations you can find yourself in but as you can see from my handy guide, the best way to help that child isn't to get your ass off the phone/computer and go as quickly as you can to a safe place that will offer you and your family assistance but to take a selfie of you smiling broadly, with your girlfriend and child playing on the side of the road in the frame and then spend hours replying to strangers on the internet about all the ways you could hypothetically be improving your situation without actually doing anything! *Adulting is haaaard!*",2020-06-29 02:34:24,2020,6,29,2,34,24

he1k68,111,CesarV,33,homeless,"Wilderness backpacker with nearly 25 years of experience here. Just looking to help out with my knowledge of camping, nature, survival, etc. AMA.","Hello all, not homeless and never have been, but want to help out. In the past I have reached out to people looking for help on reddit with my knowledge from my hobby, and I've also reached out to a few other communities here to see if anyone would want to learn more or pick my brain on the subject of backpacking.  And I've been able to help a few people and it has encouraged me to keep it going. It only occurred to me today to come to this sub and that maybe my know-how could help out here. And just in case anyone might think I have any hidden agenda, like I am just looking for clicks on my blog or views on my Youtube channel or whatever, know that this is not the case. While I do have a blog and Youtube channel devoted to backpacking, and might link to them to help answer questions or comments, neither one have ads and I literally make no money on them--and they are not very popular anyhow. 

Let me try and get some basics out of the way that people who have little to no experience sleeping outside ask me about for those of you that are perhaps close to being homeless, maybe living your car and want more space, etc. Some backpacking skills apply no matter where you're sleeping, be it in the city, suburbs, or out in the woods. So I'll try and stick to those general good pieces of advice that apply pretty much anytime you sleep outside (with some exceptions of course).

Staying warm. If you are having trouble staying warm while sleeping at night, you not only need more insulation, but the right kind of insulation. Read the tags on your clothing to figure out what kind of fabric it is, for example. Avoid cotton. Cotton is not good at keeping you warm.  Just trust me and the majority of experienced backpackers on this: cotton in general sucks when you're out roughing it (with some exceptions like tropical weather). Wear polyester, nylon, and wool clothing--or down feather insulation if you can get it (but down is usually expensive). Also, having multiple layers traps heat better than say one or two (even if they are thicker than several thin layers). For example, when I sit around camp at say 32F/0C to be warm I'd wear: base layers (polyester or wool), polyester or nylon shirt and pants, a thin polyester hoody, a synthetic insulated jacket, and a polyester wind jacket as my shell layer (plus a rain poncho or jacket and rain pants if needed--Frogg Toggs are cheap and not bad). If you don't have any try and scrape some dough together to buy some decent layers at a 2nd hand store.  

2nd hand stores like Goodwill and such will also sometimes have sleeping bags and blankets. Again, read the labels of the bags or blankets you have or are looking to buy. Some cheap-o bags have cotton liners on the inside or even in the insulation. You also want to make sure to sleep on top of some kind of insulation. Foam sleeping mats are cheap, you can get one at Walmart for like 10 bucks, and you can sleep on more than one to be warmer and more comfy.  You can also use improvised insulation like a few garbage bags stuffed full of leaves, moss, grass, cardboard, etc. But a lot of body heat is lost to the ground you sleep on, so get as much as you can under you. And also remember that cold air sinks, so try and avoid sleeping down low and especially close to bodies of water if you want to be warmer.

Cooking outside. You can make your own stove to cook meals that are really cheap. Search for videos on Youtube on how to make an alcohol (the ""cat can stove"" is a good one) or wood stove (also called ""hobo stove"") yourself. You can make them out of recycled cans, like say a can of beans. They are fairly easy to make and you don't need that many tools or the tools can be improvised. You can buy alcohol (denatured alcohol, not rubbing alcohol) for fuel for fairly cheap at hardware stores or at gas stations/car stores (for example: bottles of Heet). Or you can get fuel free for a wood stove, and I've even cooked meals on wood stoves using only balls of newspaper (but it's not ideal, of course). 

Get a metal pot and spoon then do another Youtube search for backpacking recipes. A bag of lentils and a bag of rice can be cheaper than a meal at a fast food joint, and it's healthier and you'll get more meals out of them too. You can score free packs of condiments at fast food joints to help your meals, even if it's some salt and pepper packs it makes a big difference. A big bag of oatmeal will be many breakfasts for you, to take another good example, and you can score sugar packs easy. Some places even have honey and apple butter packs for free that you can mix into your oatmeal. And of course everyone knows about ramen noodles, and keep in mind that you can add lots of other stuff to them for more calories/nutrients (like: can of tuna or sardines, an egg, spoonful of peanut butter, etc.).

You don't need a tent. Obviously it can be a nice option, but you can also sleep under a tarp, which is a cheaper option that also has certain benefits (lighter, less bulky, flexible to use, etc.). You can buy a heavy-duty plastic tarp from a hardware store or online for cheap along with some nylon cord or paracord to pitch it. You can buy long nails at a hardware store to use as tent stakes and they will be cheaper and tougher (but heavier). You can even make a tarp out of plastic or Tyvek sheets that can be found in dumpsters or bought for cheap. But of course plastic sheets can get damaged easy and Tyvek is not 100% waterproof after it rains for a while. To help a DIY plastic or Tyvek tarp be tougher, more water proof, and also help you be slightly warmer, you can buy a space blanket (these are super cheap, like 5 bucks or so) and duct tape or glue it to the inside of the tarp. The space blanket will reflect some of your body heat back at you, or if you have a fire close to your shelter it will reflect a lot of that heat to you. If you're in the city and already sleeping in a tent, this can also help if it leaks, but in this case I'd tie and/or glue the space blanket on the outside and top of the tent.

If you are interested in a step-by-step guide to making a plastic tarp I can link to an article I wrote about it on my blog in the comments below. For solo camping a 7x9ft tarp is what I often use and it's plenty of space, but a 8x10ft tarp for one is huge for one and not bad for two. Search for videos on Youtube on how to pitch tarps if you are unfamiliar with how that works. The first few times might be tricky, but it's easy after that. You only need a few sticks or a few trees or one stick and one tree to pitch a good A-frame shelter. Or if you're in the city any two strong anchor points will do: street signs, lamp posts, benches, etc.

To keep bugs, mice, slugs, etc. off you while you sleep under a tarp there are also solutions. You can try and find a mosquito net or net tent or bivy, cheaper options do exist. You can even buy the cheapest of cheap tents knowing full well it ain't going to be very waterproof, but it should at least be bug proof and then you can pitch the tarp over it. Plenty of used tents and shelters to be found on reddit and facebook if you search around. Or you can get a head net for even cheaper and make sure to zip up your sleeping bag all the way. Helps if you wear a baseball cap to sleep to keep the net off your face.

Line your backpack with a garbage bag to keep everything inside dry if/when it rains.

Google campsites and/or nature reserves in your area to find places to camp, and also look into marked hiking trails close to where you're at.  If you don't have a car you can hitchhike there, but of course use common sense and be safe. You may also want to Google ""stealth camping"" and learn more about that.

Way less cops out in the woods, just sayin'.

hcagyf,1,jessh86,20,homeless,"While trying to help my Fiancee's homless family with 2 teen kids get there living situation cleaned up and suitable for living. I got beat up and to top it off, CPS didn't help and calling the Authorities didn't help or do anything at all either.","  Hi, I'm a 33 year old female that lives in Sothern California and I have been trying to help my Fiancee's homless mother, father and 2 kids, a 15 year old girl and a 17 year old boy find housing while they are currently living out of 2 filthy, hordered, trash, cockroach and other bug infested vans for about 5 years now. The reason they are homless is because they got kicked out of their last apartment for loud fighting all the time and the father was spending most there money on alcohol and prostitution. The whole family is in denial about the prostitution but my Fiancee has proof this is the case. His father also had a stroke last year so he is disabled and can't work as a mobal mechanic and kind of support his family anymore...  They are a Mexican family and the mother and father are illegal immigrants from Mexico. They have no pappers and will not get them. The mother has never worked and has some severe hoarding issues. (Like the stuff you see on tye tv show, ""Hoarders."" ) She does some nasty stuff and yes I believe it has to do with mental health issues but thats my opinion and I am not a doctor and I would never judge her for that I would love to see her get some help, the same with the dad and his issues...
 Anyway, my Fiancee has been living with me rent free on and off for 2 years then officially he has moved in with me still rent free for the last 2 years, so 4 years total he has been living with me. and we take his younger brother who's 17 now and sometimes his younger sister who's now 15,  in sometimes so they have a roof over their head, a shower and some homemade hot food on the weekends...And I don't ask for anything in return. I'm  just happy to help and when I am able to I will do anything to help my Fiancee or anyone in need.
 Besides trying to help them find housing, my Fiancee and I have been asking them for a year now to clean out the vans that they are living in and they just keep adding junk to them and not doing what we are asking of them when they don't have anything else to do... seriously... One of the vans belongs to my Fiancee that he lent them to SLEEP in so they have more space for all of them to SLEEP. But the mom just keeps adding more junk and food that goes bad to van and now there is no space to sleep. So they sleep sitting up. Both vans are cockroach infested and they keep spraying pesticide in the van so there are millions of dead and alive ones in the vans and food and the father keeps getting sick and has been going to the hospital frequenting after his stroke last year. Since I told them a while back I would call CPS if they didn't clean out the vans and they didn't so i did call CPS about 6 months ago and CPS didn't do shit. To this day my Fiancee's parents still haven't taken the threat seriously and last Saturday I put my foot down and spoke to them over the phone since they wont listen to my Fiancee, (their son,) or anyone at all and told them, "" look, if you don't clean out both vans and do what we ask as owners of the van I will call the authorities and have them take a look at your living situation and they can do what they need to do to get these kids safe.. And we will also be taking back the van we let them barrow if nothing is clean... "" So we gave them till last Sunday at 5pm. 
  As Sunday rolls around to 5pm we head over to where they always park the vans and they were still filthy and nasty with cockroaches everywhere and still in the food. My Fioncee and I were prepared to cockroache bomb the 2 vans right then and there to help them, if they had cleaned it all out. Well it wasn't clean at all. So I told them I was calling the Authorities to do their part because they have 2 underage teens living like this and we have been asking them for about a year now to get things clean. I only did this because I want the best for these kids. They don't deserve to live in these conditions especially when there is a deadly virus going around and homless people are more susceptible to getting the virus. Anyway, my Fiancee's other sister who is 21 (and has her own place and a very young daughter.) came to see what was going on and she just started beating me up there in front of a ton of people including her underage siblings because, ""It was none my business...."" (Idiot... the cops were already on their way before she beat me anddddd she has a young child... she could have gotten arrested and her child taken away for doing this to me.) I am 33 years old and I have not once in my whole life ever been in a physical fight and would never start a fight in general. I never associat myself with trashy people who think physical fighting is the answer.  I don't think she realizes I took her older brother (My Fioncee now,) in when he was homless 4 years ago and i take care of her teen brother on the weekends and sometimes her teen sister. And did I forget to mention, I got a bunch of cockroaches in my apartment from the younger brother coming to spend the night a while back and I know it was him because he admitted to my Fioncee he was the one who brought them in. So It is my business. These people made it my business when they started asking me take care of their teen children on the weekends.
  So, when the cops came about 15min after she let up off of beating me up and my face was all bloody but that wasn't what I cared about. I was more worried about these kids than my face so i didn't press charges when the cops asked me if I wanted to so they didn't  arrest her. That wasnt the reason I called the Authorities in the firat place so I'm  not going to let her beating me up distract me from what really needs to be done here. Now that the cops were there they looked in their vans and told me there is nothing they can do and it is not illegal to live that way.... WTF!!!! Someone tell me this is just wrong! Or should I have really just really minded my own business so I didn't have to get my face and body beat up? 
 OH, and yes we deffinatly took the van that we let them barrow away after all this and we are cleaning it ourselves and preparing to sell it. so now the mother that was so terrified to clean the vans because she didn't want to loose anything,  is now out of everything in the van we took back. All we can do now since they have nothing of ours anymore is just not have anything to do with them anymore, not lend them any more money or anything anymore, ignore the hate and just pray for them, that they will want to get help someday.

I would like your opinion on what I should do now or what not to do and should I have pressed charges against the 21 year old sister? Should I or is it too late?  I feel like now I should have because she made me loose my brand new engagment ring my Fiancee just got me while she was beating me up. Let me know what you think about all this.

I will soon be homeless and I don't plan to stay at shelters.

I have a place in Belltown. Usually I rent out my extra bedrooms on airbnb but with Covid going on, all my reservations have been canceled and no one is booking right now. So two rooms are just sitting there, empty. 

I saw a person in Sculpture Park the other day who was bathing in the (freezing) water. We ended up chatting and I offered up my place for a hot shower and a bed for a night. She ended up staying a couple nights and then took a bus to Portland. It felt good, human, to help. I also see a guy bathing there on a regular basis but I've never had a chance to converse with him. I've thought about bringing him a better towel but felt it might be weird? 

I also remember being 17 and needing a place for my mom and I to shelter in (escape really) for a week or so. I was lucky to have friends step in and help at the time. 

Anyways, if I can help, I'd like to. If you need a shower or a place to lay your head, please reach out. It would have to be temporary (a night or two) and safe but hoping it's better than nothing.

gxeipi,117,MrsDirtbag,17,homeless,First night indoors,"Signed my lease and moved in yesterday. Well more or less. I didn’t bring my mattress from my tent so I don’t have a bed yet. I don’t really have any furniture in the apartment yet until I go to my storage unit later. It’s kind of funny, in the tent we had a premium king size mattress that we found behind a swank hotel that was being renovated but our first night indoors we slept on blankets on the floor. We totally didn’t care, the A/C and lack of bugs made it feel luxurious!

I just finished a shopping spree at the dollar store getting tons of household essentials and cleaning supplies. I have OCD (the actual disorder) so I’m very excited to get back home and dismantle my kitchen cabinets and thoroughly clean them 😁 My housing worker was laughing at me because the first thing I got for the new place was a vacuum. I guess he was expecting me to get something more “fun” but I told him a vacuum was something I  could never have in a tent so getting one totally made me feel like I had arrived. 

Yesterday after we signed the lease I went to the apartment to drop off some things and plug in some chargers. As I got ready to leave to go help my boyfriend get stuff at the tent I thought “I better put the bag of chargers and other things I left behind the bedroom door.” It made me smile because I realized I didn’t have to do that anymore. 

This process has given me some insights into some of the challenges with housing the homeless, since we do get a fair amount of outreach and other workers on here I plan to make a post about that in a little bit. Stay safe y’all!",2020-06-05 16:25:05,2020,6,5,16,25,5

gw82nb,105,gthaatar,25,homeless,"Some helpful tips if you are about to be, or fear you might, be homeless.","Yes this is a long post. Not TL;DRing it. Reading wont kill you. 

So I am a homeless person; more specifically a chronically homeless person. I've been living out of my vehicle for the past four years with two brief periods where I did have an apartment, but lost them due to job instability. After losing the second one, I have since resolved to focus on school so I can eventually get into a stable job and/or career, likely after Ive left my current city (was going to be like, right now that I was going to do so but COVID19 screwed that plan sideways).

But, in my time I've learned and experienced a lot, and contrary to what most would assume the experience was more beneficial to me than detrimental. I am, very literally not the same person I was before I slept in my truck for the first time and that is a wholly good thing. 

That being said, the most poignant thing I ever realized is that while no one can tell you what homelessness is like unless theyve been through it themselves, no one person can encapsulate the experience either. 

So take my advice with a grain of salt if you must. I will say upfront that my true #1 tip is to avoid being homeless at all costs, but given current and potential future events, I think its prudent to give people some way to put their minds at ease. 

====
Tips:

1. Maintain some kind of income - it sounds counterintuitive, but having an income is the first priority you should have. Without an income, you'll be overly reliant on shelters and food banks, and ultimately I can tell you that even in nice cities these places *suck*. Unless you have no choice, I cannot ever recommend bothering with these places. It is not worth it. 

That being said, in the coming uncertain times, who knows how one might be able to maintain an income. Im personally running on scholarships and student loans at this time, though I hope to supplement it with an actual job soon, because duh. I have certain plans and Im going to need all the income I can get. 

 But you have to do something, because if nothing else it will keep you going and keep you focused. 

2. Prepare for the unending boredom. Most people will assume the hardest or scariest parts of being homeless is sleeping in public or even starving. But the reality is for most that the boredom is what will break you. 

Without the comfort of a typical home, it can be difficult to maintain the same level of stimulation one is used to, and this gets worse the less you actually have to do in a day. When you see homeless addicts, often times its the boredom that made them addicts, not the addiction that made them homeless. Thats not everyones story (again, no one person; I personally have never taken drugs and rarely drink), but it is a clear example of how bad it gets. 

As to how you combat boredom, the most crucial thing I think is having a modern smartphone. They can be relatively inexpensive to acquire, and if you have an income and can afford it, an unlimited data plan is going to be a massive comfort. Having said income can also potentially buy you access to streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, etc. I personally also recommend Youtube Premium, as having an ad free Youtube is awesome plus you can actually have videos playing in your phones background, allowing you to multitask and use it for music without having to leave your screen on, draining precious power. 

Developing a hobby or multiple hobbies (I cook and still have a gaming computer from the before times; havent been able to use it much lately though) will also help, and if you decide to go to school or already are, putting extra effort into that will also help. 

3. Dealing with power. During lockdown, it was difficult for me to keep my phone turned on without wasting gas on driving around so I didnt drain my battery (you will kill your battery if you rely on it to charge your phone without driving around. Its fine in a pinch, but try not to use it too much without plenty of driving it accompany it). I ended up buying a fold up, 28 watt solar panel and a handheld battery bank. This combo worked, but you are at the mercy of the weather and it does force you to have the panel at least in full sunlight to get any appreciable amount of power out of it. Not always fun for me here in Florida. The battery bank itself is recommended however as it makes life a lot easier. 

But presumably we wont have to be on lockdown forever, or may be at least not again anyway. So, best way to charge your stuff is to rely on places where you can charge your stuff. In my area currently those are only really libraries, but in normal circumstances one can also rely on McDonalds and potentially other fast food places that keep their dining room open late or preferably 24/7. 

4. Dont be an asshole. This is good life advice in general, but if youre hanging out at a McDonalds or a library for the better part of the day, dont ruin it for yourself or others by being a dick. Always clean after yourself, dont bother other patrons or customers, and if you can dont pile up your crap all over an empty table. Ive seen people get kicked out, arrested, or worse all because of this stupid ass behavior. So, dont be an asshole. You ruin for others who may also rely on that library or McDs when you do that. 

5. Sleeping. First off, forget your instincts, dont sleep in a residential area. Karen *will* fuck you over the moment she sees your strange car parked on the curb. Likewise, dont pick a dark, vacant lot to sleep in either, as thats cop bait. 

Instead, find a large parking lot that hosts a 24/7 business. The obvious ones are McDonalds and Walmart, but you can also potentially try call centers, warehouses, etc. Anywhere with a lot of cars and a lot of people that come and go. 

And the same #4 rules apply. Dont be an asshole. Dont litter, dont bother people, and depending on the place, leave when you no longer need to be there.

Now obviously, not everyone is going to have a car. While I dont have a lot of tips for someone that doesn't, I can say that it is a case where you may want to lean on a shelter, but I have also seen people successfully keep a tent on them and sleep in the woods. I have heard horror stories about camping with other homeless people though, so unless you know and trust the people around you, Id try to stay isolated.

6. Hygeine. If you have an income, gyms are your friend. Not only can it help with the boredom aspect, but its a hot shower and a place to go if you just need somewhere safe to sit for a while or to get out of the heat/cold. 

If that isnt viable (or certain events preclude it as a possiblity) then you want to rely on bird baths and wipes. Bird baths are essentially a nice way of saying bathe using the bathroom sink. 

But again, dont be an asshole. Be quick as possible, *always* do it in the handicap stall, and for the love of god clean up any mess. For speed, it helps to just focus in problem areas (face, pits, crotch) and save anything else for when they need a serious cleaning.

In between these baths, rely on wipes. In camping sections at Walmart you can find these things called DudeWipes (or something similar) that work okay, but run out fast, smell weird, and fall apart. So Id recommend whatever the highest quality of baby wipes you can afford. 

And very importantly, dont neglect your mouth. A bag of floss sticks is inexpensive, and you dont even need a sink to brush. You'll thank me later when you arent writhing in pain at 3am in a walmart parking lot because you couldnt be bothered. 

7. Food. As noted, and as youll see if you poke around my profile, I cook. A lot. Its something I first did for myself about a year in, and it really does help you not only maintain a bit of sanity, but being able to cook for yourself is very forgiving to your wasteline. It does obviously require an income, and substantial funds to get started depending on how far you want to take it, but once its established its an effective way to go. 

If anyone wants a more indepth detailing of my set up, budget, etc lemme know and Ill write it out. It can potentially be as long as this post ends up being. 

But, presuming you cant or arent interested in doing these things, you do have other options besides the relatively expensive ordeal of just eating out all the time. 

Stowable dry goods like ramen cups, cans of soup, beans, etc are obvious choices and some gas stations (Circle Ks in my area) still offer public microwaves, so all you need is a bowl or tupperware. For canned stuff you can also just eat it cold if you have little option or just dont mind misery. 

Likewise on the misery side of things, peanut butter. For a small period I lived on nothing but spoonfuls of peanut butter. I cant recommend it, but it works. Get chunky, trust me. You can jazz that up by also getting bread, jelly, etc. 

On the less miserable side of things, raw produce. Something I did for a while was to essentially make my own chunky salsa by just cutting up vegetables and mixing together with whatever spices or condiments I had. The produce tends to be inexpensive and it isnt difficult to get even basic spices to make a nice salsa or pico de gallo. After nothing but peanut butter, the fresh produce tasted godly. 

8. Staying cool/staying warm. I live in Florida so we generally only have hot and very humid weather with a couple weeks to a month of below 50 weather. After four years, Im simply just used to Floridas heat and humidity, so keeping my windows cracked, staying hydrated and may be on a very hot night, having my little battery fan going to circulate air is all I need.

For cold however, you want to focus on heat retention. Layer up, and if you can try to acquire and pile on as many blankets and even towels and clothes as you can, and more importantly dont forget to layer under yourself as well. Wear a beanie or a hoodie with the hood up to keep heat on your head. 

If your A/C works (mine hasnt in years; i dont miss it tbh), try to limit it to quick blasts to heat up your vehicle. You dont want to wear out your A/C by using it all the time. 

And again, if you dont have a car, it may be time to lean on a shelter or look into camping options. You'll need a good spot if you want to build a fire, preferably on land youre allowed to camp on anyway. 

9. Stay connected. This ties into having a phone, but in general you dont want to lose sight of your ""place"" in society. Keep your vehicles tags updated as best yiu can, try to maintain insurance, and if you have a bank stay in good with them. My credit union has helped me out of jams a couple of times in my life and I always do my best to not let my auto loan be late with them. In doing so it can open you up to other avenues for help down the line. 

But this tip also applies to having an address. A PO Box is relatively inexpensive, and using a shelter as an address can work in a pinch, though I would lie to employers about it, and rely on email for any W2s or other communications you need from your employer. 

And naturally, dont neglect the people that know you. Not everybody has friends or family who might step in to help out (I dont lmao), but pushing them away isnt a good call.

10. Dont fall into the trap of selling stuff to stay afloat. It works in a pinch, but what really happens is that eventually you just run out of stuff. Pawn your valuables if you need quick cash, but dont just give them up if you can help it. 

Letting go of less necessary items can be a liberating experience for some, but essentially throwing too much away can leave you with nothing to really show for it. Money can easily disappear; stuff, not so much. 

Fun anecdote: falling into this trap is part of what put me in the situation that lead to me being homeless. 

And finally, for my last tip:

Always keep your eye on the future, dont give up, and always be planning for the day the nightmare ends. 

While I, as mentioned earlier, am taking a longer road to not being homeless than most would expect to be reasonable, it comes on the heels of rushing the process twice and having it bite me in the ass twice. What I learned was that, for my situation, the only thing holding me back is having a stable job that pays enough not just to occupy an apartment or rented room, but to actually live as well. 

In my situation, Im currently closer to r/vandweller than I am to r/homeless, so for me its a relatively easy choice after two heartbreaks to focus on setting myself up for success. Im finishing my 2 year degree this year, getting the hell out of this shitty area Im in, and hopefully Ill either be able to find a good job in my new area, or at least Ill be able to continue school until I can pursue my career, which is when I feel Ill be stable enough to bite the bullet again. 

But for you, that might not be the plan. With what might be on the horizon for all of us, it might not even be my plan. 

In my life, however, I have inexplicably developed a keen sense of perseverance. No matter how bad my life gets, or how bad I feel, I am somehow compelled to just keep going. To keep my eye on the prize, as they say. 

Finding such a sense in yourself is going to be the most valuable tip anyone can give, pending threat of homelessness not withstanding. 

---

And thats it. As said, take this all with a grain of salt, and for those that care to comment on my priorities, kindly stow it. My priorities are what they are because of how my life has been, and thats how it is for everyone. Theres little sense in judging anyone's priorities. It accomplishes nothing and you look like an asshole. 

And as tip 4 says, dont be an asshole.",2020-06-03 20:08:49,2020,6,3,20,8,49
gvzyit,9,tipsysaw,5,homeless,Getting kicked out.,"Hi.  
My name is Rasmus. My entire life has revolved around what my parent think and their negative thoughts has always went towards me. I have 3 Brothers and they have been a challenge for them.  
Today my parents had a breakdown and said that I have until Monday to get out of the house or they will throw me out. I am at the breaking point of my dream that is becoming a pro gamer, I am in a tournament called Dr. Pepper challenge. In this tournament they decide 25 players that go to the next step and gaining 12 weeks of coaching by a polish coach. I reached that phase. I am one of the 25 contenders that they chose. We are 5 teams that will go up against eachother and the winner gets a sponsorship.  


I told my parents about this since they thought that the years i have spent figuring out what i want to study and do with my life have been useless and a waste of time. Their word were like a knife stabbing my heart, so close to my dream and so close to finishing it and they dont care.   
I have even signed up for studies after the summer and they said that they are throwing me out because I am ruining their life together. I have done everything in my power to make them realise that living at home by the age of 22 today is not that strange. I help with laundry, the dishes, walking the dog, paying for the food, helping my two younger brothers with their homework and I have even payed rent when they have asked me to.  
Their words to me after I explained all this were. ""We dont care, you dont do enough and your younger brother sees you as his idol, it is not okey that you sit by the computer playing because he will waste his entire life like you.""  


People that is reading this might not see it as such a big issue, I know this is in a thread about people with real problems and they should have a right to throw me out by the age of 22. I just dont know what to do with my life, I am so close to my dream and now they just make it go away. Maybe someone in this thread can help me in some way to get a plan, or a different mindset. I will jump between cities to stay with some different friends couple a days, but I have lost all my will power and I feel dead inside.  
I am forced to skip my studies for the semester i signed up for and I will have to get a job so i can get a place to stay for my own.   
But the issue for me is that I am losing my dream, my opportunity and all of the people I love in it.  
I love my parents and my entire life has revolved around not being a burden, about being a good enough son and making my dreams into reality.   


The truth is that they have never supported anything in my life, not my friends since they were gamers, but worst of all school. I did fine in school until I came home with a B in my worst subject and they complained that it was not a A.   
That ruined school for me, I stopped caring and I am fucked so to say. I hope everyone is safe with     Covid-19. Peace out.

As if having everything shut down because of the virus wasn't bad enough.....no libraries, no place to shower, no place to get inside, no electricity, no wifi, non-stop rain day and night for weeks.......I thought at least there wouldn't be any more bullshit piled on. Wrong. People decided it would be cool to start destroying things and as a result of that, now there is a curfew. When you haven't showered for 78 days, one thing that is really important is to try and stay out of the sun when it is 90 degrees all day. So I usually try to move around and get my food and other stuff after dark when it is cooler. Not anymore. Can't be outside from 8pm to 5am. Not only that, it isn't safe to be where I had been - thanks to the crowds, the protesters, the rioters..........and the police and national guard. So in addition to all the crap I was already dealing with - now I can't sleep or eat.  Thanks a lot. I'm going to stop asking if things can get any worse.",2020-06-02 08:33:25,2020,6,2,8,33,25
gum4o3,171,mtempissmith,13,homeless,Warning: If You Are Homeless Don't Do This!,"Don't sit up to sleep for days on end. Find a bench or someplace else you can get horizontal in. Drop in centers, trains, anywhere you have to sit up a lot can be VERY dangerous. Your body needs to lay flat at night to sleep so that your blood will circulate properly and not stress your heart. Sitting up for long periods of time with no lying down at night can cause blood clots, lots of them in your legs and chest. This is why respite beds are so important. In the street, in the train it's common for cops to hassle you to sit up but you must lay down or risk pulmonary issues. Speaking from personal experience here. I nearly DIED last year because I did this for too long not being able to sleep outside because of Winter weather. I'm better now but this is not something you want to risk. Trust me on this one. It can have lasting effects on your health. I have to take blood thinners. I use a walker now because my legs have issues still. No joke.",2020-06-01 09:00:13,2020,6,1,9,0,13

Me and my girlfriend are currently homeless. Been so for a few weeks. Earlier today I got to talk to another guy who was homeless who gave me a few tips about getting food. The best thing was that I could just fish in a lot of places around here for free. We went to a nice spot and I was just sitting there and literally watching fish jumping out of the water. Anyway I'm looking for advice on if there's any kind of organization that might be able to help us get maybe a fishing pole or maybe some survival gear like a tent or a few hammocks. I have looked around myself and it seems like there's nothing available for that. I would just go buy what we need but since I lost my job we're down to nothing now.

I brace myself for a fight to the death but then he asks, ""C'mon man, are you really willing to die tonight over a backpack?""

I respond with ""Yes.""

He paused for a few seconds, and then walked away, telling me to have a good night. It is a bit odd that he didn't use the spray on me, he had a clear shot. Which makes me think there was nothing in the can.

I've been talking to a woman I met on facebook dating and we were working on setting up our first date when she went dark for a few days. When she finally called me back, she sounded desperate, claiming that the person she had been staying with had almost raped her, so she had filed a police report and moved out. She has a job, but it just started a few days ago, so it could be weeks before her first paycheck.

Since then, we've talked a few times, and things only seem to have gotten worse. She says that all of the shelters she checked with are full and she has been sleeping outside and washing up at work, hoping nobody will notice.

I've given up on dating her, since she apparently has issues and is too busy dealing with them to even consider a relationship, but I'm becoming concerned for her well-being. I'm not a fool, so I'm not about allow an almost total stranger to stay at my apartment or spend money trying to set her up at a hotel.

Is going into this career, a shitty one, a high stress one, really better than just being homeless?

And then a 5 year residency working 80-100 hours per week in a stressful job.—I want NONE of it. I grunt at the thought of it, at the thought of studying and learning more tiny details.

I’d rather just quit it all, never work a day in my life and just sit on the streets in warm Miami, Venice or Hawaii beaches while getting food stamps. That’s all I need. I just want to lay down and do nothing.

The thing is though, it’s already been 3 weeks past the 5-7 days and I have received mail from them that has a later date than my return should have on it. Meaning the have sorted through the mail already.

I'm set to inherit a house, but I have no ability to care for it properly. I do not have any real skills to do even simple things like shingle a roof or replace a window, and I won't have the savings to have it done. And I doubt that I can ever afford property taxes.

I want to become voluntarily ""homeless"", but I would like a permanent structure to do it in. Slab City looks like the choice for new- and I would like very much to make it my permanent home.

There are concrete shells you can have constructed. A simple binishell should cost under $6,500 to construct. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binishell

I will probably never be able to afford an RV, the but a concrete shell with a composting toilet should be doable. 

There sem to be four main challenges with my plan:

(A) Finding a construction company in the vicinity willing to take the project on

(B) Finding any kind of steady income in the vicinity - most people barter

(C) Learning to survive in temperatures which can reach up to 117 degrees in the summer.

(4) Learning to fit in

I'm very clean, no record, ""conscience""(in my Jordan Peterson voice), and cause zero problems. I'm very in tune with my body and  been experiencing some  respiratory problems , and I know I'm probably a carrier. So I've been coming back to this one spot to quarantine since they have yellow tape up and no people have attempted to come here up where I'm at for the most part. 



I think A Karen or Craig may have noticed and called security on me because you can't physically see me from the street, and he made a b-line to my exact location. Told me that the park is closed and there are ""better places I could sleep"". Yeah, no. There really isn't. This is the best spot because it shields me from rain, I can hear every step of someone coming up here who may want to add me to the missing persons database, you can't visibly see me unless you went out of you way, and there are not rats and bugs to deal with. 


I tell him that I am self quarantining and he asks me if I got tested, that it is ""absolutely free at this point"". It makes no difference whether I actually have it or not because there is no cure and you'd just tell me to go somewhere else, regardless. Although the park is supposedly closed, people come to the dog park here, loiter on the grass, and do workouts. But I didn't see him even  attempt to tell them to go back to their warm , million dollar condos they have waiting for them that they're 'bored' of. If I'm spreading disease, so are they. There are rocks and benches to sit on, trash and gate handles to touch(I've seen them and  their kids touch all of these things), etc.. So they really have no argument other than 'iTs tHe rUlEs!. It would be more prudent fir me to stay in this one spotthan wander all day spreading disease. I didn't say any of this to him because I don't want him purposely fucking with me, and ill be damned if I don't go back to my favorite spot. Fuck it. What are they going to do, sue me for my fuckin' 50$ snap check? Throw me in a cell with central air, three square meals a day, with entertainment? Please!


It's exhausting and it drains my willpower to the point where Im starting not to give a damn. You want to clog up the street on your 8th walk of your day at 8am? Fuck you, get this bug. And while some of you may die, that's a sacrifice that you are willing to make. Muhahahhahahah.

Please correct me if this is uncalled for, but I go to the same grocery store every couple of days for things and for the past week or so I’ve seen the same young woman sitting nearby and I believe she doesn’t have a place to go. She sits on a bench and has been wearing the same pair of socks, and she carries a large shopping bag with some clothing in it. The other day she was just sat there sobbing and my heart broke. I did not know what to say except for “Please be healthy and safe,” and she was very kind. Today I saw her again and it is cold and stormy out. Same socks. Bundles in a jacket. Not crying today. Just sitting, and I said hello to her and she smiled. I told her I was thinking of her and that I hope she is okay and safe today. I didn’t have any cash on me to give  She looks to be in her early 20’s like me and she isn’t asking for anything, but it doesn’t seem she’s moved in days, and I’ve said prayers for her multiple times because something about her has stood out to me. For all I know she could be fine and well, but I have a feeling she may not be. Would it be strange of me to give her a small care package? I don’t have much to give, and I’m not one of those to assume “She’s on drugs,” or whatever and have the audacity to choose her a meal or give her a limited gift card. It’s not my place to decide what anyone does with what I give them and I just want to help or show some compassion because it hurts to see someone who may be suffering. I was thinking of making a little package with $20 cash or so, again I’m in college and don’t have much money. An extra tube of toothpaste and toothbrush, a package of feminine products, some baby wipes, granola bars/some small bags of chips I have and some masks since I have masks for Coronavirus. Do you think this would come across as rude or presumptuous? I just don’t know how to help but I feel as if I must. I can not stop thinking about this young girl and her safety. Thank you for any advice or ways to make a care package for her.

Hey everyone. I took all of your advice and made her this package. Delivered it around noon - https://imgur.com/a/b7oKaf0

I put all the things in the backpack. Feminine products, toiletries, cash, hand warmers, meal bars and various snacks, a new towel. Honestly anything i thought may help. She was very apprehensive at first but accepted it very quietly. She told me she “has a place to go, sort of. It’s complicated” and i told her no worries. she does not to explain anything to me unless she wants to. I left feeling a bit weird but hopeful. 
After work my mom drove near there because its on the way home and said “Was the girl you gave your bag to black?” I said, “Yes. Why” She said, “I saw a young woman with your backpack. She had a drink and a little bag of food” and apparently was eating. It was definitely her because i had not told my mom any identifying characteristics of her, just let her know where i was going for safety.

No, but it's doable. If you are homeless or are going to be homeless, plan out the basics to live: hygiene, food, clothes, shelter. Depending on your area, there should be social nonprofits that have services to help you with those things. And some can help you get ready to get a job (if you're able to) and get out of homelessness. All the best to you.",2020-04-24 10:51:14,2020,4,24,10,51,14

g1t26n,1,Polimber,3,homeless,How to shelter in place in Los Angeles when you're homeless.,"A month ago when everyone was rushing to the stores and buying everything in sight, TP, food water, etc. I wondered how it was going to affect shelters that might depend on people's donations.

Then the governor, et. al. declared a shelter/safer at home policy to deter the spread within the community. I also thought with all the closures if libraries, coffee shops and, well almost everything else how does one survive while living on the street.

I've done 15 interviews from service providers to the homeless joint authority , journalists to researchers and they've all been great. 

But I'm missing the voices of people that are ACTUALLY going through this without a tenant residence.

Is there anyone, living homeless in los Angeles that would be willing to be filmed, filmed themselves, etc to talk about their own struggles? 

Peele haven't demanded enough action from their politicians to do something about the conditions that it fellow humans endure. Not that this is the one true answer, but I hope to be a part of the solution.

Please either on me or leave a comment below if you're interested.",2020-04-15 08:33:53,2020,4,15,8,33,53

g0zfll,263,The7thRustySpoon,83,homeless,I can’t say fuck the police anymore,"It’s currently 12:54 at night. At around 9:30 I was woken up by 1 of 2 cops who have told me that I couldn’t sleep at a bench in a public park. Both of whom would just walk up to me with my small blanket wrapped around my upper body and my head down. I was told the usual, “we can’t have you sleeping here, you are trespassing, we don’t want to arrest you but we will if we have to” I took this as cops being cops, and them doing their jobs. They would walk away without a word and go on about their night. The 2nd cop (who I wasn’t expecting was different) before I continue, I would like to add that it’s been 3 days since I’ve eaten any real food except for a chicken nugget and around 6 cold fries I found in a abandoned happy meal, found out I couldn’t qualify for the stimulus package, and 1 of 2 of my charger cables broke. This man took 30 mins of his time (small amount I know but it means a lot to me) calling around 10 different shelters or locations trying to help me find somewhere to sleep and or better my situation. He came back to me and told me how none of the places he called were accepting due to COVID-19 (I wasn’t aware he was dialing numbers as I was fell back to asleep as soon as he got into his car) I was a bit shocked when he told me this, but he recommended a shelter for men for me near downtown that could possibly aid in my situation. Even letting me know that he wouldn’t mind giving me a ride tomorrow or the day after downtown to the shelter instead of walking there. He gave me their number and address and before he left, I asked him if he could spare some money. I wasn’t thinking he would give me any because the other 2 cops firmly denied me money. But this man without hesitation pulled his wallet out and gave me $6 without me saying much else! He told me to take care of myself and told me that he thought I was a really intelligent, and polite child and that the shelter wouldn’t have a reason not to help me out. As he left, I cried in my blanket trying to hold back the tears. I (much like what it seems like 70% of the world) suffer from depression and even worse PTSD. I’m only 20 and I’ve been going through a lot of emotions although I’ve only been on the streets officially homeless for a week and living in my car for 2 months. I have dreams and aspirations and they quickly faded away once my predicament got worse, I thought I would never have a family that I could call my own in the future, this man has sparked that ambitious and hopeful flame again. And for that, I won’t necessarily say that all cops are good. But after tonight, I’d be a hypocrite for saying fuck the police. Thank you for reading :)



EDIT: Hello everyone! I just wanted to say thank you so much for one, reading my post as I didn’t think I would get any sort of response back. And second, I want to say thank to everyone who have replied with kind words and prayers for my prosperity. When I was living in my car, I felt alone. I didn’t feel like I could possibly fight what I was fighting like others have for way longer than I have. But everyone who has replied to me or have helped me have a special place in my heart. I no longer feel alone. I feel like people want to see me win and succeed, and that’s exactly what I plan to do. If anyone wants, I can keep a update on my condition and situation if you all would like. I would like to keep contact with the people who are rooting for me during this really tough time. Thank you guys so much ❤️



UPDATE!: I have received another blessing everyone. Just today I got the opportunity to eat for the first time in multiple days thanks to the cop and Due to everyone being so eager to help me in this sort of situation. I’ve met many different cool people online in this platform. One of them being a new friend I made today, Andre. He was a pretty cool laidback guy who lives life wherever it may take him. He was in a unfortunate situation, and decided to live in his car willingly. He drove to my city from his which was around a 35 mins. And he gave me the option to select a wide assortment of camping gear, canned food and other useful items. A hour before Andre and I exchange numbers. A old coworker asks me to contact another old coworker. I contacted this woman, and it was at this moment, after spilling my story, admitting some of my downfalls, and explaining my situation, she offered me her trailer in her backyard. I was overjoyed, finally I was picked up by my coworkers and explained my my situation and showed how hurt they felt for me being in such a position. I made it to my old job (and when I mean old job, I mean the first restaurant I worked at, and not the one that fired me.) talked to my coworker about staying in the trailer, the rules, the expectations. She believes that I can change this whole matter around and better the situation as much as I do myself. I have now eaten my second meal since not being able to for 3 days and the food taste gets better and better. I’m working with my coworker on getting me hired at Jersey Mike’s, as well as trying to find a way to get me some ID. First we need to get me some proof of residence, but that won’t be hard. I took avery thorough shower. I wasn’t really embarrassed by how dirty I really was, wearing multiple layers in this Spring.....summer.....thing hahaha. It felt so nice to feel so clean. We all watched a little TV together and smoked a little weed together. I’m currently writing this in my current living space and it’s so damn nice. I’ll have to upload some pictures for you guys of them and the new space but holy cow. I must be luckiest person ever. I wish and hope my luck can shine on others that are in way worse positions. I’m very grateful for this opportunity, and I assure everyone that this chance that I’m being given won’t be for nothing. I promise. Thank you guys for listening to me throughout this crazy past 2 days. It’s only really scary how things picked up hahaha.",2020-04-13 23:12:54,2020,4,13,23,12,54

fzxsx9,90,DJ44x,34,homeless,So tired.,"Tomorrow will be 1 month since my last shower. I have sent about 50 emails to every possible person and organization here in Raleigh - each time asking about some program that there was a news article about that sounded like it would help. The answer is always no. Just yesterday there was this big headline in the local paper making it sound like all homeless people were being put up in hotels everywhere. Turns out - like most such news stories - that isn't true. Everything that at-first, sounds like it is great news.....always ends up being nothing. All that extra, extended, super-sized unemployment benefit stuff for the self-employed? Not eligible / not set up yet / need records / have to verify / don't meet the requirements, etc....The hotel rooms? Have to have kids, be released from a hospital, get tested positive and have proof, etc....And even when there is something that sounds like it \*might\* help, nobody ever answers, responds, or says they will forward it - and I never hear from them again. And now on top of everything else, this huge area of severe storms and tornadoes and hail is coming and is gonna last for like 24 hours. I also love how everyone has all these masks - except me. Can't find them, can't buy them, can't make them, can't wash them. And what maybe is the most upsetting, while I am struggling to find a bathroom that is actually open somewhere - and doing the best I can to stay away from all these people who aren't happy about being trapped at home - they fucking will not stay away from me. If I see people anywhere within a quarter mile of me, I stop, and then do whatever I can to keep a huge distance between them and me. But it doesn't seem to work the other way around. Everyone feels the need to keep coming within inches of me. I am terrified of catching this thing. No insurance, no doctor, no health care of any kind and NC of course hasn't expanded Medicaid. I wonder how many homeless people have died and are going to die from this thing who won't be counted. If you actually live in a place that has got its act together and got you into a hotel, let me know because from what I can tell it is just pure fiction around here.",2020-04-12 08:38:14,2020,4,12,8,38,14

As a former homeless individual, I would like the Homeless population in Victoria to be housed at UVIC in the residence and/or field if they want to maintain proper social distancing and do not want to be indoors. This is a matter of compassion and doing what is moral.

There is ample space, and the facility is currently not being used. This way, like minded advocates can be there for them; and assist them with amenities they need near by. This is the best option available. I would like to see UVIC step up and do its part to help these people which are just like you and I during this crisis.

Thank you UVIC!

fwn68c,160,DJ44x,32,homeless,I don't think most people realize how screwed we are,"So my last shower was on Monday, March 16th.  During all of this ""Stay at home"" order stuff that has been going on, I have obviously been stuck outside, in public, near other people who I either can't get away from or who won't stay far enough away from me. I have no running water to wash my hands, nothing to ""construct"" a face mask from, and when I try to search for any disinfecting items or masks anywhere - there are none anyway. All these things they are repeatedly telling everyone to do - I can't do just like all homeless people can't do. And even though I have spent hours every day searching for help from the city, the county, the state, - everywhere - there is none for homeless people. At first they were just saying to go to a shelter. Yeah, I've seen how that's been working out with everyone getting sick. But what I don't think most of these normal people (who are sitting at home watching TV on their comfortable couches, snacking on foods that they get delivered from their favorite restaurants) understand is just how bad the options are.  And it is a lot worse for us. First, nobody on the planet who hasn't already been infected is immune, and nobody will be until they develop a vaccine. That isn't going to happen for at least 18 months, most likely. So your choices as they stand right now are - get the virus, get really sick, hope you survive and aren't in the 20% who have to get hospitalized, or stay locked away from everyone and everything - and hope that you clean everything that comes near you well enough to keep from being infected. I don't care how long you try, it is only a matter of time before you miss something.  People aren't going to stay inside for a year. So almost everyone is going to get sick sooner or later. The shitty thing is that homeless people are like on the front lines with no protection and nobody cares. I expect to get sick every day. I can't go inside, I can't stay home, they've closed and locked all of the places that would have helped. Of all the fucking times to close all the bathrooms and prevent any access to hot water and soap.  It is bad and it is going to stay bad for a long time.",2020-04-07 10:09:22,2020,4,7,10,9,22

fttn12,0,Statecomidwest,1,homeless,Human Traffickers Operate Most Homeless Shelters,"Homelessness and Human Trafficking are often tackled separately. But the cycle is perpetual, human traffickers wear down victims to become slaves, and most homeless organizations aren't prepared to take on multilevel fraud, that is if they aren't founded to purposely profit from taking advantage of vulnerable populations. Layers of fraud also appear in domestic violence shelters, but the equation differs in that DV shelters pronounce a facet of financial abuse from a person. Homeless shelters rather leave the ""f"" silent and pretend the homeless aren't victims of the financial abuse of many criminals - most shelters gaslight victims of crimes who end up homeless and tell them that their victimization was resultant of  needing to learn something. All homeless people need to learn is that they became that way because of criminals who capitalized off flash mobs screwing them.

I can't help but wonder will these massive unemployment rates cause an increase in people in similar situations and therefore states or cities will create more programs or create more housing opportunities for those with evictions on their record.",2020-04-02 11:31:26,2020,4,2,11,31,26

ftc4y1,5,Big_OG_Homeless,3,homeless,Big homie's guide to homelessness,"So you've found yourself homeless through whatever circumstances they may be: What's your next move? What are your options?

Homeless OG is here to provide you with an easy-to-use guide to help you through this trying time.

&#x200B;

1. Location, location, location! Perhaps you've found yourself stranded in a tent in the woods or living out of your car. I will start by saying these two options are vastly preferable to shelters of any kind. In homeless shelters you may be forced to, get this: maturely and responsibly deal with other grown adults in a closed setting. We all know homie don't play that and any mother fucker who gets out of pocket is gonna have to get these hands, which leads me to suggest avoiding these places at all costs. This leads to our next bullet point..

&#x200B;

2. The LAW! While I personally recommend doing everything in your power to avoid legal troubles while homeless, we all know that sometimes you may be forced (or think you're being forced) to stay in one spot due to various legal proceedings that you may be involved in.. fuck that! Keep your head down and away from various agents of the law as long as you can and if you get caught up in any bullshit that requires you to stick around town, try to at least to keep a low profile. However, once you're in the clear legally, high-tail it outta town as fast as you can. Speaking of splitting town, this segues into our next point:

&#x200B;

3. Getting out! Now that you know Johnny-law isn't on your ass to stay put, we can start working on leaving the immediate area. Do you have any close friends that can take you in? Has your close family given up on you or just plain tired of your bullshit? Here's a simple way around those hurdles: Your significant other! Your boyfriend/girlfriend must surely have some relatives somewhere in another state that you can crash with/mooch off of for a while. Try to really drive home to your boo the necessity of getting the hell out of dodge and in the process, homelessness itself. Remember that once you're in the clear and safe behind walls and civilization, you can write a handy how-to-guide like this one, showing off to everyone online what a tough time you had in your couple of months of homelessness and espouse your expert wisdom on the subject. They don't know how hard it is out here! 

A tip i've included in this point is to not let your boo catch you commenting on any NSFW subreddits, especially those based on ebonyBBWs or the like or she'll have that ass in the dog house right quick, G!

&#x200B;

I wanna close out this guide by finally saying that once you get back to being housed, try as soon as possible to get a game console so you can get right back to playing that vintage copy of Grand Theft Auto 4. You know a playa's mad skills atrophy on the streets and nothing gets those reflexes back up to par like cruising around with Niko Belic on the streets of liberty city but the streets of Liberty city will feel easy compared to the streets you survived on for a few weeks!

I'm currently stuck living in my car. I was lucky enough to have someone very kind help me get home with the gas money I would need. Unfortunately the funds were sent to me using an e-check. And I looks like we'll still be out here close to another week waiting for it to clear. I'm looking for someone who might be able to help me out by sending me the funds now and I could return it once the check clears. I know it's going to be near impossible to find anyone willing to trust a homeless guy but I can provide you with any info you may need to treat it like a loan. Obviously my credit isn't good enough for me to get a loan the traditional way or I'd already have this taken care of. The amount I'm waiting on is $80 and for anyone who might want to help that would be the amount I would need and be able to pay back once it clears. I could add a few dollars but not much.

Same as the title, I want to find a homeless person near my house (Vancouver) and want to try to give them another chance at life. I have a $3,000 dollar budget roughly. I would appreciate it if you guys can help. (I'm going to be waiting until the COVID-19 outbreak slows down a little bit before doing anything, but wanted to prepare/research while I'm free).

I was thinking, with this amount of money, I can get a cheap car (\~$1,000), a cellphone with a 1 year plan (\~$500), clean clothing + other necessities (\~$300), and the rest for drug rehab (\~$1,200). I've heard doing these things would help a homeless person get a job and then eventually an apartment, etc.

What do you guys think? Is there something else I should look into before finding someone? Is my budget too small for such an expedition and should I instead focus on contributing a little for a large number of people rather than all for 1 person?

Any feedback is appreciated.",2020-03-24 02:33:15,2020,3,24,2,33,15
fnub6o,0,Lonelymaiden12345,1,homeless,People in my community purposely made me homeless,"Employers, educators and mental health professionals in my city purposely discriminated against me and made me homeless so that I would be forced to go through the mental health system and criminal justice system in my town (got me framed for a crime) and also the public housing system. 

Homelessness is a business in my town. This is a regular thing here, there's an entire area of people that are  living in section 8, forced to take disability and social security.

Case management and mental health are booming businesses in this town.

I guess I want to relocate but I am afraid any attempt to relocate will be a failure.

If I try to move to another state they will refuse me in a homeless shelter because I didn't have residence in that state prior to moving there. Thus I will be stuck in permanent homelessness.


So my questions are:

Is homelessness/ case management abuse a problem everywhere or just here?

The community centers are closed, too, because of the coronavirus outbreak. Even the emergency warming shelters won't be opening tonight.

They've [halted intake](https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-coronavirus-homelessness-covid-19-prevention-shelters/) in order to leave more beds empty and create social distancing between guests:

>As of last week, Transition Projects \[by far the largest operator of shelters in our county\] has temporarily stopped taking in new guests across their shelters. ... Transition Projects is not the only provider bringing intake to a sudden halt.

They're not even opening emergency warming shelters this weekend, despite temperatures falling below freezing.

All of the [libraries have closed indefinitely](https://multcolib.org/blog/20200313/multnomah-county-libraries-close-due-covid-19). These are places homeless people rely on to stay safe, warm and dry during the day, as well as to use the internet and charge a phone.

The [community centers are closed](https://www.wweek.com/news/2020/03/13/portland-parks-recreation-closes-all-recreation-centers-and-pools/), too, removing the other major option for staying out of the snow.

fg4bdq,3,Markdd8,7,homeless,"Is *self-quarantining* by some homeless (using the term quarantine loosely here) a reasonable expectation by critics of homeless people with serious drug, alcohol behavioral issues?","The headline might piss off some people, but hear this out.  

Go back in history, 1960s, pre-homeless era.  In most large American cities, hundreds of hardcore alcoholics lived in skid rows (The U.S. doesn't have many skid rows anymore, and [in some respects that's a problem](https://mises.org/wire/homelessness-and-failure-urban-renewal).    The alcoholics were housed in cheap Single Room Occupancies, but typically didn't work and spent their days hanging out, drinking.  

In a sense they were America's *original street people.* 

Some were content to hang out in the skid rows, where police tolerated public drinking and disorderly behavior.  (For all the alleged extremism of law and order types, we were never big advocates of incarcerating alcoholics, unless they engaged in serious crime.) 

But some alcoholics ventured  to business and tourist districts, to drink and panhandle.  They caused various problems, and got *rousted* by the cops, who would take them back to skid row (or the ""drunk tank"" for a few hours). There are  accounts of drunks being rousted many hundreds of times.

Civil libertarians opposed this *rousting,* which was often done under anti-loitering statutes, though having an open container or being drunk and disorderly is often also basis to take someone into custody.  *Long story short, civil libertarians won at the  Supreme Court;* America's anti-loitering statutes on public property have largely been overturned.  [(Also note  the SCOTUS ruling in 2019 offering more rights to the homeless](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-won-t-disturb-ruling-against-anti-homeless-law-n1102616)).

This helps explain why, today, in many American cities, we see alcoholics and addicts hanging out in busy business districts, causing disruption.  And because reformers have gotten some cities and states  *not to arrest* people for being disorderly or possessing hard drugs (e.g., in California, [Prop 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_California_Proposition_47)), this basis for moving these people on has disappeared also.

*Does this help create the picture?*  In my city our homeless people mostly camp about 1-2 miles from the city center, many in a large forest area.  About 1/3 of them, several hundred, come downtown  every day and hang out getting high and cause problems.  

Is it unreasonable to ask that homeless with serious drug and alcohol problems engage in some *voluntary self quarantine?*    In other words, if you want to get high all day -- Don't do it in a busy tourist or business district. 

Obviously a lot of these folks aren't in a condition to be cognizant of this appeal; this post is heavily directed at *homeless advocates,* often reform-minded social workers and outreach workers (housed) who have a big say in policies and outcomes regarding the homeless.  

Thus far *homeless advocates seem generally hostile* to any proposal that problem homeless be semi-segregated, or contained in any fashion.  Of course housing is a solution, but in the absence of housing for all homeless--*the reality in many places*--let's work with the situation at hand.

Remember there's always this option: [Homelessness and Prison](https://thecrimereport.org/2019/02/22/homeless-formerly-incarcerated-more-likely-to-be-incarcerated-study/).

But, for the love of me, I can't figure out how on earth i'm supposed to be able to wake up so early in the morning and slave away doing physical labor when i'm not even getting 3 hours sleep, whether i'm in a noisy smelly shelter, or sleeping outside in the rain.

How am I supposed to align my meal times, shower times, toilet times, find a place to store my stuff during work, make sure I sleep enough, find enough time to shave every now and then, and not smell like a giant sweaty ballsack all while working 10-12 hours breaking my back on low nutrients and less than half of the required fucking sleep?

I got to say guys, i'm reaching the end of my rope here. I'm able and ready to work, no addiction, controllable mental health, but I don't see a way out anymore. There are no 9-5's for me because I have a criminal record and minimum wage dead end jobs are not enough to get me a place, and construction genuinely opened the doors to trades for me, which is great.

But i'm just trying to wrap my head around how the hell i'm supposed to manage this for a couple of months.

Hello. My name is Amber and things have been rough lately. I try to pretend that everything is great and wonderful when I’m actually at home in my bed battling major depression and severe anxiety.

I'm currently trying to figure out if life's circumstances are causing these afflictions, or if these afflictions are causing life's circumstances. I am writing this because I am in a very bad situation right now, one that I can't handle on my own, although I know I need to get up and get things taken care of and deal with life's circumstances and take care of myself, here I lie in bed unable to focus enough to make it to the kitchen and figure out what to eat. 
I have been told that due to the fact that I am now two months behind on rent I have until the end of March to pay rent or to be out of my apartment. I’m not sure what I will do when that time comes. I have put everything I own up for sale. I’m desperate.

This is my last resort, I really need help and anything will be appreciated. I’m worried and I don’t want to be on the street and evicted. Please help me.",2020-03-04 10:47:27,2020,3,4,10,47,27
fcz9q0,95,Squiber228,14,homeless,"Found a home, a car, and a job","I just wanted to share that it does get better. A little over a month ago I left my home and friends during a full blown psychosis. Found myself a thousand miles away with nothing but my dufflebag and a hundred dollars. I worked a couple jobs and found a work exchange then lived inside for a couple weeks. 

Well, the job didn't work out and neither did the work exchange so I went back to the thing I'm good at: traveling. It was harder than I remembered. A lot harder. I was undergeared. My body can't take the stress like it used to. My mind couldn't either. 

So I hitched north and found myself in a national Forest. Then found myself in the next town north after a kind stranger gave me a lift. The night before I was dehydrated and hallucinating in the woods, in bear country.

Just as I'm about to bed down for the night I hear someone trying to sell a car for cheap. Insanely cheap. So I buy it. The catch is, all I had was a bill of sale and a suspended license. Still a thousand miles from where I left the previous month. 

I make it about two hours before getting pulled over. The whole time he's running my ID I'm praying, bargaining, what have you. I'm sure my car is going to be impounded and I'm going to jail. 

The cop walks back to my window, ""good news, you have a valid license.""

So he gives me three warnings and sends me on my way. He gave me safe passage. I'm back where most of my friends and family are. 

This morning I walk into a diner for a coffee. They had a hiring sign. The interview was then and there. I look like holy hell and probably smell like shit as well.  But, against all odds, they hire me. I have insurance now so i can get on the meds I desperately need.  

What happened isn't ordinary. I got lucky and I think God may actually exist.

It still doesn't feel real and part of me expects to wake up in that forest again.

I had a feeling to ask her how she was doing, so I did. She explained how her family refused to take her to the hospital to get her wrist operated on, how ride to care also said they could bring her there but not pick her up, this is in isolated Alberta Canada. Her wrist was swollen, huge compared to her frail frame. We talked about the mistreatment from her family, and my mother came out and I gave her the 5$. Honestly I didn't care if it was going to be spent on drugs or alcohol, I just wanted her to be comfortable . Withdrawal is something I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. As she walked away, I told her ""take care of yourself"" and she looked at me like no one had ever told her that in her entire life, she was surprised and turned around and came back to talk some more. I told her about some resources in the area that are worth a try for the elderly, and as we ended our conversation I told her god bless, she said ""I love you"" and I said it back. It made me realize just how much these neglected people crave love, they are people just like us. And they need love and care. Even if you can't help financially , an ear to listen is what they need.

Spend my days at the library, reading, writing, drinking (with ninja stealth of course, how else). They close at nine, I grab my shit, steal food at the store, then bike a mile back to the nature reserve, hoping my tent is still there.

Only been doing this for like two weeks, it came out of the blue so I had almost no time to prepare, get my gear in order, nothing. This weekend I'm building a better camp further into the woods, this shitty tent will only serve me so long, and it's already breaking. 

Biggest problem so far has not been warmth, food or water, but hygiene. Can't wash my clothes when it's freezing out, nowhere to dry them. Can't dry them by the fire because they'll just reek of smoke. Showers, god damn, I miss showers. And coffee. I'm this close to start bathing in the lake. It's below freezing temperatures here right now, I'm not looking forward to that shit. Last time I did that was literally in the army. Thank god for survival training, I'd be dead without it.

Lack a pot to boil water in, will get one this weekend. Then I'll be able to wash myself properly.

I finally found a room for rent that fit my budget, allowed my two large dogs, and didn’t have any single guys living there. The dogs were definitely the hardest requirement to fulfill. Last Saturday we moved in and Yesterday marked the end of my first week with a stable living situation since November. From November 5th to February 15th I lived in motel rooms, my car, the homeless shelter, and (for the last two weeks) a friends guest room (which doesn’t count IMO). 

When I was at the shelter or my friends house I couldn’t have my dogs with me, so they stayed in long term dog boarding for 56 days. I made payments on their stay every two weeks. Last Saturday we were finally reunited.

I still have a lot of debt, but I think I’m finally in a place where I’m not drowning in it anymore... perhaps I’m doggy paddling.

I was very blessed to have a good job, a car, a safe and clean shelter to go to, supportive family, concerned friends (who didn’t know the whole situation, but were still very helpful), and an excellent dog boarding discount. I understand that those things made my situation a whole lot easier than it is for a lot of people. I was afraid of being laughed off this subreddit the first time I posted. But this is one of the kindest subreddits I’ve come across and I can’t recall even one mean comment.

He said everyone can play a role in helping prevent another incident like this by letting police know when people are living outside.

“Look for those who are out on the street, under the bridges and in the tents, and call the police. Let’s not have another person die this year,” he said. “Telling the police about someone out in a field is not tattling on that person. What that’s doing is helping that person find help.”

Because nothing helps the homeless more than police intervention! 

I've been homeless almost 3 years now, and because I'm a panhandler I have to deal with the police a lot.

They buy the cheapest food for me while they eat out. It is from Bargain Market and always near expiration. Also they always stash good stuff away for themselves...Like I can't have a freaking cookie?? I applied for food-stamps but was denied.

etn1ym,2,addivinum,2,homeless,Loud Train Horns/Engine Rev Beneath Overpass,"I cant stand loud cars downshifting and redlining under highway overpasses. Same thing for Train Horn Guy.  Any pedestrian or homeless person ought to be familiar with this disturbingly popular occurence...


...........


I swear this Oath, as a Man of this Earth taking breath and carrying an immortal soul and standing beneath the unyielding Sun that relentlessly rides the sky;


I swear this oath, Upon the shoulders of all my forefathers that stood on this firmament before me, and gazing forth into the shadow of all of those who are to come yet.  


I swear this oath so that perhaps those who are yet to come may indeed have a better Earth to tread upon; for it is the sacred and unspoken goal of all good men to leave behind a better Earth than that which they found.


I sweareth this most holy and bonding, I vow unto myself, and swear before any witness that dare come forth:

Shall circumstances arise in which I am to become armed in the presence of anyone possessing a train horn on their vehicle or a muffler modified specifically to make it louder...should these circumstances come to be and I am fully and properly equipped, I will make such a war upon them and their blaspeming ilk that it shall never be forgotten so long as day turns to night. Long ere this day men will speak and sing songs in my honor, and women will tell tales in hushed tones of the day when the Great Shushing swept across the very world. 


NAY!! Never again shall the homeless man be awakened from an afternoon nap by the blaring and unrighteous noise of a train horn springing to life a mere fathom from their head.  NEVER!! Never again shall  a walking man be startled into jumping out of his very socks by the unexpected and sudden onset of a downshift into redline on a Shelby Mustang. THESE ARE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ITSELF... And to have this followed by the delighted and off-balance laughter of an overly inbred redneck because they think they're clever...Nay... this is an insult that no man should endure.  


I sweareth thus; None shall come walking after me that will be forced to condition themselves not to flinch in the least upon any sudden noise.  I SWEAR I shall be the last of this.particular breed.


THERE WILL BE ANGELS PERCHED UPON THE ROOFTOPS TO BEAR WITNESS AND BRING TELL OF MY DEEDS TO THEIR LORD, And Behold!  I SHALL ride forth stinking and intoxicated, clutching unsteadily atop my mighty Target shopping cart; wheels-a-wobbling, trailing broken earbuds and mismatched socks socks freely punching tickets for all comers to visit their maker in the life after this. And the first to fall! YES, that unlucky schmuck shall bear the unbridled wrath at its very moment of unleashing! In its moment of true perfection!  In this moment, the first to fall shall be bereft of his throat and voicebox due to an uncommonly well thrown malt liquor bottle! MICKEYS WILL IT BE AND SHORN OF ITS CAP IT SHALL ALSO BE FOR I HAVE USED IT AS A COOKER In the eyes of all who behold! LET IT BE KNOWN!


:;Evangelical:: I SAYETH I will ride forth thus, and I will bring their Doom unto them where they stand.  For indeed they will stand thus- stricken dumb with awe as they behold for the first time my mighty visage.  INDEED MY ASPECT SHALL BE GREAT AND FEARSOME , and shall appear to grow yet taller, and swifter, and more merciless yet, seemingly swelling with every voicebox I liberate from the throats of the unholy blasphemers before me.


LO! I will ride forth thusly, and almost all who ride with me shall join me singing the song of battle, while yet encumbered with enough ammunition to level a small nation.  All but Silent Joe, his being unable to speak and all. BUT GRUNT HE SHALL, AND ALONG WITH THE BEAT HE SHALL GRUNT! 


::Pained:: LO! Indeed I will ride forth thusly and I will perpetrate this holy war upon them and their wretched ilk and their black-hearted, misled and barren families and their rotten kin and their unlucky and lousy offspring until none are left standing- name none.  None shall pass unmolested.  NONE SHALL ENDURE MY GAZE IN THE HOUR OF MY COMING AND YET REMAIN STANDING INTACT BEFORE ME! There will be much cleaving and rending.  NONE shall carry an accursed bloodline through that darkened but most holy of days to see it emerge upon the other side and flower once more. NAY! From these evil works there will be no inheritance.. and none to inherit.


And yea, they shall ride unto their ruin atop Shelby Mustangs and Civics and F150 Raptors, with their horns a-blare and engines revving beneath the overpass... but their numbers will diminish. It is written thus and thus it shall be.  All the external radio speakers on this Earth cannot drown out mine fury and holy purpose.


::whisper:: O, Mother Earth shall weep indeed, but I shall wash away her tears with the blood of my lice infested and gout inflicted enemies, and soon shall spring forth Her own tears of joy for having been rid of an ill-begotten plague of noisemaking hooligans and drift-enthused ruffians. Many a cry of ""HOONIGAN!"" will die beneath a gurgle in the throats of those who stand accused.


I Swear it. And Ere the night falls, the very Earth shall fall silent, none shall hear a sound, holy or not, through the night that follows. Nay, none shall stir; Not even a mouse.


I am not the judge of men's Souls but I am the judge of their deeds  and I have declared myself thus, and Wo be unto him who stands in my way.  For I judge only those who perpetrate Noise unto others and use SOUND ITSELF it as a weapon!! Yea, The selfsame fabric that is woven into laughter and music  and moans of pleasure most carnal.  I will make this holy war on to them who have misused the gift of auditory communication until I shed my own Immortal soul,  I run out of ammo,  or I clean all trace of their very being from this world.

::beat::

::quietly:: I swear this.


One by one until none are left standing to tell the tale. Until Gabriel blows his horn;

Not posting my full name to comply with the rules here, but am happy to provide my name and email for anyone who feels uncomfortable commenting or doesn't want to DM on this site. 

There are a lot of stories having to do with homelessness that probably go untold. I wind up covering homelessness a lot on the West Coast, where it's most visible or where there's a lot of advocacy around encampments and shelter. I'm also working on stories about criminalization (tickets for panhandling or sleeping outdoors), sweeps, encampments, landlords taking advantage of homeless women in sex-for-rent schemes, etc. I try to follow local news and keep up with advocates around the country, but I always feel like I'm missing something. Is there anything that's going on in your community that you think deserves more attention? Is there anything you don't see enough of in the news, or see too much of, when it comes to homelessness? Are there any people you feel I should be keeping up with so I can adequately report on homelessness? Thank you for your time!",2020-01-11 12:47:57,2020,1,11,12,47,57

elwvoi,0,bugsy6780,2,homeless,An interesting person,"So I have been going to this methadone clinic because I broke my ribs and have problems with the disks in my back, I have bone deterioration and the disks in my back rub against one another... So, my doctor decided to stop prescribing pain meds for all his pations because of the federal crack down on pain meds... Any how, they told me methadone helps with pain management, so now I am on methadone that I regret ever getting on because it doesn't help with pain and now I am in a clinic that is for those addicted to pills, crack, heroin, meth, or what ever......... Long story short I met this guy with Parkinson's disease and am helping him out because he got evicted from his apartments and is about to be on the streets, so my wife and I took him in because he couldn't hurt a fly, shakes real bad in the hands so we can trust him... At the same time I  think he's using our kindness and I'm really pissed, I told this guy were already giving him a place to live, rides to the clinic everyday. What happened that really pissed me off was, he told me he had money to pay for two guys to help him move, so wife and I had two guys ready to help him move his stuff into storage  and the two guys were even going to get the uhaul and help him.... The day comes for his ass to move which was yesterday and we take him to pull the money out of the atm to pay for the uhaul, storage, and the labor wife and I had set up for him and he is negative 16 in his bank, so we had to call it off and figure out another game plan... I think this fucker knew he was broke and played us,  made us think it was all a mistake from orders he bought online and that it would all be fixed, blah....blah....blah...... I wonder if he just bought shit online and said fuck it, they will help me, I'll use my disease as a way get what I want.... any ways, so the game plan I had came up with was,..... He needed to leave what had at the apartment's  and just  bring his guitars and small exspensive stuff to our place and thats what the plan was going to be. We dropped him off and told him to call us when he was ready to come back to our place.. He called and after my wife got home  I told her to please help him out because I had just got the stomach bug her and our  daughter had, and I felt louzy and couldn't do nothing. I told her he was to leave everything besides his clothing and exspensive guitars and cats because I don't wan't her doing heavy lifting.... Any how, he used my wifes niceness to his advantage and ended up getting her to have her daughter and her bf to help and her boyfriend's parents, they bought some of his antique furniture so he could get a storage and uhaul, so my wife was helping him yesterday and is still helping while im sick at home watching our little angel daughter.... So we have his cats here too... I can now see why people get annoyed with people who are homeless and needy, because some use their sickness to their advantage, like he's doing to us... We already have a daughter with downs and autism....... Then he wakes up making racket at 3:30am looking for his cats calling my wife's name....I feel bad but I don't know what to do, at the same time he can't take care of himself...... I told the guy to leave his shit and just bring his fucking cats, now my wife is stuck helping him...... Be really careful when helping the homeless or someone about to be homeless because I seen first hand that they do use their disease's, disabilities, and their tragic stories to use people.....I am not a jerk, I am not complaining, it was just my wife yesterday and she works a job already and is tired, if I wasn't sick I would have said sure, let's do what we can to get his stuff into storage.... Then today he gets a attitude because we wouldn't take him to his ex wifes house to get stuff for him because were on a deadline to get his stuff into storage because the uhaul has to be turned in by 4pm and my wife has to find people to help because I am sick with the stomach bug taking care of daughter....",2020-01-08 11:44:58,2020,1,8,11,44,58

edmx91,173,ungelation,21,homeless,I clawed my way back.,"I became homeless at the beginning of October. It was a terrifying experience.. a young guy staring down the world that didn't care about me without a roof over my head. I didn't know what I was doing or where I would go. I had no family, few friends, and even less hope. 

Those first few weeks were brutal and terrifying. I was depressed and could hardly motivate myself to move. But then, more than anything, I just got angry. I couldn't believe I allowed myself to sink that low. So I fought. 

I worked day in and day out. 14-16 hour days at work back to back, 7 days a week. I wouldn't give up. If they had a shift, I'd take it. I stopped caring about my personal health, all I wanted was a purpose. 

But it paid off. My Christmas present to myself? I have an apartment now. Sitting in this big, empty apartment, I can't help but feel grateful. I did it. I clawed myself out of the deepest pit I've ever been in, and looking back nobody but me did it. 

I want to thank this community for always being supportive of me. Giving me tips, helping me keep motivated, and sending me good vibes. I never would have made it without some sort of support system, and this community was that. 

For everyone in the situation I was in; do NOT give up. Once you surrender, that's when it's over. You have to keep yourself moving forward no matter what and fight until you get what you want. 

You're worth it. You matter. The world needs your light. Keep moving forward, friends, and never stop fighting.

It will take 11 years to build, it will save billions of taxpayer dollars every year, and I believe the homeless will want to live there.

It will be similar to other cities with 150,000 populations, including a dedicated hospital, full healthcare services, housing, entertainment and activities, parks, and much more.

I know this is a big idea and might be hard to grasp – and some people will be quick to tear down new ideas and efforts. But if you can take the time to review the content in the links below, you'll see this is a well-thought-out idea that makes sense on every level.

If you like this, please help this effort and share on Twitter, Facebook, blog about this, or share in any other way. There is a crowdfunding campaign, but per the rules, I'll leave that link out for now.

I’m not bankrupting myself trying to take care of my abusive family.

I’m not working 65 hours a week to sink it all on being homeless.

I’m not spending 300 plus on booze.

I made it four years in and out of care without touching any hard drugs.

eark2q,82,throwaway1325494,24,homeless,My husband kicked me and my 2 year old daughter out. I have nowhere to go.,"Long story short, my husband brought an ex-con recovering meth addict into our 2 bedroom apartment. After three weeks of dealing with said ex-con's abhorrent inappropriate behavior with my husband egging him on and making my life a living hell, I decided I needed to formulate a plan to leave. My husband found out because he stole my phone from me while it was in my hand, and started threatening me. So I took my baby and left. I have no family in the area and no friends want to house me for more than a day.

I have a really good job that pays well, but I'm in the process of declaring bankruptcy, in part due to my husband's erroneously bad financial habits. In an already competitive housing market, no one wants to rent to me.

I am going to the women's crisis center when it opens on Monday. They offer emergency housing but hopefully they can help me find permanent housing.

 Any help or advice you can offer would be incredibly appreciated. I feel like I've hit rock bottom, especially since I'm putting my baby in this position.

UPDATE: I found a duplex with a shared kitchen about 2 hours away from where I lived before, which I'm totally okay with. My daughter and I are moving in on January 1st!",2019-12-14 17:06:07,2019,12,14,17,6,7

-I'm 23 YO male living in California-
I'm fucking torn, im sitting in my car crying my eyes out right now because I just got an email from my would be new employer saying I'm disqualified because of my background check. I been homeless for about a year now. Living in a tent during the warm spring and summer and now living in my girlfriend's car during these rainy seasons. I recently settled a court case that I was charged with by my ex(baby mama) from over a year ago. The charge was criminal threats with intent to terroize. Sounds pretty fucking terrible on paper, but anyone who knows me should know I wouldn't harm a fly. I could go on and on about how I'm innocent and how she set me up basically, but the case is closed now so it's no use, basically I got off pretty good given that the evidence was not at all in my favor and I'm a guy, she's a innocent little girl blah blah blah. I was only charged with a misdeamor instead of a felony, am on 3 years probation, have to do Domestic violence classes for a year all of which I have to pay for, nevermind the fact that I'm homeless and unemployed. So I've come to accept that it is what it is, I cant control certain things or people. So now that the case was all settled, I finally felt free to get my life back on track, start looking for work, I get an interview for a warehouse job, it goes great, she wants to hire me, all is well I fill out all the paperwork and consent to background check and drug screening. Few days later now we are here, I get an email from the employer saying I disqualify for employment based on the misdeameanor charge. Fuck. This job was the one thing I had to look forward to as far as my life goes. And it's not even like ""oh well there's plenty of other jobs out there"" no. This is a simple warehouse job , they are supposedly the easiest kinds of jobs one can get with a criminal background. So now what are my options? I have no money, what the hell are my options as far as getting work? I appreciate any and all comments that aren't judgemental or counter productive. And I'll answer any questions or provide information I may have left out if requested, thanks for reading.",2019-12-13 13:02:32,2019,12,13,13,2,32

e94yaf,89,coolchinesedude,15,homeless,Today was cold went to salvation army,"I was homeless now possibly have to be homeless again due to job changes transition. I was cold as hell 20 degree weather I didn't know where to go and the times for clothing coat drives at churches and other locations. I went to a salvation army thrift store that was not easy to get to. First the bus driver that let me on free sent me off said we past the stop. So I walk and walk and I realized the driver was wrong and in the cold weather did 180 and walked back. Kept walking finally got to the street the place is on. Phone goes dead so i don't know if it's notth or south. So I asked people and they guide me to the wrong direction... 

Again walked and walked and if your homeless walking sucks you got a heavy back pack your shoes sucks and your feet hurt. I got there asked the clerk if I could get a jacket or somethin and that I have no money. She said they had to be paid for... It's a stores after all and something that bothers me the way Salbs6 army handles donations.

I told her I'm really sorry I think your a nice lady your just doing you job. But it's cold I have to do what I have to do. I don't like to steal I wasn't raised like that but it's so cold I'm going to die and I have to do whatever to keep warm. I asked that I'm not good at stealing please turn a blind eye. She winked agreeing to what I was going to do and I love her for that. Instead of looking at name brands I'm looking for my size and down but there was none at I got the warmest I could get, scarf, hat, wish they had gloves. Put them on. Didn't even bother to be sneaky I even waved to the cameras and bowed my way of thanking and it's a Buddhist day too. The clothes made a big difference I was about to manage even without a down puffer. I will be back to give back to this lady she was great

Part 2

Little late to reply I actually did write one to thank you guys but I guess my fingers were so frozen and my phone kept dying. Im posting again because I need some help. I don't even expect it to happen but I will try anyways. It's not easy even here. If you want to scroll past my story which is actually just a half of what's going on I'll mark the paragraph with ***

I don't want to be homeless. I like to work. I worked in the suburbs of Chicago for 3 months. It was a pizza job but I did it well got a raise and promoted twice most recently to manager before I left the job for specific reasons. Pay was so low that even with 50+ hours a week with a little overtime I didn't make enough to enjoy a good life. My expenses was high without a car and really had to use my EBT. It's crazy how much I worked and I have nothing.

 Now I'm back in Chicago at the worst time for someone who is bad at being a homeless ""guy"" I'm bad at should I say I can't beg. The words can't come out my mouth. I'm great at customer service tech support greeting people. But to ask for food and money I'm not sure why. I'm pretty sure people will help me if I told the truth. Because that's how I am. 

I'm going to though some issues many that snowballed literally after Thanksgiving. With a little depression with my dad and grandma dead, family running off with their money, I have no family. The only thing I have to live for is unknown. I'm trying my best though.

So now I'm back in Chicago, trying to Polish up my resume to get me a job asap because it can take at least a week minimum to get something going... More to go realistic if I'm going can to IT work. I'm planning to shoot for something entry level get my foot in and work up. 

I walked the streets going to restaurant to even a 7-11 got a possible part time gig. But I have a couple of good opportunities but I'm having a few problems

My trusty old Nexus 6p that I used many years the phone is crapping out on me. I want to get a temp Android throwaway or anything I can buy and return until i can get a better phone refurbished. Without a phone I'm dead not just because i can't make receive calls from my long line of girls trying to hmu but I need it to get around using GPS Uber if needed transit apps, and like indeed Glassdoor Reddit apps. I also need some communication. 

I could use a month at a room which is roughly $500 in the North side area where I find pubic transit is better and not so hard on me when I try to ask for a free ride. Yes I ask. People hop turnstile im the oddball really that ask the attendant in the train booth along the blue line ""hey I'm homeless you think I can get on free?"" They just tell me just hop it.. I'm like really?"" I never done it before I see everyone side do it but I'm not a money.. monkey see monkey do type. So on the buses the drivers are more... unfriendly but mostly let you go but they tell me to put something in. Like pretend to pay ? I don't even know myself. I just put in like a penny a dime. Even a peso I found. The pace and metra on the other hand we really kind to me when I had no money.

Anyways back to my situation. I'm writing long paragraphs that ppl will probably not read but it's ok. I been holding back on a lot. So bear with me. 

******** What I need 
Priority is just a phone, unlimited data phone service the best I can get us the simple mobile 4g lte unlimited no throttle for $50 a month rent at a room, maybe a laptop if that could happen. I can do Uber I got a connect that this guy got me. He rents out cars for $200-250 I forget the extact amount. If I can do that I will drive literally as much as they will allow you to lol.

Im having issues with my medicaid or the ""free"" blue Cross blue shield ""community"" meaning your broke and you get the insurance that you have to wait months for a doctor months for a specialists. I have a doctor I pay just because before I was homeless I had to see him because my free Medicaid doctor retired suddenly.  So seeing this guy and getting the medication I need for insomnia is quite important. I can't sleep without medication and without sleep without a room without communication I might as well take a chance at getting myself killed chucking gang signs around Chicago

So in the streets Im like so bad at being homeless. So I'll try here

Any change for the homeless? Can you buy me food I only had a couple packs of ramen noodles a day. Can you buy me a phone? I'm trying to get room so I can shower wash my clothes get ready for a interview can you got one I can use? Can you help pay for my Uber car?

I'm not even trying to be a leech. I want to pay you back. I want to use #borrow but I don't have though karma but I'm Buddhist and I know I got good karma now and on the way. I even take notes in who helped me and gave them free pizzas from work. I don't party I don't got a girl and I didn't have time to go have fun for 3 months just focused on my job and thst was it. Boring but I'm in the burbs. 

I don't want a handout if you give me something you will get something back. Whether it's monetary , a thank you, something to show my appreciation. Not everyone is rich I get that. But I really could use a boost at this time. I'm not lazy I work hard way too hard. I'm decent with IT type work, and online marketing. I can manage restaurants, I could work sales. I think doing the Uber until I get the IT gig or both would be ideal. But the items I need.. the month room is really the minimum. I never ask for anything more than I need but that's how I am. To be realistic I will be a first paycheck to continue the 2nd month rent etc. If I can stability, ability to rest, stay warm not get sick, I can bounce back. 

There's more to my story the stuff the drama that's going on now and past that I'm trying to deal with. Like stuff from being ripped off to getting punched by some dude that is possible mentally ill just random. Little problem under my eye I haven't got that checked out. 

I'm glad I was able to write this without my phone dying. It's too the point where i have to hold it a certain way to keep it charging. It's so annoying because I got stuck in dangerous siuthatiions and areas when the battery was at 0. 

I just got my cashapp, i got the debit card sitting at the po box I got in the suburbs, Bitcoin is good it's getting easier to buy, if your in Chicago IL meet with you anywhere. Unfortunately I don't have PayPal, didn't sign up for vemo and the other apps. I just know ppl been talking about cashapp allot. The best way really is whatever is convenient for you. I hate bothering people and nobody wants to help people when it's too much work or trouble. If you have a way that you DM me and I'll sign up get whatever. I'm getting worried and I don't have anything or anyone to fall back on. 

Please help me. Thank you. If you can't it's ok too. I honestly don't think I will get any help because I never ask for help, especially like this. All I do is give give give give barely take. I have a blog for back when I first was homeless but will start updating it again. I hope it can help someone but I'm not a creative writer and I'm bad at pictures. But I want to document stuff because this is something thats going to be history once I bounce back.",2019-12-11 02:32:55,2019,12,11,2,32,55
e98v7g,3,jdawgsplace,10,homeless,Homeless sex offender,"All homeless people face similar issues, but sex offenders have a specific issue to contend with... Registration; and since most subsidized housing receives monies from HUD sex offenders are barred from services. The shelters in Houston is primarily Star of Hope, and their schedule is not conducive to doing day labor or any other kind of employment.

Fortunately, the SOR accommodates homeless sex offenders. Also, I figured I had the perfect solution; land ownership. So I found a cheap place and paid for it. Didn't anticipate having to contend with a local PD refusing to accept me into their judicition. So, here I am homeless in Houston... I don't do drugs, booze, or even cigarettes. I don't manage money very well but will save enough to hopefully get closer to my land... BTW, my taxes are less than $50/yr...

e62ypy,3,RantingHomeless,3,homeless,"Recently, a client at a shelter felt she was being discriminated against and that women deserved more than what was currently available.","This is a bit of a long read, but bear with me.

Disclaimer: I am not stating that women have it easier or harder than men, just that in my ten plus years of experience being homeless: women are treated differently. Usually with the benefit of the doubt or with more leniency than men. Also, it seems there are more programs/services to women that men do not qualify for. 
At the few shelters I have been at (from New Jersey, Connecticut to Michigan then Colorado) there is always womens underwear available (Bras and panties. I am not including socks) either the mens underwear is gone as soon as they get them, or it just isn't available.

Also, in Colorado they are at least 5 additional shelters (that I know of) and two additional programs that are not available to men.

We have medical personnel that come in twice a week but only ONCE a week do they see male AND female clients. Both nights are open to female clients.

Arts and crafts activities *exclusively* for women that men are not allowed to participate in.

There are about 10-15 women at this shelter with close to 80 or more men.

Since I have been at this particular shelter, I have witnessed these incidents:

Client ONE:
At about two months in, a man I have never met stayed with us and after dinner; decided to take a butter knife and disassemble a table. Mostly trying to pry off the laminate. Staff intervened and asked him to stop. With a dismissive gesture he asked them to stay away. A few of the staff kept him occupied until police arrived to escort him off the premises and he was given 30 days before he could return.

Other clients that knew him stated he wasn't all there mentally, yet this was the first time staff called the police (mind you they never stated if he didn't stop they were going to have the police involved) and this was the first incident that involved a ""weapon.""

Client TWO:

Incident one:
The cafeteria was crowded, and a man sat next to this woman. It wasn't ""rubbing"" elbows crowded as we had room between people that sat next to each other. The woman didn't like the fact he chose to sit next to her and asked if he could move somewhere else. He refused because, like I stated: it was crowded.

She didn't like that, stood and slapped him upside the head. Staff didn't witness this and because the man didn't seem to care as long as he wasn't the one in trouble, staff simply gave her a verbal warning. Later she had another altercation where she pushed another ""client"" yet the staff did witness and she was asked to leave with a punishment of two nights out (that night being one.)

Incident two:
Another altercation where she accused a man (not the same as the previous) of theft and decided to take his bag and dump the contents, looking for the stolen property. Again, a verbal warning was issued but almost immediately after the warning was spoken she got physical with the other client that she accused of theft. Again, asked to leave and given two nights out.

Incident three:
The same woman as the previous two incidents decided to throw objects that included, but not limited to: pens, pencils, chess and checker game pieces and a couple of books. After one book hit a staff member, she was informed that if she did not allow staff to escort her off the premises, the police would be called. She left ""voluntarily""  and was given 15 nights out.

When she did come back (this is hearsay as I did not witness) she was caught with alcohol and given a five night punishment. That was a few months ago and I haven't seen her at the shelter since.

Please keep in mind what you have read so far is not really the reason I created this post, just a few things I have witnessed in over a six month period that adds to why I was pissed off recently.


Now, to the point of what caused me to be upset and why I created this:


On Friday, a women who had never been to this shelter and had not undergone the intake process; was admitted and given a bed. 

The intake is just a short interview that is supposed to insure that you are placed into the correct shelter. I think.

Anyhow the time frame for the intake process is Monday through Friday (I cannot remember the exact hours, but it is at least 8 hours a day)

Monday night comes, again she has yet to do the intake but was still allowed in and was assigned a case manager.

Tuesday morning I overhear her complaining that she had to go clear across town for the intake interview and that she couldn't afford the bus fare. Apparently she has been spending her days at a coffee shop close to the shelter... spending money on coffee. 

I have walked from the shelter to that very same location on a nice day. It took me three hours. So I can understand her grief of having to (potentially) walk six hours round trip for (as she put it) ""A stupid interview when she *already* had a bed at the shelter.""

She argued with a female staff memeber that she felt she was being discriminated against for being a woman (her case manager is a man) and that it wasn't fair to ask her to ""spend money that I don't even have."" After being told there were no more free bus vouchers, she complained that she couldn't walk that far.

Yes, you read that correctly: Discriminated BECAUSE she is a woman.

HOLD UP, let's back up a bit, ok?

When she came in on Friday; IF SHE WAS A MAN: she would have been given one of those multi-fibered, too thin moving blankets that seem to disintegrate when put into a washing machine on the delicate cycle and be sent on her way. 
No bed Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday night until she had the intake process complete.

IF SHE WAS A MAN: She wouldn't have seen a case manager AT ALL until the intake process was complete. Meaning, she would probably have to wait another week to sign up for the programs.

Now, when I heard her bitch and moan later that morning as we waited for the bus, I got furious.  Even after some of the other clients gathered funds for her fare to take the bus ROUND TRIP, she was still complaining about being discriminated against and how men have/get more than the women and that homeless women should get more of EVERYTHING because....they are women.

I apologize to everyone but her that heard or is currently reading this, but:

""FUUUCK YOU!"" 

I am sorry if this comes off as chauvinistic, but if you feel that homeless women deserve MORE or should be treated BETTER than the homeless men...well...fuck equality, right?

e5izlg,7,whydidileaveohio,25,homeless,Do I leave Chattanooga? The city seems to have waged war on the homeless,"When I first was homeless came on this sub read up and chose Chattanooga because it seemed to have a lot of resources, the cops were lenient and it was a tourism town. 

Well I guess the tourism was up and coming because for years it was fine, you could camp pretty much anywhere.  There were multiple encampments that you could join.  There were charities that helped, you could get a solid two meals every day and the pan handling was easy down by the aquariam. 

Fast forward 5 years and the city seems to hate the homeless.  Multiple charities that used to help us have closed. I can only get one meal a day and that is if I can get into the mission which is at the edge of town.  They started a panhandling ordinance.  It is supposed to be against aggressive panhandling but even if i sit with head down and hat out - the police will get a complaint and come and move me. 

Two of my encampments got shut down by the city and we were moved.  I am in another encampment now, but it seems people have been complaining again cause the cops have been by and warned us. It seems that lately the local citizens are calling in all these encampments instead of just letting us be. 

I can't make any money. I can't rest for more than a week before getting kicked out.  And I can't panhandle. 

I also have seen an increase in violence against homeless in the city.  I know of 5 guys who got beat at night just for fun. 

How does a city change so fast? How could it be a mecca and now it is pushing us out? It still has a democrat mayor, but I do know gentrification is hitting this city fast.  a bunch of million dollar condos are were I used to sleep in a car (when I had a car).

e3z7ly,97,WhoratioBenzo,35,homeless,Journal: Hobo vs Homeless is,"I think there is a distinction. Most hobos I know walked away from their previous lives and picked this strange life. A lot of hobos are maybe mentally ill or alcoholics or both. Some are just eccentrics. I’m a hobo.  On the other hand, most  homeless I know identify as driven from their former lives and, at least at some level, wishing to return. Personal demons, tragedy, general bad luck preventing that. Something that bothers me a little about a recommendation I made in another post (“Whoratio’s Top 10”)- I don’t know how to link my post, sorry: Of my top 10 book recommendations I suggested two Steinbeck works. One of them is Cannery Row. I love the Cannery Row books and I reread many times. However, it does rather romanticize the hobo life. I’ll tell you it’s not romantic. I’m so cold this morning. I played with the idea of wasting money and taking the dog with me  to a nearby motel. Half a days work wasted that would be. But I imagined the luxury of a hot bath,  the heater blasting. I made a fire here anyway. I made sure the fireplace was safe here. My neighbor offered to get the electricity going somehow so I could get space heaters. Some kind of illegal hook-up. I have no idea. But I will tell you, that’s a horrible idea. Pretty sure the wiring in this house would be a disaster if it’s functional at all. Good way to die in a fire. I said no thank you. The fire is giving me and my 4 legged friend some heat. I didn’t have the stamina to cook out in the wind and chill today. I opened a can of beans and added a tamari pack and ate it cold. Not bad, though warm would have been better. My belly is full and so I can sleep. The retired Grouse hunter, aka dog, got his bowl of kibbles too. He lets me cover him with blankets. Unusual for a dog? I wanted to read, but I don’t have the focus. My heart is heavy for those with no shelter. I have protection from the wind, blankets and a weak fire. I fear for those with nothing.

e0yz4m,172,OceanWidePuddleDeep,33,homeless,I got my old job back!,"I called them weeks ago, along with all my other old jobs. Only left one job in my life on bad terms. I have the most experience beings a mover, and have talked my way into a job just over the phone before with my knowledge of the industry. Was pretty surprised I didn’t get a call back from any of them, but I understand if you got a full crew, you got a full crew. A few days ago I got a call from my old secretary and she offered me my job back. I asked why didn’t HR call me back, and she said she yelled at them for that, as she had told me I’m welcome back at anytime.

They hold a week, so three weeks will be my first payday. After 2 paydays I should be able to get a small bachelor apartment, or rent a room if I have to. I really, really want my own space though. If I have to stay on the streets longer to save up for it, I probably will. I’ve always done the rent a room thing. Just feels like I’m maintaining my life instead of growing it, if that makes sense. I have zero privacy as is, I need to be able to relax without being bothered.

Food before employment wasn’t a issue, as I could line up for breakfast lunch and dinner at the shelter. I usually spent my days adventuring for a job, and would just catch dinner. They feed you enough for one meal a day to do just fine. If I’m really hungry, I could take away from some job hunting time and get lunch or breakfast too.

Now when I work, I won’t be around to line up for any of the meals. My job is extremely physically demanding, and I’ll need to have the calories to keep it up. Tips are a possibility, and I can hit the food bank, get a sandwich here and there from the shelter...so I’m not going to starve to death..but doing 6-12 hour moves 5 days a week on a empty stomach for a month or longer is going to be hard. But I’m not worried, I got a job, I see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Once I’m back on my feet, I look forward to returning to the lines I now wait in with food and clothes. I’m going to volunteer at the shelter too. I feel I owe the karma gods that. It took me 22 days of constantly applying places everyday to find a job since becoming homeless on nov.1. I think by the start of 2020, I should have enough to get a place. I’m extremely lucky that I have my health, work ability, and no dependents, this I understand. I’m not trying to compare my situation to anybody, I just wanted to share some happy news with you all.

What are we supposed to sell these things for? A few meals? A few nights at a air bnb? How are we supposed to be able to land work, if we can’t be contacted. It’s not like they are going to swing by the shelter and leave a note saying where to meet tomorrow. They can’t track you down under a bridge to let you know the start time tomorrow. It’s just such a surface level way of looking at the situation.

And another thing, we deserve the down time on the internet. The only other socializing I have for me outside the internet is with people who can’t tell what planet we are on, so excuse me for trying to have a normal conversation with somebody. The general public seems scared of me so striking up one in person is hard.

There is only so much you can do in a day to find work. You have to spend time waiting in food lines if you’re hungry, or just simply focusing on not freezing to death. Ontop of waking up at the crack of dawn and walking like 15km a day. I check job listing every hour and send them my resume. That takes me like 5-10 mins every hour. I’ve already dropped off resumes within a area I can walk to and from, while still making it back by 9:45pm (when shelter closes doors and I’ll lose my cot). All this constant stress and hustle going on, and people still think I’m “wasting” my time on the internet. These are the same people that will sit on their ass on the internet from the moment they get from work, until they go to their comfy bed, but somehow IM the lazier one?

My smartphone is quite literally my main lifeline attached onto the boat of success. Without it, I would have 1 hour a day at the library to do everything, that’s it. How would having $100 in my pocket make that situation better? I can get food 3 times a day if I wait in line. There are ways to eat for free, at least where I’m from. If you go hungry, it’s because you were too busy to line up..but it doesn’t mean you’ll starve to death. I can live fine of one of the shelters meals a day.

And having little luxuries like headphones or accessories keep me sane. I’d probably get $50 for everything besides my phone. I rather be able to block out the yelling and screaming and snoring, as well as tune out the world for a bit and get lost in some music, instead of eating some unhealthy fast food meals or something. It’s like they expect us to get off our feet in the hardest possible scenarios. Blows my mind some people can’t understand this.",2019-11-16 16:41:48,2019,11,16,16,41,48

I gotta say, I'm loving it! My routine if I can't afford a hotel is to work if I feel like it, my job gets me tons of free food and keeps me going with gas. If I'm not working, I park outside a 24 hour grocery store and block off all the windows in the back of the parking lot. I can charge my laptop or my phone in the car or inside. I wish it were a little better on gas but I love the size of the cabin. I think I'll start traveling soon, but the $120 a week from plasma donations helps too much rn. 

I also shoplift a ton of food, though I hate that that particular thrill is upon me once again. When the money runs out, I have to eat somehow. If anyone has any idea how much it'd be to install solar panels for charging or who to consult for that I'd appreciate it! Also any tips on insulating my van to keep the worst of the winter off?

Protesters have only five demands and Chief Executive of Hong Kong doesn’t give a fxxk about these demands.
      
      I hate to be an Chinese (Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China) because the CCP is acting like a demon since it started in  1921 CCP doesn’t care about their citizen’s right.people in China have no freedom,if you have a religion,the government will send you to re-education camp and your organs might likely to be harvested(FaLun Gong) and transplant to officials or rich people (you can book an organ transplant surgery in China)🤷🏿‍♂️ btw Chinese people don’t even know about these things because the Chinese government brain washed and block informations about it from Chinese people and they don’t even know that they don’t have democracy and are living under a Totalitarianism

    The reasons I like U.S is that it’s democracy and freedom(and legalisation of weed).U.S citizens have the right to vote FAIRLY and I’m pleased to see that U.S accommodate different races and cultures.

      I don’t want to be a homeless in my China or Hong Kong because older Chinese people believe that being a homeless represent laziness and  shameful. I won't say that I’m smart , but I won't be stupid enough to know what I am doing.

I also can’t get help from the state or SSI. I don’t have a fuzzy animal that people fawn over. What I do have are kids. Lately my usual spot has been taken over by someone in a wheelchair, with a dog, and claims she gets an SSI check. I want to make a sign stating that she’s eaten and my kids haven’t cause I know it’s true. I watch her get in 30 minutes what could feed us for 3-4 days. 

When I say usual spot being taken over, I don’t mean I go there and oh she’s there. I mean we are sitting there and she shows up, looks at us, then goes ahead and sets up anyway.

So, anyone know anywhere I can try? Not naming my usual place for obvious reasons.

Update: I spoke to her. Only reason she did that was because she truly hadn’t gotten anything earlier. I asked her to just let me know and I’d pull my sign for a bit. She agreed to do that and apologized for usurping my spot without talking to me about it first. I also managed to get snacks and something to drink too.",2019-10-02 11:09:22,2019,10,2,11,9,22

It's been a really messed up year of failure and the past couple months have been especially stressful. You never really understand the homeless situation until you've been in it. How terrible shelters can be. The constant stress and lack of freedom. Still I managed to get out and find a place to stay without waiting forever and just trying to improve or fix my life everyday. Even with crippling depression and anxiety I still tried. I met someone with a room, explained my situation and they let me rent it. I still have a long way to go and tons of other problems, but at least I have a place of my own again. Don't give up.",2019-10-01 15:52:48,2019,10,1,15,52,48
dbpczf,0,772194,5,homeless,Could this actually work?,"Here me out. This might sound hard, but it could work if your desperate enough.

You purchase a $90 domestic ticket, sign in 24 hours before, stay for about 23 hours and 30 minutes, then leave, then re-sign in with 30 minutes left (you have to sign in with a ticket from united/partners or this wont work) and get another 24 hour perk.

You can buy $550 yearly subscription fee. So if your willing to pay $45 a day plus $5 a day and get all your amentities; internet, shower, computer access, rest area, showering and the other bunch for free amenities this is actually a possibility.

For those asking why you don't go out and buy $500/m apartment, there is no such thing in my area as it's really expense, plus I want to live in metropoltian area. If you live in San Fransico or New York City which has insane rental costs this is a viable alternative. Also, with the miles I'll be racking up, I can take a yearly vacation probably roundtrip for free.

dc1dfn,1,lotanto2,8,homeless,Have any of you lived in an office building?,"I am not homeless and never have been, but if you are homeless in the suburbs, office buildings seem like decent places to live as long as there is no security. I am not talking about renting an office, but I mean like living in the hallways itself. Some office buildings have couches, outlets, no crowds, and sometimes you can sneak into office kitchens. You don't even need dress clothes to be in office buildings. You can be there every day and people would not know and people just mind their own business. The issue is sleeping and dealing with the cleaning staff. Best part about office buildings is that people can and have slept in their workplace before.

Office buildings are nice and private too. You can park a car on the parking lot of an office building and cops won't ticket the car. I've seen work vehicles park there overnight. 

Oh yeah and speaking of not wearing dress clothes, if you have dress clothes, you could actually wear them to wedding halls and sneak food if you cannot afford food.",2019-10-01 16:54:25,2019,10,1,16,54,25

d9acbx,0,lotanto2,2,homeless,My 20M cousin's story of being homeless living in his car out of choice,"I know I've probably written this in my comments throughout this subreddit, but I am going to fully explain my cousin's (20M) story of him living in his car out of choice.

My cousin lives in the SF Bay Area. My cousin was a 19M at the time. He also had a girlfriend (probably 19M at the time) at the time. First, his dad (my uncle) kicked my cousin out of the house, because he didn't want to go to college or get a job. Then, my cousin went to live with his mother. His mother offered the girlfriend to live with them due to her having an abusive family she was raised under, but when they went on vacation together, the girlfriend was rude and my cousin's mother decided to kick her out.

My cousin and his girlfriend ended up living in my cousin's car out of choice for a year. My cousin worked at Baskin Robbins at the time.

Who bought the car and paid the car insurance?

Not sure who paid the insurance, but my cousin said he did buy a used car for a super cheap price, but of course it was a long time to have the money saved due to having minimum wage jobs. 

Where did he park? 

In California, you can park on the streets overnight legally. My uncle is a very laid back man and let my cousin park on the street in front of his house.

How did he shower?

Well, my uncle was nice enough to let my cousin in whenever he wanted to shower. 

Did he have a cell phone?

Before my cousin was kicked out of my uncle's house, my uncle paid the phone bill. When my uncle kicked him out of the house, he cut off his phone from the service and my cousin did lose his phone. He is lucky his friend let him  keep an old iPhone, but my cousin can only use wifi. 

I wish I knew the other details like groceries, water, etc.

My cousin is very extroverted, so he spent most of his days hanging out with his friends like vaping, vape shop, skateboarding, rocking out with his guitar. His spending habits are awful and he spends ALL his money like crazy and that's because he has no desire to move out from his parents later in life (lucky him). 

So basically his homelessness ended when he broke up with his girlfriend, but my uncle did let him back in, so now my cousin is back to normal at going to both my uncle's and his mother's house.",2019-09-25 16:07:48,2019,9,25,16,7,48

d24dyw,126,tragic_magic_world,33,homeless,I miss you already Aaron,"This post is a tribute to my friend I met here in this sub.  Aaron and I met when he was requesting a sleeping bag resources. I ended buying him one and then we became Reddit friends. We don't live in the same state and I am not homeless. An act of kindness on my part developed into a platonic email Reddit friendship. He taught me how one small thing can tumble someone to the streets and the struggle that follows. He tried so hard to stay positive despite being robbed, arrested for simply sleeping and just trying to claw his way back. He worked and was a great guy. He was so kind, smart and caring. I looked forward to his messages. I prayed for his recovery everyday. He could never figure out why a suburban housewife who had everything would give him the time of day. My answer each time was ""why not ?"" He recently committed himself to a hospital for depression and was out for a week. He was taking medication and still couldnt beat his demons. His last act on this earth was to write me a  note so when they found him I would never wonder why he went silent. To the homeless person who was kind enough to find his note and instructions, I will be forever grateful. I don't want his suicide to go quietly. I want anyone feeling down to seek help. Let his pain and death help others. Depression is disease. Please please seek help if you need too. He would be so humbled by me even writing this post. He thought he was nothing. But I know he was  somebody. A good person who deserved better then what he got. Aaron my friend I will always remember you. I hope you found the peace in heaven that you could never find here.  I am so sad and have cried for hours tonight. Below is the last post I read today and found out that he died. I know the post was long but Aaron and everyone reading this are worthy and people who deserve kindness, compassion and no judgement as we are all children of God. To my friend A A Ron rest well. I miss you already.

Today we lost Aaron. He took all of his medication with a fifth of vodka. He left you a note. ""Rhonda, I'm sorry we never met. I imagined you set in the sun. It was nobody's fault. I was what I was and couldn't accept that. I wanted to see beauty in everything and all I saw was everything ugly. I hope you can forgive me.""

d15owr,131,bigglypiggly,72,homeless,Open Letter to Starbucks Corporate from a homeless student,"Please consider starting a program where students can show an ID &amp; get some sort of sticker or tag for their car that alerts security they are paying guests of your establishment.  This request is born out of my humiliation, frustration, &amp; fear after yet another Starbucks-contracted parking lot security guard threatened me today.

Well dressed students with their MacBooks sit twice as long as I do as they study for their tests; some only “purchasing” free water in exchange for the privilege.  Their late model automobiles take up space in the parking lots &amp; I have never once seen security peek in their windows.

I spend only as much time as I need to complete an assignment &amp; always purchase a paid beverage.  At nearly every Starbucks location I have frequented, within a week of not even daily visits, I have to pack up early when I notice security knocking on my windows.  

Today, I was not even in your store for half an hour when the guard - apparently not even wanting to step out of the car - starting beeping his horn &amp; yelling, “hey! Hey!” to my rear window.  I tried to leave without being noticed &amp; he confronted me loudly saying he had photos of my car &amp; the next time he sees it there, he’s going to tow it.

I tried explaining I was studying &amp; he cut me off saying I was squatting.  He mocked me &amp; said, “why do you even need to study at Starbucks, you’re homeless?”  I said I never stay more than 3 hours & always have a receipt & he just kept repeating I was obviously lying to squatting because his guards have seen me on all 3 shifts. 

I am really hopeful this reaches someone with influence.  Starbucks, your staff has been incredibly kind to me.  Even though I can only afford brewed coffee &amp; my tips are small, I have always been treated with respect at every location.  Outside your front door, though, the companies you are hiring to sweep your parking lots clean of undesirables don’t share your values.

I am in tears often because your business is not the only one contracting with these services.  I’m not allowed to sit in my car &amp; eat a meal I just purchased &amp; I am not allowed to sit under a shade tree &amp; cool down in triple digit sun &amp; I am not allowed to attend group meetings at your establishment without security photographing my vehicle.  Please recognize they aren’t just threatening to tow a car, they’re threatening to force me onto the street.  

Please help create some sort of policy that allows me to exist with the same right to park as other customers.  I am not likely to be the only other person in this position.  Please don’t be one of those corporations that acts concerned in the spotlight &amp; is ruthlessly instructing these sort of practices in the dark.  

Thank you for your time.",2019-09-07 21:05:03,2019,9,7,21,5,3
d0j01e,87,abstractstrategy,16,homeless,in honor and memory of my brother wendell,"My dad was not a nice man.

His name was [Warner Wilson Baldridge](https://www.yourfriendgrace.com/uploads/9/7/8/8/9788529/warner_orig.jpg)... I think. I'm actually not completely sure. After spending the first few years of his life thrown into, out, and around countless abusive foster homes (and being kicked out of a native american boys school for beating another kid nearly to death), he lied about his age (and his name?) and joined the army as a teenager. I think he ended up getting kicked out of that, too.

Throughout his nearly 70 years of life, he had a number of children with a number of women. I was the last to be born (in 1983) and before he died in 2005, I tried to piece together as much of his tragic backstory as I could to make a list of at least some of my half-siblings.

​One particular anecdote stuck out to me and struck me the hardest.

My dad told me that he'd had a son named Wendell at some point in the late 1950s. I'm not sure at what point Wendell and his family were abandoned by my dad (or perhaps when Wendell's mother escaped), but I do know that at some point in the late 1970s, Wendell showed up at my dad's door.

My dad realized very quickly that Wendell was gay, so he physically assaulted him, told him 'no son of mine is a fag', threw him out the front door of the house, and told him to never ever come back.

I have met and spoken to a number of my dad's children, but I could never find Wendell. I was able to locate his mother and brother, but they told me that they had not heard from Wendell in decades.

""The Story of Wendell"" became a fixture in the back of my mind. I wondered if he had changed his name. I wondered if he'd found a home somewhere. I wondered if he'd found a partner who loved him. I wondered if he loved music. I wondered if he was funny. I wondered if he'd found peace and had broken the cycle of abuse. I wondered if he was still alive. I wondered how I was ever going to find him.

I needed to find him. I needed to tell him that it wasn't his fault. I needed to tell him that he deserved so much better. I needed to tell him that there was nothing wrong with him. I needed to tell him that our father was a sick, sick human being who never made peace with his own trauma and just inflicted it on others as a twisted coping mechanism. I needed to tell him that he was loved.

​I needed to tell him that I loved him.

Then came [this message](https://www.yourfriendgrace.com/uploads/9/7/8/8/9788529/published/mom-chat-wendell.png?1567612443) from my mom.

Wendell was found dead a few days ago on a beach in California.

The coroner said he'd died of pneumonia.

I had so many questions.

​Was he with friends? Did he have a partner? How did his mom find out? Where did he live? What had he been doing all these years?

​When more than a week went by and no answers arrived, I began to realize that Wendell may never have found a home his whole life.

​His mother sent all the photos she had to the funeral home and they put together [a video memorial](https://www.yourfriendgrace.com/uploads/b/9788529-369299740468043538/wendell_tribute_921.mp4?fbclid=IwAR0IuAEvp9WJbDDWwWzM6KPhN1lUzkWxISn2kMKfVGxowYRGHs1KQT0MA0k).

I wept when I watched it. I'm still weeping. I will never stop weeping.

He was 59 years old when he died, but the last photo of him on the memorial video is from when he was 24. His mother did not have anything more recent.

​No one did.​

We failed Wendell. We failed. And we know it.

And we will always know it.

And we deserve to let that failure fester deep into our beings. Because there are a lot of Wendells in this world and we're walking by them every day. And we're failing them, too.

Being named in [Wendell's obituary](https://www.yourfriendgrace.com/uploads/9/7/8/8/9788529/visaliatimesdelta.pdf) is and always will be one of the greatest honors of my life. ​A man who I never met. A man who never even knew that I existed.

It is hard to wrap my mind around that fact. Wendell lived almost 60 years and \*never even knew I existed\*. He never knew there was someone in the world that was cheering for him every day for years and years. Someone who knew his name. Someone who was thinking about him all the time. He never knew that there was someone in the world who spoke of him proudly to friends and strangers with great wonder and hope. He never knew he was being searched for. Someone was looking for him.

And it wasn't just a stranger. It was a sister. His sister.

In a seemingly barren world, he was not alone. He had a sister who was so proud to say he belonged to her family, both biological and chosen.

You had a home with me, Wendell. You still do. You always will.

I will continue to speak your name as long as I live and I will see you in the eyes of every stranger that I meet. We may have failed you, but I will not fail them.

I love you, my beautiful brother.

p.s. I recorded a song for Wendell's funeral this weekend and cried the whole time I was recording it. Then I noticed a setting on my microphone that I had never seen before called ""extra singer"" and when I clicked on it, it added a parallel vocal track that sounded like a male voice.

My ankles would hurt, my legs would shake, and a pain would shoot up my leg from my foot with every step I took on those stairs. 

As the days past I noticed it was harder to concentrate in class and on my studies. Today I found out my school has a food pantry where you can get 2 items per day. I was shocked to see that little metal gray cabinet so full of snacks! I grabbed a protein shake and stick of beef jerky and it felt amazing to be giving my body what it needs. I even found it slightly easier to focus today during class.

Then I decided to give a food pantry near me a shot because I heard they will give out fresh produce. Since I’m in a car, I can’t cook anything and was so grateful the woman understood my situation and gave me bananas, strawberries, lunchables, on top of other items.

cvak8q,0,bannedbyall,3,homeless,Odd post because I own a house outright,"I am fleeing abuse from my brother and parents.  My brother wants me dead.  

I realized the USA and Canada are going Nazi right now.  And because my brother got me briefly committed for 43 hours of a 72 hour hold as I tried to flee my city... for being ""violent"" and accusing me of wanting to kidnap his kids, when all I did was email a few people close to him, showing how he abuses them and his NPD.  And I am antifa, and continuously post against Nazi's.  And I get accused of being ""violent"".  

I can't change my ID.  I was in poverty owning a house.  I bought a used car.  To move with.  And I can't make myself go change my ID.  I literally never, ever feel safe.  And I can't ever trust police or the medical system or politics or my government ever again.

I keep trying to calm down, pretend any of this is normal.  Somehow I have like $ 200,000 in assets.  But most of it is tied up in the house and car I bought.  

I am in such terror and feel homeless and waiting for the police to come to lock me up in a mental word... really for being ""too sane"" about how shitty the world is.  

I am pretty sure North America is going full Nazi within 12-24 months.

I don't care about money at all.  I have been dirt poor.  I hate owning this house and living in it alone.  $135 k for a big house on a half acre in a city, across the street from a river.  I love this place.  And I kind of want to give it to the homeless shelter, or make it into
A detox for the massive meth/opiate problem in my new city of 15,000.

I am losing my mind.  With a ton of money.  And assets.  I literally just want no one to know where I am.  I am not prone to being paranoid or living in fear.  I am 44.  I am not scared or poor people or addicts or immigrants or any regular person.  I don't even care about locking my door.  But my con man NPD brother has $20 million from legal cons, and the only thing he seems to care about is destroying my life.  And the government is evil.  Corrupt and doctors in mental health care are garbage.  I am not even really mentally ill, just under constant trauma for 40 years.

How do I run away and never use the internet or my ID again?  Or how do I stop living in fear and start living?  Or how do I make my house a shelter for others?  

Feeling homeless in your dream home... while being so much different than being actually homeless.  It is the worst mindfuck ever.  All the evil won't ever let me be happy or ever feel safe or free.  Ever.  

Like... every aspect of my life was a lie, my family, country, the ""people"" around me... really are pretty freaking easy Nazi converts.  

I don't even know what to say.  I mean to a homeless person maybe I seem the biggest asshole ever.  But if somehow you escaped endless trauma, abuse and poverty with $200k.  And 2 and a half months later... all you can think about is being homeless... to hide out, despite having money.  I don't even want the money.  It feels like blood money.  I just want to be free of fear and somehow help anyone who has been rejected by society.  

I gave away a lot of money.  Pick up litter.  Tried to go to church.  I just can't be right or feel safe or part of anything.  Everything seems corrupt except truly desperate people.  They are the only people, that get freaking anything about being alive.  Every middle class person is a sell out.  Really.  I feel I am... while I am not really yet.  

I hate owning this house.  I hate living in fear.  I hate that my neighbour's and local church's act like the poor addicts are scary, while billionaires destroy the province.  One family... Irving.  Yeah it is New Brunswick.  

I know I have money and most of you don't at all.  I was happier before... being so house poor and broken I was in poverty.

I can't stop being in fear of the police coming to lock me into a pysch ward.  And no one helping get me out.",2019-08-25 10:23:51,2019,8,25,10,23,51

cptnhz,768,throwawaypointone,86,homeless,My dogs protected me last night.,"If y'all saw my last post, I still have no where to go. I've been staying in my car with my two dogs, in a parking lot of McDonald's during the day. I stay in the parking lot of a hotel during the night. I've gone in for water for the pups and myself, plus I have free wifi and no one really questions me if I stay around for awhile. I haven't gone in today because I'm only 16 and I don't want people asking why I'm not in school, plus it's hot and I don't want to leave the dogs in the car too long. 

Atm I'm in a more seedy place of town. Last night I was putting down the seats (I have an older GMC) so we could sleep in the trunk and stretch out. I had gone to the dollar tree and bought blankets for us so we have a place in the back to sleep. A dude who was obviously drunk stumbled up to us and right off the bat I got nervous. I had parked in the very back to avoid interactions like this. Anyways, I don't know wether he had ill intent or what, but I asked for him to leave. He didn't hear me and said ""what did you say little girl"" while moving closer. I immediately turned towards him, I didn't want my back facing him, and blocked my car, repeating what I said. The dogs had been pretty quiet at this point, but idk if my oldest dog picked up on my tone or what but she slowly started growling at him. The puppy raised his hackles and he also shoved his head over my shoulder to look at the guy. The dude immediately put his hands up and apologized and left. My dogs were on edge for the rest of the night, getting up to look out the windows and huffing at people who passed. 

I didn't know where else to share this, I'm just proud of them and glad that at least someone has my back. These dogs will protect me, and last night proved it. I may be in a shitty situation, but it could be worse.

conre8,3,Toxisky,1,homeless,"The Problem With ""Bubble People""","A ""bubble person"" is the name I'v given to someone who've lived in a bubble their entire life, never having to worry about the problems of the real world because they've had everything given to them for free. Bare in mind that the people who live in society today wouldn't magically all decide to have a society if they were born in an environment that didn't have one to begin with. These people merely leech off the works of others and try to change the laws to regulate things against their own people who become homeless. Money doesn't just come to you because you worked hard.

&#x200B;

I'm going to be strait forward about this without being disrespectful toward people who actually need financial help or a platform of some sort to get going. The only reason homelessness is still a thing today is literally because the average first world citizen that isn't homeless, wants it that way. It makes them feel like they have more power over others and or are better then a group of people other then themselves even when they aren't in many ways.

&#x200B;

Let met explain where I come from. I live in Texas. Californians, New Yorkers, Chicagoers, and Coloradians all come to Texas to buy cheap houses. The entire reason they left in the first place is because they the prices on housing was too high, yet they then try to gentrify the first neighborhood they go to and change the laws in the states to oppose people who are homeless. How stupid do you have to be to make your children homeless like your parents probably did you, then go and repeat the cycle somewhere else? Gentrification doesn't magically get rid of peoples needs for petroleum, food, and distilled water. Changing the laws to make things the way it was where you came from just means you should have stayed where you were in the first place because you've literally brought where you came from with you instead of making it better for yourself.

&#x200B;

Most people I know in Texas that aren't homeless, live with their parents. The only people who can afford a house as ironic as this is, are foreigners and that's because they have better social networks then people born in the first world that only have to get on their computer to try and get what they want and never have to socialize with other people. Most people homeless today will almost always remain homeless due to the change in their personality thanks to a lack of non-toxic social networks in their life. Let me say this. People are killers out there and the killers aren't the people who don't have anything. Every killer lately I hear on the news that committed homicide on a stranger, came from a wealthy family. People who commit homicide in the street almost always know each other.

ccs2im,101,Hidden-Atrophy,17,homeless,I have a pet bird apparently (Uplifting story),"So I flip between staying in a motel and living in a little wooded area. Life has been getting rather depressing; especially when my co-worker announced she was closing on her new home in three weeks. I'm not jealous, she is a good hard worker and I'm proud of her and her husband. But I am rather lonely and despondent. So anyway; on Tuesday I went home to my tent. Sometime during the day a bird had built a nest in between the top of the tent and rainfly. It's not inside the actual tent, just inside the little alcove between the two. I think that's cute, so didnt destroy it or chase it off. He's quiet, not a lot of twittering, and often flys out from under the rainfly to return later. I crumbled some potato chips and left them out, he ate them while I watched. Or it could be a girl? I don't know. All I know is for several days now I've had a sweet little brown bird living in a nest above my tent, and I've been feeding it chips and cookie crumbles. He even came up to me while laying in my hammock, and I held out my hand but he hesitated. He didn't fly off, just kind of looked at my hand and ambled back a bit. It's adorable, I'm feeling better mentally because having a little bit of life; even if it's just a bird; reminds me of the beauty in the world. I don't feel so lonely because I can come home and see my bird after work. It's like having a cat or dog; some feeling of happiness I haven't had in ages. I put a container of water out for him to drink/bathe, and plan on buying actual bird seed to eat rather than chips. Don't laugh, I'm just sharing the bit of joy I've found while being homeless : )

&#x200B;

Two years ago, fresh from a traumatic breakup with my then-fiance, I was accepted to an MFA program 1.2k miles away from home. It seemed like a great way to start over, and I accepted. The program offered full tuition remission. I used a credit card to pay a first/last/security and moved. My boyfriend came with me, although we had not been together long. I was grateful for the company and he was facing homelessness himself at the time. 

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks after moving, my excess financial aid hit my account and was one tenth of what it was purported to be via communications with the financial aid office prior. I call them, get a rude woman who tells me to suck it up, I am not getting the money. Several people dropped out due to this the year I was admitted. They lied. They said tuition was covered, and they lied, using a loophole to wiggle out of repercussions. (I still think I could have filed a class action lawsuit, but I was in over my head at this point.)

&#x200B;

Boyfriend and I get jobs. This was around September, both retail positions. In December, after months of fighting management to keep to my availability, I fall ill and miss work. I am let go. Soon after, my boyfriend gets the same illness, exacerbated by his allergy to cinnamon, which he was forced to work around in the bog box retailer he worked for. He gets even more ill than I was and I couldn't get out of bed or lift my head. He loses his job in early January. 

&#x200B;

Through this time, I actually had two jobs, the retail one and one through my program that pays a pittance. We use that to scrape by until May. Both of us are trying to find a new job, applying constantly with no luck. In June, we get the eviction letter. 

&#x200B;

For five months, we scraped together every penny we could to keep ourselves off the street, in airbnbs. The sick thing is to do that costs more than rent would cost us, but we can't save enough for a first/last/security. We both got new jobs, but it took a long time. He applied for his position in October and didn't get hired until January. I was working three jobs to keep us barely afloat during this time. Trying to get to my job was very difficult, as my car's brakes were in bad shape. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, my car became totaled (we think by a snowplow as it was sitting on the side of the road during a friend's get together and then smashed when I came out.) I lost one of my jobs because I couldn't make it in. During this time, we happened to be staying too far from the city to use public transit. 

&#x200B;

In January, we chose a place that was managed by a guy we had stayed with before in one of our better airbnb experiences. He offered us a chance to stay long term, paying $500 biweekly. We were still scraping, but it was working, and we even had a little saved until my car got totaled. That happened in early February. 

&#x200B;

We had no formal contract with this guy, just a verbal one that we would stay until at least September. That is, until the end of April, when he decided he was giving our room to a coworker. He gave us six weeks notice, but it wasn't enough to save \~3k for a new place. I was still in the process of getting rehired at the job I lost, and this also coincided with an error with my school job's payroll that meant I was not being paid for three weeks. (I truly detest my school's financial practices and encourage prospective students to go elsewhere, despite the program I am in being truly exceptional.) 

&#x200B;

We were to be out by June 1st. A little before Memorial Day, I overdosed on my depression medication. Without a car, I knew the homeless life was going to be so much more difficult and I nearly didn't survive the last time. Airbnbs have gone up two-fold since then, as well. 

&#x200B;

I ended up throwing up the medication (I don't remember this) and surviving. Some days I am glad. Most days I am not. 

&#x200B;

The day before we were supposed to leave, I told the guy we weren't leaving. He never provided us with written notice, and I was going to use that legal technicality to buy us some time, though I hate confrontation, hate being that person, and detested myself for it, I was desperate. To get us out, he paid $500 for a new place to stay for two weeks. 

&#x200B;

We are in our fourth week of homelessness sans car. It is a different experience and terrifying not having the car as a backup place to sleep and stay safe. 

&#x200B;

I cannot get into a shelter. I have called relentlessly. They only accept battered or pregnant women, women with children, or drug addicts. There is one place in my area that does a lottery system. They have four or five times as many people as they do beds available. 

&#x200B;

We haven't had a proper meal in over a month. We eat once a day if we are lucky. We can't transport food from a food bank. We leave every week or two for a new place and cannot take it with us. 

&#x200B;

There are resources available, but for once reason or another, we don't have access to them. I've been trying to get to the SNAP office for a month and either can't afford even a bus ticket or have been crippled by my mental illnesses and cannot make it there safely due to them. (I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, and a tentative borderline personality disorder diagnosis.) Living mentally ill is hard. Living homeless mentally ill is insufferable. 

&#x200B;

I have two jobs. One in a retail field that doesn't begin until August, and one in my career field that begins in September, a position I was incredibly fortunate to acquire. And I think I have to give it all up. The guy who reneged on our agreement told us he would give us his other room on the 28th. I panicked and told him we wouldn't have the money (someone gave us $300 is the only reason that changed when the time came) and he gave it out to someone else. He claimed we could have it on the 5th, but it is nearly time and he hasn't answered texts. 

&#x200B;

I am so close to being able to be okay, but I can't afford housing from now until my paychecks arrive. I am still applying to other jobs in the meantime, but I worry about even being able to get to them or having clean clothes to wear for them before I get paid. 

&#x200B;

I have one year left in my three-year program. I have come so far to just give up, but I can't survive this. 

&#x200B;

I have friends here that I hate to leave. I haven't made the friendships I would have liked to with these people, because I feel like a burden and the humiliation of homelessness causes me to be unable to relate. I will still miss them if I have to go. 

&#x200B;

If I go back home, I am also going back into a situation that I fought like hell to get out of. My anxiety, at the time undiagnosed, caused me to drop out of high school. It took seven years to get myself to a place where I could go to undergrad. And now I have made it so far just to have to fold and go back into a home situation that will cause my anxiety to worsen, and in fact, is the root of my disorders. All of them. I am terrified to go back there. 

&#x200B;

And finally, if I leave, my boyfriend cannot come with me. My mother won't allow him to move in with her, too. It's a five-room house and three adults and two toddlers already live there. Though that isn't even really the reason. But it is a reason why I do not want to stay there. He and I have our problems, but he has also been my primary (and sometimes sole) support system through this. And he is the only person in my life that remotely understands. I also would be leaving him to continue this alone. It won't be much cheaper for one person than it is for two, so there's really no comfort to be had there. And I feel like scum. He has no family. I am it. No one can help him but me and I can't anymore. I won't survive this. I already almost didn't. He hasn't said much about it. I told him I might have to leave, and he shut down and I shut down, so the conversation didn't continue. He works full time here as well, and doesn't want to quit without notice, either.

I am not ready to give up my entire life, and what very well could be my entire future. And no one gets it. They all have this wishful thinking ""this is temporary"" attitude. Because it is too horrifying for THEM to face up to the fact that this can happen to anybody. That a string of setbacks can set you back so far you never recover. 

&#x200B;

I know people think I could be doing more. That there is a reason I am still in this situation. And if I wasn't also severely mentally ill, malnourished, and just generally tired all the time from all the emotional labor, the physical labor, and the near-constant humiliation and terror, maybe I'd be able to get out. But those things are a part of it. It's easy to sit in your air-conditioned living room and think of all the ways you would ""fix"" this. I did the same thing before. I never understood why homeless people were homeless. Now I get it. 

&#x200B;

All I want is to be able to be normal. To have a place with my boyfriend, work toward my career, finish my program. To be in a position where I can help others in this boat. To help prevent anyone else from going through this. 

&#x200B;

If you made it through this very long post, I thank you so much. I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm a few days away from having to make this monumental decision that I am in no place to making either emotionally or mentally, and I am suffering in silence for the most part, because I am met with so many ""why don't you just \[X\]"" that I isolate even more.",2019-06-30 15:07:23,2019,6,30,15,7,23
c5ejld,4,11hbliss,16,homeless,Lost,"To start this off, I am a mother of three boys. I am a daughter to a family I constantly disappoint. I came here to vent.
For the past two years we have lived in a motel. Yes, a single bedroom with three kids. No, I don’t do drugs. No, I’m not trashy, nor a prostitute. I am a mother struggling. My fiancé works a low pay job and his money goes to rent and things our kids need. That’s all we have enough for. We aren’t able to have extra money to save up to get out. I want out so bad. I want a house, or apartment or even a camper! Anything is better than here. I try my best, but, lately I feel it’s not enough. My kids are young, six and twins that are two. Nobody will let us rent a two bedroom because “we have too many people” for a two bedroom. And a three bedroom is too expensive. *eyeroll* I would be happy with a camper. Anything but here. I don’t know anyone around besides people that come and go from the motel and the owners. 
I have no one to help watch my kids so I can’t get a job. I’m 25 year old. I feel like a complete failure. I want to make my family proud. I want to get out.",2019-06-25 14:19:26,2019,6,25,14,19,26

I’m worried about food. I know we’ll be eating out a lot but I’m worried about nutrition.

I’m worried about storage. My job requires “business casual” which translates into ironed dress pants and dress shirts. Where will I hang things? My car is TINY. 

And above all, I’m worried about child protective services. I’m leaving an abusive situation (please please don’t offer me resources, I have no evidence) and I know they’ll be called in retaliation. Homeless moms don’t automatically lose custody of their kids, right?

Thank you..","I asked a simple question on /r/askreddit and it blew up more than I could have imagined. People began messaging me so much I eventually gave up replying.  A few years ago my girlfriend passed away right after a medical discharge from the USAF. (I didn't want to share at the time)This sent me into a a dark and spiraling depression with drugs, alcohol, sex, depression, everything. I wanted to end it all. But this tiny bit of hope may be what begins the turning point in my life..

Thanks to their kind gestures and words of encouragement, I have been trying to better myself. I am still financially unstable and struggling with my depression. However, Reddit really changed my perspective on the human spirit.  I *can* do this.. I *can* use my willpower and change my life for the better.

I just dont know how to thank you guys enough.. I still want to end my life occasionally, i still struggle with tempting drug related thoughts. Still struggle getting out of bed and clearing my head. But things *are* getting better.  There *is* a modicum of hope. And that one seed planted might have been the base for the tree that is myself to grow as a human and help others as well.  
My dream is to become a Social Worker, or run for Political Office, just want to help others. As I cannot make myself happy. I might be able to for others. However, my depression made this task seemingly impossible.. However, maybe I *will* tackle life and do it regardless. I believe in myself again thanks to the community. 

Thank you all again for sharing that life can and will get better. No matter how dark of a place you may be in. I love you guys. You truly may have saved my life..  I really was planning on suicide or homelessness before that post.. God, you guys are just so wonderful when it counts. I'm tearing up just thinking about how *much* Reddit can care..

  First up, I went down to a bar crawl area where college students are enjoying their lives and I watch cause well fml...

Immediately this beautiful Asian girl starts spitting game at me (Said she was drunk from 7 shots & a smoke) we kiss & this boosts my confidence! Sadly her friend ""Saved Her"" by pushing her into a bar...You ladies literally came out here to do this but w.e.

feeling a bit accomplished, I decide to walk around a bit to clear the area & run into my long time gay friend who had a crush on me in Highschool. 

I'm not gay but I've learned so much of how to pursue women from him because of how he pursues me & I had a lesbians mentor in my early hs days they were the best to take notes from!

So they bring me along & we eat this awesome dinner although I wish I could pay them back, it was a life savior they didn't realize. 

We continue the night hitting on local women making them feel flattered, hell one woman even took of her ring & claimed she could take us on, so I danced with her & hell she had moves it was amazing!

Night still young, about 11pm, my friends had just depart. Now after a bit of roaming I walked past some garbage and it was full of bakery from the local shop's. I went to Duane Read & got their largest bag then back to the garbage.

  Well after checking if the coast was clear.

I exchange as much as I could fit into the Duane Read bag yet they toss SO MUCH FOOD! Loaded up, I begin luggaging around the bag to the local homeless feeding them. I had a great night.

I'm not sure, how much I walked...Yet I walked a whole damn lot with this heavy bag. My fitbit read 37K steps however much that is. 

I got cheered on a few times which made it more fun but this Santa Claus got fed up with picky homeless people not wanting his bagels, so I went to another store right on time & got their dump of fresh pastries. Also I stopped asking if they wanted it & just placed it near them.

 -------------- Here's Where I Need Advice ---------------

  As I was handing out the provisions, a well dressed baller looking guy was having a convo with a homeless guy. I walked over did my thing & dropped a bagel and pastry.

  Turns out this guy was baller, interested he asked what am I doing, why, who, where & we talk. He loved everything I was about! (I keep telling my family that, I'm pretty cool yo).
He exclaims ""Your gonna make it"", I keep hearing that, it gives me +1 hope but man I'm in some poop, we talk more & more.

  Excited he gives me this fancy shiny card (I'll take a pic of it for you guys) apparently he's a Realtor & works for the biggest of dogs & wants me to interview at Trump Towers. I've some clue of this stuff but I've no background, yet he asks for my resume & CV.

 We depart, I'm still loaded on goods but needed a rest. I stop by a 24/7 subway, they allow me to rest after just a bit of my Santa Claus adventure & why I had so much pastries lol... 

  Now I begin contemplating goals, after I woke, which I'll ask here...
 
 I had the idea to sell the pastries eventually making a low cost sale business for NYC morning rushers. Most people I've asked told me exact times to show up to grab their batch which is so nice of them. Yet this is a resource I can do better with.

  I've barely much experience with Real estate yet I've dabbled around and I'll study my ass off on it. Now this may be odd yet I want to fabricate a resume (I'll make sure they understand it's not real) yet study my ass off & prove my fabricated experiences. It'll be an interesting way to tackle my inexperience.

  My dream is to learn computer science yet I'm doing it pretty inefficiently with outdated books yet found a way to do it all day at a computer store, should I focus that or side it learn it bit by bit?

b7nx2z,148,praisetohomelessvets,37,homeless,Just laid to rest a family member who had been homeless for thirty years,"Danny was the father of two kids, husband, Marine Corps veteran of Vietnam.  After the war he struggled with mental health issues and depression.  He spent less and less time engaged with his family and work.

It's unclear how much treatment the VA provided him.  It is known that he was non-compliant with his medications.  

One day, he just walked away from it all.  No more fishing trips with his children, no more government job, no more house in the suburbs.  He chose a life on the streets.  Or his brain chemistry chose for him.

The children didn't understand, but there was no one there to explain it to them.  His wife, an immigrant didn't come from a culture that believed in mental illness.  She thought he was just ""no good"".  His family from West Virginia, including his mother and brothers, had untreated mental health issues of their own.  Self medication through alcohol seemed to be common.

So Danny was just gone.  What daily struggles he endured in the following decades will never be known.  

The story doesn't end there, though.  His daughter eventually grew up and had a child of her own.  That connection spurred her to reestablish the continuity of her own family.  She posted requests online looking for any information about her lost father.

Years went by and finally her efforts paid off.  A social worker in a neighboring state had met Danny on the street while doing a survey for a government-mandated push to address the homeless population.  By googling the name they found the daughter's requests online.",2019-03-31 07:47:04,2019,3,31,7,47,4

azt1xw,9,Montage_Hustle,14,homeless,Sue or not to sue?,"My ex injected illegal amounts of heparin into me which has caused many side affects that I've keep under wraps to protect her and her title.

My mother was extremely abusive which caused me to do anything to please her to keep her within my life. This ultimately lead to me doing anything to keep loved ones within my life.

My ex had failed her NCLEX-RN twice and another failure would result in her illegible to retake the test within the states. She came to me for study help. I made flash cards, I made campfire like songs for long medical words and I played medical terminologies as she slept. 

She passed. After, we had immediately hunted jobs and landed her a role in dialysis. One day she brings home a tiny jar which had insane warning labels. She had never given an shot to anyone and wanted a scapegoat. I had told her ""No"" yet eventually while off guard she had poked it in my thigh as I was lying down. 

I just had to lay still as this happened. I'm still suffering from the long term side effects. My coworkers realized my changes yet I tried my best to stomach them to keep the job. It began with chest pains, then eventually a heart attack. 

Heart attacks do not run in my family, I am very athletic. I was admitted to Mount Sinai hospital and my doctor was confused, especially for being so young. I wasn't vaccinated for the flu so after the hospital visit I had gotten the flu. I was bed ridden for too long, lost my job and my ex ran off to Cali, I was left to survive on my savings. 

Today I was able to connect the dots. 2 symptoms creeped on me. My left eye felt lethargic and my right leg is a bit swollen. Left sided heart failure. I'm extremely athletic and my diet is healthy as well. Yet the symptoms follows even the chills.

I made an attempt to chat with her to get her professional opinion, yet she blocked me on all outlets. The symptoms don't seem too potent or so, I've began running to pump the heart, if any medical prof. reads this let me know if this is ideal.

Lastly should I sue?

So The Who was all there at the time was is me=me M=mom MF= moms fiancé and FS is fiancé’s son /background so my mom was just proposed to the day before this and was in a a happy mood we were in Chicago so I was deeply wanting to help one or something and my mom knew this

So after say 4:30 we when to some deep dish pizza place and after going had a big portion of pizza left and didn’t have a fridge in our hotel one guy a Homeless old man said he wanted peanut butter instead even after saying it’s deep dish and very soft so we figured we better not give it to him

After some more walking (pictures of trump tower) and going to the bridge and taking photos over the water at night we came across this one nice homeless man MF”hay man would you like this pizza we just came from a place 10 minutes away and were giving it away homeless man”dude thank you it’s very hard out here (it was around 15 degrease and cold) M yea can’t imagine what you go through so we hand him the pizza and walk about thirty feet and we see the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever seen a homeless man with two animals a middle sized pit bull terrier and a pure wight cat sleeping the dog awake now our hearts drop as we realized that if we waited 1 minute we could of feed the dog,cat and man all with the one pizza all of us sad my MF hands the dude a twenty and tells the guy they just gave a pizza away and was very sorry

The thing that eases me is that the next day we saw the guy and he thanked us for the pizza but I still feed bad for the guy with the pets

so I had posted in here before about needing a place to park my RV in Colorado.  

Thanks to several people here on reddit I made a call to a park and told them my situation. The owner was very interested in what my plan was and how I had gotten into my situation . once I spilled it all to her she agreed to give me the space for a low price , in exchange that I watch her shop over the summer when someone called out. She also asked to do a background check and if I was comfortable taking a drug test to make sure I’m not addicted to anything ‘hard’ . She had also asked a few questions about my little truck that has been to the shop more times than I can count and offered to help move my trailer if my truck couldn’t handle the towing capacity . 

That was a kick ass deal so of course I agreed . 

Yesterday she calls me and she said my background check came out squeaky clean, and the other stuff I said also checks out so she wants to help. 

Her and some of her family gathered the funds to buy me a newer SUV and two car seats so I could safely get my kids around town and myself to work. She said that she was moved that I never asked for anything out side of ‘an honest exchange in return for honest work.’ She was in a similar situation at my age and wanted to be the help she needed at that time . 

I was taken compeltely off guard and didn’t believe it at first, but I called the dealership and it’s ready for me to pick up Friday. 

I’m going between waves of overwhelming joy and gratitude , to absolute fear that this somehow won’t happen and I’ll have to deal with another emotional loss. I’ve been incredibly dilligant on rebuilding my life with my own means so no one can take it from me ever again. 

I know that this experience has made me want to help someone else once I’m in the position to do so. I guess I’ll count my blessings and just hope for the best . ",2019-02-13 08:35:10,2019,2,13,8,35,10

What's the mentality behind this?! As a homeless dude I don't like to carry more than is necessary for me for what I'm doing. Fortunately I have a car, but even when I buy another item like a blanket or sleeping bag, I get anxious because that's just that much less space I have.

afp9j7,2,TyroneMcThundercock,3,homeless,Sleeping outside vs insects and air pollution,"I'm routinely in and out of homelessness. It's for mental health reasons and I'm fine financially. I have access to mental health care and I can't do much more in that department.

First of all, the concerns that drive me to sleep outside my flat prohibits me from taking refuge in a shelter or any other kind of 'housed' temporary accommodation. Even if it was alone like I negotiated with a temple to sleep there overnight, I wouldn't feel good or safe. And, simply camping in the country or somewhere isn't gonna help. I don't understand why. I don't understand my issues too well but as I said, not because I'm not putting my all into it. I just need backup strategies.

One of my issues is OCD, which has a different interplay with my homelessness situation. It stacks with a phobia of insects. I'm ghastly afraid of a cockroach or something slipping into my ear, nose or mouth while I am lying down outside. I am also frightful of general air pollution dumbing me down. I can't get good rest knowing those risk but I have found ways to handle other issues like the cold or risk of random violence. I can handle the general dirtiness of being outside, however.

Any solutions? Face respirator masks are unbearable for long periods of time particularly if you want to sleep. Even if I found some structure to sleep in like an unlocked toilet, they're not well sealed and insects crawl all inside those places. In a good house insect infiltration is minimum of course, but if that was a definite option I wouldn't be asking.

It also seems like the tent option is plausible. They are well sealed. On the downside, it only solves the insect problem not the pollution. The main problem is that tents sacrifice visibility of the outside of area. Having that situational awareness seems vital to be safe on the streets. If someone could get so close to me I'd only know once they shake my tent up, I'm a short stride from being stabbed and or robbed. If I had a transparent tent, sure others may i intervene in an attack but more likely someone can see I'm not alert to the danger. 

I don't really know what to do about this situation. Can someone please advise? Thanks.",2019-01-13 16:18:49,2019,1,13,16,18,49

a3aske,151,KidneyStew,28,homeless,"To the ones that like to give out care packages to the homeless, read this!","I know a lot of you like to put together care packages for people experiencing homelessness. If you're one of those people, good for you! You're a great person for doing what you're doing. Helping people in need is such a great deed and I have nothing but respect for the ones who do. But as a homeless person myself, there are a lot of things that are hard to come by that no one really thinks of. 

For example, when I first officially became homeless in August, I caught a nasty cold. it was literally torture, I was coughing my ass off to the point of vomiting. Cold medicine is nearly impossible to come across when you're penny less, so consider adding cough drops, travel size tissue packs, cough syrup, small bottles of Vicks, Benadryl, and nasal decongestants. They can truly be a lifesaver. 

Some areas have places for the homeless that provide ibuprofen and Tylenol, but a lot of them don't. Many homeless people walk wherever they go, and after so long on foot, you get severe leg and muscle cramps. Consider throwing small bottles of Tylenol and ibuprofen. They can really help. 

Another good idea is candy. Not chocolate or other things like that, but suckers and hard candy. Whenever I was starving and couldn't eat, I would suck on some hard candy and it would help with hunger for a little while. 

Tampons and pads!! You can get them free at a lot of places, but sometimes the unexpected could happen. For example, one night at 11 PM, I started my period. It didn't start on the day it should have, and all the places that provided those things were closed. I had to use toilet paper and it was GROSS!! So definitely keep that in mind for the ladies. 

If possible, vouchers for Goodwill and other thrift shops. When looking for a job, you want to look nice and have clean clothing that's not all tattered and ripped. 

Some other items include individual packs of instant coffee, hot chocolate, or flavored drink mixes, a book of matches, cheap mini flashlights, bug spray, (depending on the season) a small tarp to lay on, extra pairs of socks (after walking a long time your feet will stink. BAD. A pair of panties or boxers, because you know, accidents can happen. 

Good ideas for snacks include crackers, granola bars, protein bars, (they keep you fuller longer) sunflower seeds, instant tuna packs, and I've seen these little boxes in stores where there's egg or ham salad that come with crackers and a little spoon to spread it with. They aren't expensive either! 

Then the basics. Soap, toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner, razors, shaving cream, deoderant, comb, baby wipes, first aid stuff, maybe a backpack or some sort of bag to carry their things. 

As for winter time, a hat, gloves, scarf, jacket, blankets, etc. 

Also, it's a good idea to put a small note of encouragement in each package. Something short, sweet, and motivational. It could really go a long way.. trust me. 

Thank you to everyone who takes the time out of their day to help those in need. God bless you!! ❤️",2018-12-05 02:34:31,2018,12,5,2,34,31

a08x6x,1,rabahi,61,homeless,Why do so few homeless people make money online?,"Hi everybody,

I hope I don’t come off as rude because I have a really sincere question.
I‘ve always wondered why the people who live on the streets don’t make money online. There’s libraries in every city and for many you don’t even need a library card to use the computers and wifi. I know that many homeless people don’t have the skills for some online jobs (although they could learn them using the internet or books) but everyone can fill out online surveys, you don’t need any skills for that. They could easily make hundreds of dollars a month if they spend 8-10 hours filling out surveys. So why do most homeless not do that? ",2018-11-25 07:34:53,2018,11,25,7,34,53

A quiet soul, minding his own business but I know his story. He was a tattoo artist before addiction took a hold. He is at the same shelter as I was. During the recovery meetings, he drew pictures with water colored pencils. He is in recovery and fighting hard. I saw the the artist inside him, working on a dragon's face, fierce with fire flowing from its nostrils. I know he likes coffee. 


I saw her on my way to the gas station  on a cold afternoon. She gave a gentle nod after we made eye contact. I remember being glad she had on a warm hat. I shared a mat next to hers some months ago, and remember her breathing out a sigh one morning when the lights flicked on at 6 am. 


I saw another today at Walmart. She was still in colored pink hair, beaming. She was kicked out for being late one night. But she says she is okay. The conversation starts the same each time. She has a new boyfriend, again.


Maybe for some, they are the hidden homeless. But I'm glad for me, I know some parts of of their story. I saw their faces, know their names and know who does and doesn't like coffee. They might not remember me, but they are not forgotten or background noise. They are not forgotten.

She was living about 50 miles away and I would see her about every two week. I have a part time job and she just barely got a job and one worked one day for about three hours. Hardly a job if you ask me. She can do alot better. Her mom kicked her ass cause she was having a depression episode.  My gf also has ""depression"" and I can see why. Her mom and dad (divorced) both are heavy drinkers and just been on her ass non stop. Her whole family is always against her and always side with each other. I am a very ""spiritual"" person as in studied alot of esoteric shit. I don't think she's depressed, I've seen it before with one of my cousins. They have one little episode and they force fucking meds down there throat. I'm not arguing about that. Jusy saying. When your living with a drunk dad and brother who always fuck with you(her) and your forced to go live with your(her) mom, and she is litterally depressed too, like, she can't do any wrong type shit, and gets so mad she fucking beats her grown ass daughters ass, and kicks her out with all her shit in the street and fucking talks to me, like homie this and homie that, flexing on me. I can see how my gf is ""depressed"" she obviously is around this chaos all the time. Her only options were live with drunk dad and brother or live with depressed mom who hits you. So of course I went and picked her up. The only time my gf has really gotten me mad was when she was staying with her dad and litterally talked like her mom. I never knew till her mom flex on me say bro this and homie that. Now I see where that came from. The only fights we have are about how she doesn't want to be there and i was always like you have to. It's your only option, but after she was attacked my her own drunk mom and here mom came at me all crazy.  I said enough is enough and picked her up with all her stuff. We're staying at a friend of mine. The whole family are my friends. The mom's a major in psychology and now a k-2nd grade teacher and the dad's a doctor. Money is no option here. I'm here rn too. We are in night two. I have work in the morning and I will be returning ""down the hill"" with her tomorrow and luckily my work is really cool and she can be there with me while I work. But my friends live about 20 miles up the mountain where there are no local jobs. She would have to try to get a job in the small town where I live down the mountain.  Hardly any jobs there too. So maybe even the next town over is the only place age could find a job. I have a car, not very reliable car, at that. So she has a place to stay until she gets on her feet but no transportation.

994p7j,676,SuperGayLesbianGirl,39,homeless,Don't give people money on here!,"Seriously, there are other subreddits for that. 

Lately I've been coming across a lot of *very similar* posts on here that are soon taken down asking for money. These are a violation of **RULE 4**, which exists for a reason. **THERE ARE OTHER SUBREDDITS FOR THIS.** This is not the place to go to try to extract money.

There are typical REDDIT SCAMS that work exactly like this. Don't fall for them!

When you go to somebody's userpage and [it looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/OyBvDWy.jpg), that's a **red flag**. Be smart. 

This particular account is a new account, 1 month old, is not a verified email account, and has not been active on reddit except to ask for money here and there. No real reddit history. All **red flags**.

There's a post requesting $350, which for some reason is a popular amount for these people to ask for. As it almost seems like the same person creating all these accounts.

Like I said, there are other subreddits to go to to ask for assistance and *this is not it*. When you go to their profile and see that they've been requesting money on those subreddits and their posts keep getting removed, there's a reason for that. **Red flags**

I saw what appeared to be at least two people on here last night who looked like they ended up giving this person money, and a couple others who were upvoting. WHEN YOU GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF A DOUBT it's just giving this person an incentive to keep creating accounts and coming back.

THIS IS NOT ALLOWED IN THIS SUBREDDIT. If you need money you don't really go to the homeless to ask for it. A lot of us in this subreddit are struggling ourselves and a scammer will pray on that fact hoping that they come across to user that has been in that situation before knows what it feels like. These are the targets and these are the people most likely to give money.

**HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO INSTEAD OF GIVING SOMEBODY MONEY**

* Give them resources in their own city. Food banks, shelters, etc...

Be suspicious of any reasons why they say those aren't options

* Point them to the appropriate subreddits.

r/assistance

r/borrow

r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza

If they say that they aren't allowed to post, again, **red flag**.

**BE SMART**

**REPORT TO A MOD**

In the outdoor seating areas of all the trendy new cafes

You can see the yuppies drinking their cortados and lattes

And you can hear them as they're chatting and laughing out so loud

Must feel good to be in the In Crowd

Must feel good to have such idle conversation

About the latest 1980's Spotify compilation

Yeah I got myself a phone but the battery is spent

'Cause there isn't any outlet to plug into in the tent on the sidewalk

Listen to them talking – the lawyers and ITs

Sometimes I really wonder if I'm a member of their species

But I grew up in this city and now I can't afford to live here 

Can't afford to spend ten dollars on a pint of beer

Can't afford to lie down on a bench and take a nap 

I'm lucky if they let me in to use the john and take a crap

Don't write me a letter, there's nowhere to get it sent

'Cause you don't have an address when you're living in a tent...

Often when I'm downtown selling papers I see

Protesters protesting the powers-that-be

Maybe I should join them but I don't think I will

Because whoever runs the Congress or Capitol Hill

The only thing that changes, whoever's hands are in the larder

Everything gets more expensive and life keeps getting harder

The one and only thing that matters is I can't afford the rent

The sky is pissing freezing rain, the walls are leaking in this tent...

As I lay here on the plastic, shivering away

I'm just hoping that I'll make it to the break of day

Not just be a statistic who died face down in the mud

Beaten by some frat boys, covered up in blood

Sometimes I dream I have a future – an end to this long night 

Sometimes I dream that someday people will have rights 

But then I wake up and I wonder what the hell that meant

8gdm24,0,gurneyhallack,0,homeless,The other favorite song.,"This is a sing for those with housing, who must accept what little is handed to them, and bow for the privilege of it. It is called ""names and addresses, by Dvid Rovics, on Youtube.

Wednesday morning

no one knew

what was in store

fire started

quickly spread

till it covered

every floor

stairwell blocked

no way out

smoke and fire

all around

parents grabbed 

their little babies

dropped them 10 floors

to the ground

people cried

to no avail 

twenty four

stories tall

engulfed in flames

the fire ladders

were just like toys

no use at all

there were no sprinklers

few smoke alarms

fire extinguisher

out of date

all repairs

if ever done

always too little

too late

when ? They believed

housing was

a human right

but all that changed 

now if your not rich

you should be kept

out of sight

out of sight

out of town

wrapped up neatly

plastic clad

the flats may all

be falling apart

but at least

they don't look too bad

the residents

had tried to warn

the authorities

for years and years

but all their letters

all their blog posts

all their calls

fell on deaf ears

council housing 

taking space

left to rot

for by and by

it would someday

be turned to dust

in a forward march

to gentrify

but in the meantime

if people perish

with their children

in their laps

its the price the market

has to pay

to house the poor

in firetraps

if this was murder

87p6h8,3,Mediocre_Zucchini,21,homeless,Homeless hatred,"edited version: I wanted to use the bathroom and have a place to sit for a while. When I went in, I might have even said, ""If I buy something, can I use the bathroom?"" I got a yes. I might have taken a bit longer in the bathroom than was normal.

After I got out of the bathroom, I went to buy something, like a hot chocolate. It was a cafe. It has just opened, and I was the only customer there. As soon as I get to the counter, the girl asks me if I'm paying with cash, because THEY HAVE NO CHANGE.

This was like a tipping point for me in my experience of homeless hatred when I was homeless. The passive aggressive level of hatred made it much worse.

In case anybody can't understand the story, the girl refused to serve me because I was homeless, with an excuse that they could only take card at that time because they had NO CHANGE for cash. Most people know homeless people don't have debit or credit cards, so a convenient thing it was that they had no change at the moment.

In case anyone was wondering, this was north of Seattle, one of the worst homeless-hating cities I've been in in my whole time being homeless. The only worse is San Francisco.

In order for anyone to truly understand the homeless experience, you have to understand the amount of hatred you put up with. For me at least it was not the worst thing to go hungry and to sleep outside, but it was the level of hatred you got from so many people.

Edit: The devil is in the details...which I left out. It was the very beginning of the day. No cafe is going to start the day without any change. It was a somewhat nice cafe at that. You also have to look at people's attitudes. Most people didn't think I was homeless when they first saw me, hence her letting me use the bathroom. But upon second look, it can become apparent. It is hard to convey people's attitudes in a reddit post, but you can tell from people's vibes if they're being nice (and yes, that happened a lot) vs. if they have ulterior motives. So, maybe not the best reddit post, but don't think you can judge what happened based only on a cursory impression from the post. Besides the larger point is that the prejudice is rampant, whether or not you like my example. That's the larger point.",2018-03-27 22:39:49,2018,3,27,22,39,49

* 1) I have no friends who are willing to help
* 2) I have no one to stay with

I know this is perhaps my own mindset but I no matter where I am, there is always people I can stay with in most cities. And whenever I am able, I try to help my friends in similar positions. At once point having 15 keys to my places given to my friends. 

Sadly and understandably, people in those positions of financial uncertainty isolate themselves and hide instead of trying to pay it forward. And they choose friends who perhaps aren't healthy for them. 

* 1) Choose the right friends
* 2) Drop the friends who aren't healthy
* 3) Keep being out and being nice to people
* 4) To have good friends, you must be a good friend
* 5) Stop giving yourself excuses on why you are miserable, do something about it

Perhaps this is rather mean... I am stayed rather quiet on this page but read through to see if there is someone local I can help.

The letter below I have sent to all my Congressman and Senators, and also to no less than 10 news stations. Hopefully someone will rectify this outrageous situation and abuse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I am writing you because of a matter that is occurring with Dutchess County Social Services (Specifically Adult Protective Services) Elder and Human Rights Abuse. That I thought you might be interested in as a human rights story and also abuse of an elderly disabled person. This story needs to get out to the public what they're doing to me and others.

I am elderly, over 60 years old and disabled on SSDI (social security disability) and currently homeless. I am also transgender LGBT. I called adult protective services to help me out due to I was involved in a bad domestic violence abuse situation and had no one else to turn to or help me. They placed me in a homeless shelter/motel in Poughquag NY called the **name removed**  Motel. I have been here now for over 3 weeks and have been denied essential services by social service (adult protective services) I have been forced to live with NO clean clothes (all my clothes are filthy dirty) and they refuse to give me access to any laundry services to wash my clothes. There is NO laundry services in this area as the so-called homeless motel is in a VERY remote location with NO access to laundry services and NO way for me to get to one as I cannot drive due to my disability's and there is NO public transportation available either.

( I am basically a hostage and a prisoner here by social services own doing ) with NO assistance from them what so ever. I even have digital phone recordings of them telling me they will look into it and then also them telling me there is nothing they can do, to deal with it. On Friday I now found Bed Bugs in my bed and room, I was getting the hell bitten out of me. What did social services do NOTHING absolutely nothing. I had to call the health department to report it. They are suppose be out this week to inspect it. In the mean time the owner of the motel refuses to also do NOTHING about it.

Is this the way our state agencies treat the elderly and disabled? Obviously so, because they're doing to ME!!! and to others.

I have brought this up no less than 4 times to my case worker **name removed** from adult protective services and she just ignores it and keeps telling me she will ""look into it"" and does nothing about it. I am now starting to breakout in skin rashes due to having to wear filthy dirty clothing. I have an immune deficiency disease due to my many disabilities and fear this will cause me other medical problems.  I also have crones disease which requires me to eat a specific diet.

The motel room they placed me in has NO stove to cook with and just a microwave to heat things up in. They also do NOT supply meals of any type. I cannot eat processed foods and pre-packaged foods due to my crones disease and have NO way to cook the foods I require to help manage and control my crones disease. I have also brought this up to them and I get no response from them but ""we will look into it"" and nothing is done about it. I also fear that most of this refusal to supply me with needed essential services is due to me being transgender and LGBT and discrimination to due it.


This is elder abuse and a violation of my human rights of an at risk disabled person by social services/adult protective services, and them not giving me access to and denying me essential services to maintain my health and hygiene and putting me at further risk.

Please I beg you to help me out with this abuse and get me the essential services I require and have a right to..... Please HELP ME, I am begging for your help!!!!

83qyns,3,Heartofjoy57,19,homeless,More Homeless Shelter Hell - Loud Music/Alcohol/Drugs,"Ok, so last night starting about 8:00pm I start hearing VERY loud rap music or as I like to refer to it cRap music. Anyways the music is so damn loud it is vibrating all the walls in the motel. I had the TV on and couldn't even hear it due to the loud obnoxious music. Barring the extremely loud cRap music, they were hoopin' and a hollerin' and talking so loud it echoed throughout the entire place.I didn't say anything till about 9:30pm when I couldn't take anymore of the music and very loud partying. Being me and not a confrontational person I did what I though best, I called the owner/manager of the motel and informed him of the extremely loud music and the very loud talking and hollering that was going on. He told me he would address it. I was in my room and I could hear him knock on their door 3 rooms down and tell them to turn the music down or else. Well they turned it down and not 5 minutes later the cRap music and partying was back in full swing and now louder than it was before.

Now I can start to smell marijuana stench coming into my room and the entire hallway reeked of it. So I called the owner/manager again and voiced my disdain and anger over this behavior and disrespect by the other people here. (Mind you we are all here from DSS/Social Services and in this homeless motel shelter) So now it is about 10:00pm and once again he knocks on their door and tells them to turn it down and to be quiet. Nope...that's just not going to happen, as soon as he was out of earshot the cRap music and loud partying resumed.

So I sit in my room perplexed as what to do about this,(wanting to get some much needed sleep) as it seems asking them to turn the music down and to quiet down was not going to happen. (obviously they're above the rules and law and don't give a shit about others in the motel) So I sat there thinking and I decided to call the owner/manager one last time and tell him PLEASE get these people to be quiet and turn the music down and to quit being so damn loud. He tells me ""I have told them 2 times to turn the music down and be quiet and they won't listen to me, why don't you call the police yourself"" I was floored by him saying this to me and told him it was NOT my job to enforce the rules, it was his. So he once again knocks on their door to tell them to turn the music down and be quiet. By now it's close to 1:00am in the morning and I am extremely tired and want to get to bed and sleep. What do they do? You guessed it... as soon as he is out of earshot they crank up the cRap music FULL volume and get very very loud. 

Now they know it is me calling the owner/manage on them and then proceed to get right outside my door and say hateful/racist comments they know I can hear. I hear them calling me a cracker, bitch, honkey, pasty white bitch and much more hateful things. **YES they're black people** making all the noise. Now I have had it and I am fed up with this childish behavior. So I call the **New York State Troopers** About 20 minutes later they show up and all hell breaks loose. The cops smell the marijuana and see the booze and see that the black people had NO less than 15 people in the room and that there were KIDS in the room, YES children, little kids... toddlers, 5, 7 years old and a new born baby. Next thing I hear is screaming and very very loud caterwauling like a wounded animal... seems the cops had to tase one of the black women for being uncooperative and not compliant with their requests when they were arresting and trying to handcuff her.

They arrested 9 of them and took the kids away ( I guess to CPS ) and remainder of them went back to their rooms or left. In the end the music ended and so did the bongo party. I finally got to sleep around 2:30am. BUT now I am the so-called BITCH and SNITCH of the homeless shelter motel and ignored and scorned by almost everyone except a few people that can't stand the nonsense, partying and drug use going on here like me. Yeah... there are a few other sane mature mentally stable adults here besides me here, but ONLY a few.

God I can't wait till I find a place of my own and am the hell out of this nightmare of a place.

81s8s5,0,MrsDomino2006,4,homeless,HomelessTN,"We are a family of 6. We live in Clarksville TN. We just need a place to rent to us. We only have $600 left out of $4000 because we bought a lemon truck for $1500 in Fairview TN and because we are a biracial married couple we were told by the cops that it is a civil suit. But if I sold a truck to someone with sawdust in the tranny I would be in jail. And the fact that my husband is black would just solidify their judgements of course. After having it towed back to Clarksville $300 later the money depleted from there. Kids are conditioned by the school system to eat 3 times a day. 4 kids ×2 is 8$. That's 3 times a day. So $30 a day on food. Plus the water in the hotel is brown so we spend about an extra 5$ on drinks every day. The hotel is $65-70$ everyday depending on who's working. We were going to pay by the week but when they found out how many kids we had they wanted a 500$ deposit which I refused. By now tho we've run through almost all of it. We've been here about 10 days now. Also paid someone $500 and come to find out It was a scam and the start of all of it came with Wal-Mart triple charging me on purchase I made with their green dot card. Tried to dispute it to no avail at this very moment. The shelters and organizations here can only help the same family so many times per regulations made by state officials and the program directors. So we've reached the limit. Tomorrow is the last day we will pay for this room. We've tried every family member we have and they just act like our funds are never ending and that because I am a woman I can get help. Neither of those assumptions are true. Only 3 of our kids go to school so if we were to get a job with the bus system here it would be impossible to not leave a 3 year old by themselves and if u start a job here in TN that pays anything well, you have to have open availability to even get hired. We have tried everything outside of resorting to drug dealing and prostitution. Which neither one of those will ever be done. We can't raise our kids that way. Any help is appreciated thx. Negative comments will be ignored. ",2018-03-03 12:11:43,2018,3,3,12,11,43

Long version: Throw away account here. My roommates are letting me go. They're moving into a new place and don't want me to tag along - only because I can't afford what they want me to pay for rent. I have a full time job, but it doesn't pay well and yes, I've been searching for years for a better job. No luck. I've got a college degree but no one wants me.

I have a really old, small car. I'm guessing I'm going to have to live in it. I've been homeless before for very short periods of times, but it mostly consisted of me crashing on friend's couches. My situation at the time was similar to this one currently - rent too high, don't make enough money, can't move. Now I don't have those couches to crash on anymore, I'm on my own. This really sucks for a girl, because even if I do find an affordable place, it's often marked down because the guy renting it wants to reduce your rent in exchange for having sex with him. You'd be surprised at how many people there are out there like that. 

So I need advice for living in my car. And maybe for acquiring some sort of housing that's affordable. I make less than $1200/month. Most shared bedrooms go for over that, not including utilities. By shared bedroom, I mean share with rapist/thief/etc. Before you call me a pessimist, I've been around the block a few times and have lived with every kind of character. Long story short, no stranger can be trusted. I've looked into my county's resources but everything is on a 10-year waiting list. What isn't I've applied for, and been rejected. I don't even need my own place, just a room, but you'd be surprised at the thousands of dollars per month that apparently costs, that I simply don't have. I can't move because then I'll be out of a job. I can't save because I'm paying off loans, gas/car repairs, and other expensive stuff. Essentially I'm stuck until I find a great deal in housing, which in the Bay Area, is impossible. 

I don't feel like I'm asking for a lot, to have a simple roof over my head that I'm willing to pay for. Apparently I am.",2017-08-30 22:35:44,2017,8,30,22,35,44
6u7beq,3,mackosher415,29,homeless,Question for the homeless,"As a native San Francisco we have lots of homelessness. I got a few question. I understand that life is hard on some people and I try to give the sympathy for the misfortunes of others. But with the rampant drug abuse and crime within the homeless community I find it hard to sympathize with them. I've been thinking, is there a line within this culture? How can we help people down on their luck? What about the true junkies that really are just scum of the earth? How do you deal with knowing some of you guys are good people while other are nasty human being?

6rixsz,2,directorw280,18,homeless,Freshly homeless but not helpless,"To start, I'm a military veteran. I never applied for my benefits. I'm also a convicted felon and a registered sex offender. If that last part offends you, stop reading and hit the back button.

Because I never applied for my benefits, I've never received any kind of disability benefits. So I'm up shit's creek in that regard. I'm also diagnosed ADHD and PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder). But it's been over 10 years since those diagnoses. As such, if I wanted any governmental assistance, I'd have to see a psychiatrist to qualify. 

Now that all that's out of the way, let's get to the meat of my issue. As I am a registered sex offender, my choice of housing can often become limited. Up until a week and a half ago, I was housed through a veteran's resource agency in a boarding house established for veterans. Due to favortism, the house manager was allowed to have his girlfriend live with him. His *pregnant* girlfriend. She gave birth and is living there with her child. I cannot live in the same house with children. I was forced to move everything I own into a storage unit, take 2 bags with only the absolutely necessary stuff to survive, and move into a shelter designated by Social Services. I have since been bounced from one shelter on a rotational basis.

I also have to go to an employability assessment interview to deem me eligible for work. 

I have Food Stamps and there are soup kitchens and food pantries nearby. My biggest worry is not having enough money for my storage unit. I have friends helping me. I honestly don't want to let my family know I'm homeless. I feel like it would diminish my self-worth in their eyes. I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have been attacked twice for my crimes. The first time I was choked out and the second time I had the shit beat out of me. I had contusions on my head and abrasions on my whole left side of my body. 

I just needed to let someone know. I feel like the world is on top of me but I refuse to let it get me down.",2017-08-04 01:31:59,2017,8,4,1,31,59

In graduate school, I was an outstanding student but found myself wanting more in life, which education wasn't providing. Part of me sees advancing an education level as futile and ultimately arbitrary.

Now, after graduating, I am tempted to try out an ""alternative"" lifestyle: namely, homelessness. Several years ago I was bitten by the travel bug and have since become fascinated by a multitude of vloggers and books that capture the magic of a vagabond, or homeless, lifestyle. I enjoy adventure and can be tremendously low-maintenance if I want so the obvious challenges of becoming homeless, though daunting to some, are not particularly intimidating to me.

My question for you, reddit, is, is homeless lifestyle for me? Should I finally abandon my formal education (a doctorate degree is as high as I can get anyway) and instead focus on learning or ""developing"" in a nomadic setting?

60pznp,0,Mr_Home_Less,7,homeless,An Odd Thing To See In A Homeless Shelter,"Right, so I haven't posted in a while.  Evidently, when one person get's sick in a homeless shelter, EVERYBODY gets sick in the homeless shelter.  Medicaid must love us.

I'm sitting here at the library, thinking of a topic to write about, and across from me, I have a woman sitting across from me, whose gender is questionable, even WITH all of the makeup on, and an older homeless gentleman whom I recognize.  It must, however, be noted, that the guy I recognize, looks suspiciously like Saddam Hussein, and is randomly hitting the keyboard, while looking perplexed at the screen.  Yay for ""homeless internet"", keeping library security guards on a power trip busy since... 10:00 A.M.

So, yes, we all got sick.  Like, you know, cold, can't breathe, coughing into the stagnant, unfiltered, and uncirculating atmosphere, we call ""home""  Sick as in, we all touched the same door handles, toilet knobs, bars of soap and WHATEVER in the heck else we all touched together.  Nastiness.  Thanks government healthcare!

On to the topic.

Men who dress like women:

So, one of the biggest surprises that I got when I first checked into the homeless shelter, was seeing women there.  I was taken aback.  Again, not much can surprise me anymore.  Come to find out, these weren't really women...  they were men...

These men had evidently been taking female hormones and growing breasts.  Not just that, some also had silicone bra inserts...  Ok, so guys growing breasts, not... too...crazy... right?!  They also dressed in women's clothes, had long hair, and they all wore makeup!  *MIND BLOWN  Seriously?!  Yep!  Seriously!

Again, I'm not one to judge.  If this is your thing and what makes you feel like a complete person, have at it.  Have fun.  AAAAAAAAND they did...  They had fun with a number of the guys in there(if you know what I mean)

I recently got assigned the ""Crew Lead"" of my ""job"" at the shelter.  My ""job"" consists of going to the other shelter(my original shelter) and removing all of the blankets from the 300ish bunks.  The shelter I have to go to for work, is the more rough shelter, and has all of the transient homeless fellows.  Cool.  Give me gloves and a biological HAZMAT suit.  I'll be good.

You think I joke.  I've found every bodily fluid known to mankind over there, along with AIDS medication.  Some of it on the same bunk...  Crazy.  HAZMAT suit isn't so crazy of an idea now, is it?!

We lovingly call one of the guys who dress like girls(from here on out, known as GWDLG) as Mr. Burns.  You know, from The Simpsons.  The big nose, the bald head with the long blonde hair in the back, and MASSIVE overbite...  He prefers the gel bra inserts.  How do I know?  He gave them to one of the guys to play with one day...

They don't hide it, that's the thing.  What MAY get me the most, is that at shower time, in the evening, the 7-10 of them(it varies from night to night, but the staples are always there), get the entire shower room to themselves.  Look, I dont want to see that sort of thing, but when 500 other guys have to wait for them to get done, and use the same 6 showers, it starts to aggravate us.

Luckily nowadays, I only have to see them in the mornings.  No GWDLG are at my current shelter.

I don't know if I'll ever get over the sight of a woman using a urinal...

PS.  The woman sitting across from me was actually a guy...",2017-03-21 14:11:53,2017,3,21,14,11,53

To be homeless is to have no fixed address, which means you can’t borrow books from a public library — but it doesn’t mean you’ve no desire to read.
 
The idea: 
1. You finish a book
2. We will send you a small card to stick onto the front of your book, it will say that it is a 500pagesofhumanity book and explain what that means. 
3. You write your name in the book 
4. Give your book to a homeless person you see sleeping rough 
5. After they have read the book, they will write their name under yours and pass the book on to another rough sleeper of friend. 
6. This will continue, and continue, and continue...
 
Why?
Reading allows us to escape the monotony of everyday life, it allows us to dream and live in worlds beyond our own imaginations. This is not, and should not be the privilege of those better off, it must be shared and equally enjoyed by all. I think that 'paying a book forward' could be a way of achieving that. 
 
But I can't do it without your help... 
 
Your donations will help us to kickstart this project and get the first set of cards printed and the first 500 books out to homeless men and women living on the street in London. ",2017-01-08 15:12:02,2017,1,8,15,12,2

This ""homeless"" old guy comes up wearing a 400 dollar parka and waving a starbucks cup saying ""excuse me guys, can you please give me a dollar?"" My friend doesn't even give him the decency of even looking at the guy, while I say ""Sorry bro, I don't."" He then says that God has a special place in hell for liars, and I respond with ""Oh yeah? I guess I'm not going there then."" The guy looks at me in disbelief for a second, then leaves when he sees two cops coming towards him. This isn't even the first time this has happened. Every single time I have an encounter with a homeless person, they are always DEMANDING money from me, even when I obviously don't have a lot to give (I'm a young-looking high-school student and I don't even have a job).

So anyway buddy, I do have money. Just none for you.

P.S. How would I be able to tell real homeless from fake homeless people? I live in NYC, where homeless people are seen as less than dirt. I want to help real people in need, but when there's countless gypsies waving their kid around and begging for money while their SUV is parked around the corner, I don't even want to give these people the satisfaction of even talking to them.

I've had enough of my current life!

I've had enough not having enough money and having to sell my stuff! I've had enough about worrying when the landlord is going to cash the check I sent while trying to stuff my bank account! All that rent money could go into my pockets to advance my life's goals but instead it's going to an roach filled apartment full of junk!

Well that's it! I'm selling everything I got, keeping the cash, and becoming homeless. This isn't on a whim either. I've been thinking about this for a long time and only now I realize this was really all planning. I've been plotting out how to survive in the streets while working on my goals in life. I want to get rid of it all to gain it all but I'm going to need more time dedicated to it and some extra cash wouldn't hurt.

Am I crazy? I guess I am but sometimes you gotta do something bold and daring to reach your goals.

For now I'm preparing myself by selling all my stuff and I'll also have to tell my family about it (mostly lie to them, I doubt they'll approve of this) but it's finally happening.

4kxbip,2,imtiredoffighting,10,homeless,I Want To Be An Actor,"I'm 22. I graduated high school in 2011. I currently help run a shoe store as an assistant manager in a city in Michigan. For years my mother and I have grown increasingly distant personalities. I want to be left alone a lot. I want quiet spaces. My mother wants more from everyone. She expects things to be perfect. Last Thursday I was preparing for the first vacation I've ever taken. I was stressed. And when she picked at me and shouted, I shouted back. She left for church, and I felt awful, but I packed my things for the weekend.

I got back Monday Night and was informed that I am leaving. Their home isn't mine anymore. And I have to leave. Originally, my mother wanted this coming weekend. My dad argued against it. But I'm still being forced to go.

I have a shiba inu that I love dearly. I got him from a rescue organization. He loves me more than I deserve.

I work at the shoe store now because I made friends with the current manager, who is part of my gaming group. He got engaged recently. But I want to do art and writing and when you have no time for art and when you don't have a degree to help put your foot in the door for writing, no one wants to take time for you unless you possess an extraordinary talent. I don't. My talent is that I'm a good actor. Which, living in Michigan, is impossible.

I don't have a car. When I was younger I took driver's ed and passed, but when I went to take the second course, they denied me. See, I was born in Germany, on a US Military Base. We had a copy of a proof of birth abroad form that my Dad was able to use in lieu of a birth certificate for the first course of driver's ed, but they wouldn't let him use it the second time. We got my permit years later after I turned 18, when I was 20. But he works so much that he never had time to teach me enough to learn how to drive on my own. So my permit expired. And I need to get a new one, and I need to get a car, and I need to learn how to drive. All before I go. Riddle me this, man. If he didn't have time for me in two years, how would he ever have time for me in the next week?

Something is wrong in my head. I was taking a course in Medical Coding and Billing, but I stopped, and later on I tried again and paid another fee, but stopped. I was so tired all the time working at a movie theater that I just couldn't ever focus. I lied to my parents, then. And I think this is why I'm having to leave, this is why I should leave. I lied to them about finishing.

Acting gives me clarity and peace of mind. I don't have to be me when I'm acting. I don't like being me.

In a little under two weeks (I'm guessing) I'm going to be homeless. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to get by. Everyone I could ask for help has a cat, which I'm allergic to.

I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of trying and failing. I'm tired of being a failure. I don't want things to go this way, but riddle me this, man. I've had 22 years to get my shit together, or even to ask for help, and I just haven't. What're the odds of me doing it in two weeks?

I turn 23 next month. Second Saturday of the month. Same birthday as Peter Dinklage, Hugh Laurie and Shia LaBeouf. I always joke that, when I made it and became famous, I'd post up on Twitter asking if they wanted any Birthday Cake. People laughed.

I have no money save for my paycheck next Friday. That isn't enough for a car. Or an apartment. Or much of anything. I don't have anyone to help me out.

I'm posting this up because I'm scared. And I'm refusing to get angry, because then I'd be like my Mother. I'm posting this up because I am not right in the head. I'm posting this up because I'm just a kid and going to face the real world soon. I'm posting this up because I'm struggling between continuing to chase down my dream and get back on my feat and be bigger than anyone I've ever known has been... or giving in to the soothing voices in my head.

And I'm posting this up because to a lot of people I'm a good guy. They've told me. A good friend. A great person to work with. I can make people smile or laugh when I want them to. And when I say this, you should think. How many people do you know are like this? How many people do you know for certain aren't messed up and just very good at acting like it doesn't hit them?

Honestly though? I feel like I should just by a ticket to NYC, and see what happens.

tl;dr I deserve it.",2016-05-24 19:44:40,2016,5,24,19,44,40

45z3do,9,flipstables,16,homeless,I bought a homeless person lunch today and I feel awful,"I was at Jack in the Box for lunch today getting a free sandwich from a coupon.  As I finished up, a girl came up to me and asked me to buy her some food.  I assumed she was homeless since she was asking for assistance.  I bought her about $10 worth of fast food and left.  And now I feel awful.

I don't know what the right answer is when giving assistance to the homeless.  People have told me that they'll just use it for drugs.  Or that I'm just enabling them.  Businesses told me not to give to them because it just trains them to come back, which will drive away customers.  But I'm faced with the fact that a human being who is probably hungry without means to buy herself food is asking for my help.

Whenever a homeless person asks me for assistance, I think about it for days.  Lots of questions roll around in my mind.  How do we help these people?  Give them all housing?  Let them all starve?  Jail them?  Provide shelters?  What's the solution? Why are people homeless in the first place?  Mental health issues?  Drugs?  Outcast members of society?  Laziness?  Down on their luck?  Stupidity?  Something else?  Does it even matter why people are homeless if we are unwilling to do anything about it?

Whenever I give or not give something to the homeless, I never feel good about it.  I just feel angry and sad.  I fucking hate that these people even *need* to ask for my help. I'm angry at the homeless people themselves--that they let their lives get this way as if all of them had a choice in the matter.  I'm angry at my government for not being able to help as if I'm giving them the tax dollars and resources to find silver bullet solution.  I'm angry at myself for not even wanting to help beyond this girl asking me for some food.

And here's the perverse thing on my part.  I really have no interest in being part of the solution.  Really, I don't give a shit about these people.  I have my own problems, and I'm motivated by my own greed and laziness.  I want someone else to solve the problem for me.  Not because I care deeply for these people.  But so I can sleep better at night.

I don't know why I'm writing all this down.  I think it's because I don't know what to do.  I want these people to get help, but I don't want to do anything about it.",2016-02-15 15:16:11,2016,2,15,15,16,11

3sco9i,1,homelessfroaway,16,homeless,A question - what to say to people who beg,"Dear r/homeless

I live in an area of socal that well, if I go to the target one street over, its all affluent people and there are no homeless on the premesis, if I got to the one 3 streets over, its the exact opposite. Today a woman was chasing me down as I head out the store, yelling to get my attention. I thought maybe I had forgotten something. But no, this is what she said: 

Excuse me miss, I have this nice korean girl right here and I've asked her for help with some money to get a hotel tonight. You see I'm homeless. I'm asking people of all different races because the black people here aren't helping me. 

I told her I wasn't in a place financially to get her a hotel room. Which is true. Just because I'm white, maybe she saw that I spent a chunk of money at target, doesn't mean I can help you. I think she was trying not to be racist, but she was. 

Very frequently if someone asks for some change, I give them a few dollars. Or if someone is on the side of the road, i'll give them some of my taco bell. I also donate to my church which has its own welfare system, so I contribute in these ways. But I find myself in these situations very frequently because of where I live. 

tldr: As someone who is not homeless, what can I tell people when I really can't help them? Do you beg? Why? I want to point people in the direction of a shelter or job opportunities, but I figure if they are homeless they have tried those already. ",2015-11-10 18:24:43,2015,11,10,18,24,43

3kkogw,2,KeiroD,0,homeless,"Soon to be Homeless, need help","Hi!

I'll be cross-posting this post to /r/Oregon shortly.

Basically, so far no one is willing or able to help me. My family members in the area have so far not responded on Facebook. I am supposed to be out of here by Sunday.

My friend has more time but she's still being evicted.

We DO have a place to go, but we need to wait until our friend from Tennessee shows up to take us back over there.

Summary of situation:

https://pastebin.com/SKFgSxc6.

Text of link is reproduced below:

Family and friends... Let me know where you are, as I am in need of emergency help.

Basically, the apartment complex here is being a dick and have decided to boot myself and my friend out. They indicated that I wasn't supposed to be here for more than three days. Another apartment complex informed us that what this apartment complex is pulling is illegal and that I have 7 days before I need to go.

Wanna know what's even more FUN?!

I had handed in my application two hours prior to the eviction notice being posted yesterday. I myself need to go today, based on what this apartment complex said while my friend needs to find a place in 30 days. If you're able to help me out, let me know ASAP.

As for where I am, I am in Pendleton, Oregon.

EDIT: Just learned the real reason of the eviction process... apparently it's due to my bad credit!

WTF. That's some serious fucked up logic.
 
Keiro Dreamwalker I will be out and about to try finding housing in the area. As such, please text me at 541-240-9328 if you are able to help.
 
The apartment complex basically said fuck you to us. That is all I know, regarding me applying for a place here.

Second Pastebin of talking with a friend of mine about our situation, though he is not a lawyer:

https://pastebin.com/TP96WqTB

Text reproduced below from the pastebin.

Friend: So what's the deal?  I thought you were good to go for the move up here?

Me:I was. At least, until the apartment complex decided to pull dick moves.

Friend: What happened?  I could barely make heads or tales of what Nikki left on voicemail.  I had to have [wife] listen to it twice.

Me: Ah. Basically, the apartment complex decided to post a 24-hr eviction notice because I had been here for more than 3 days... but another apartment complex said that was illegal and that I could stay for 7 days. They're still evicting her in 30 days though, just because I was here.

Friend: Why didn't they ask for you to be added to the lease?

Me: Even though I'd applied to be her housemate two hours prior. And they'd declined to add me to the lease because of bad credit.

Friend: Oh crap
Me: Yup. The thing I don't get is... Why decline me for an existing place? She had a good record of paying rent on time, etc. There was ZERO reason to. Even with my bad credit, because I have a guaranteed source of income.

Friend: I dunno dude, the place here just got bought by new landlord (first time ones at that) and I had to ask for a lease ammendment for my kids visitation.  Some are super strict, some not so much.

Me: Apparently we got unlucky in that aspect. It's bullshit, either way.

Friend: Indeed.

Me: Also, I'm pretty sure I have standing to sue because of this: https://www.osbar.org/public/legalinfo/1248_HousingDiscrimination.htm
Illegal Housing Discrimination But of course, time is working against us, so...

Friend: Yes you could based on disability discrimination.  The hard part is proving that it is due to your disability alone, and not other criteria.  Now, with that being said, it is reasonable to presume that if you raise that in court that they would have to prove that the decision is not based on that in some form or fashion.  We have a similar case here with Dawnell's mom where they have been trying to evict her from day 1, and she is partially wheelchair bound, and they are cciting a lease violation because we hadn'tt added the two people staying with her as live in care givers as fast as they would like.

Me: -nods- So probably fairly likely that we can make it work.

Friend: The key is do they do that with *all* tenants, and can they prove it?

Me: Don't know. Probably not, but... don't know.

Friend: I would also approach it from a race stand point.  Dawnell was saying that eastern oregon has a lot of racists, and since you have that strong hispanic look, she said that they probably saw you, saw your disability and decided they didn't liek you based on that.  Having done background checks for the federal govt up at the VA, I can say that it takes approx 72 hours at the least upwards of a week to get credit and background checks back.

Me: ... Hmm. And yet, they did it in less than 24 hours. ... Yes, I think we can go with this route.

Friend: Wait a sec, did the sheriff serve the 30 day notice?

Me: No. The notice was served by the manager, not by the sheriff. At least, the 24-hr notice one. The 30 day notice one, I assume was also made by the same managers.

Friend: Right the 24 hour notice is served by management, as is a 30 day notice to vacate.  Now was she in a one year lease or month to month? If she's been there at least a year, it has to be a minimum of 60 days notice per Oregon law Also, if it is a one year lease, they have to list a cause.  If it's month to month, it's considered at-will and they can do a no cause eviction.

Me: One year. The one year lease expired. When, though, not sure.

Friend: Shit, that means it reverted to a month to month.  Still a 60 day notice applies.

Me: Let me verify with her, though.

Friend: ok, I need to look it up real quick.  Been about 4-5 years since i took business law

Me: Alrighty.

Friend: https://www.osbar.org/public/legalinfo/1253_ResidentialEvictionNotices.htm Anything over a year has to be 60 days notice, and although they do not have to list a reason, it can not be given for anything illegal such as racial and disability in your case.  Since you applied, and they retaliated, I'm not a lawyer by any means, but I think she may be able to beat it based on that.

Me: Yep.

Friend: If it were me, I would start looking for a place ASAP, and ride out the process.  She may want to point out to them that since she has been there over a year, they are required to give a 60 day notice.  Technically, they could try to counter with a 72 hour notice to vacate, but since they already posted the 30 day notice, I don't think it would hold.  Keep everything!!!  Also, make notes of dates, times, what was said, who said it, etc.  Any further contact, note it down. The bad thing about these things is that even if she beats it, they will most likely try and find a different reason to get her out, and you out as well.

Me: We already are.",2015-09-11 12:35:43,2015,9,11,12,35,43

3gv1w7,0,rabb1tdotcom,9,homeless,Desperate need :(,"Someone posted here on my behalf about 3-4 months ago, and someone suggested I post again since help has pretty much stopped elsewhere.

I'm not really sure what to say, other than I'm in desperate need of help. :( I'm in my 8th year of being homeless, and for most of that I was 'balanced' in that I had a part time job which covered basic expenses, and had enough to put away a little for emergencies (which seemed to always happen every other year, draining me back down to zero savings again.)

A little over a year ago the City of Mountain View recreation department, where I'd been working for 6 years to that point, decided to fire me with no warning, without reason or justification, and gave me no severance pay. Unemployment was approved, but ran out in about the middle of January. Since then I've been eeking by on what was left, as well as donations from people through my site. But lately those have stopped. :(

I don't know where to turn anymore and I'm on the verge of not having enough gas to keep my car going. It's going to hit the red warning light either tomorrow or the next day, and once it does and it's not being moved it would only be a matter of days before it was towed. (I'm in a pretty high density area, so there's a lot of people watching out for 'abandoned cars'.) I can try and extend that by walking to the places I need to go, but with flat feet and extremely bad ankles, walking more than a few hundred feet can cause pain and swelling that basically has the same impact as a bad sprain or break, so walking is a terrible idea for me. :(

Please consider sending even a small donation to help. :( And if you can, help pass on the word.

To tell you a bit about who you'd be helping...

- I have an associates and bachelors in Psychology. I previously worked in graphic arts for 5 years, general office work for 5, and as above, until recently worked as a 'facility manager' (unlocking and locking doors) for 6 years.

- I'm currently doing part time classes when I can in film because I have a podcast and am pretty good at editing and doing sound work adjustments.

- I've gotten pretty close with my favorite professor at school, and I'm her favorite TA. (Unfortunately only one professor gets paid TAs in the department, and it's not her. :( ) I help out with two of her classes each quarter, helping the students understand Adobe Premiere and Avid Media Composer, and just generally help them make their things more awesome.

- I'm a pretty hardcore gamer, and was awarded the 1st forum MVP status by Blizzard for helping in the Hearthstone forums. I still help there a bit every day, and in the less than 2 years since launch I'm at almost 15,000 posts.

- I have a website where I talk about PC gaming hardware and recommend builds, which I've run for quite some time.

I've been writing about my terrible journey ever since the start. Sadly because it's gone on so long it's become a fairly repetitive daily journal and much less of the philosophical journey it started out as. But if you want to peek at it, here is the most recent post...

Donations are super appreciated and you can find a donation link at any of the pages of Epic Fail, at the top of the podcast page, and on my bio page. Gas is the extreme critical need for the moment, and with only needing $10 a week to keep moving I've always been hopeful I could find enough kind people out there to help me out until I can get back on my feet on my own. :( :)

3f682t,4,morxy49,33,homeless,I want to be homeless.,"First of all, I don't mean to offend anyone with this post. I understand being homeless is very hard for most homeless people, and I respect that. This is mostly a dream of mine, and I'm very sure it isn't this great when you are actually homeless yourself.

With that said, I often have these thoughts about being homeless, how nice it would be, and what I could do.
I recently backpacked trough Europe with my two buddies for three weeks, and the feeling of just having yourself, your backpack and your friends, being able to go anywhere you want with no restrictions was amazing.
This is where I started to realize the beauty of being homeless. You have very little to worry about except your own well-being.
Now that I'm home again I have to worry about so many thing just to keep a living standard.
I hate doing the same thing every day - going to work/school just to be able to pay the bills for my expensive, tiny apartment I don't even want to live in.
I also hate sitting at home everyday just staring at the computer. This, of course, I could change today if I wanted to, but it's just not the same.
I also think it is a very unique thing to have in your life. It's really an experience and something to talk about.

A would-be disciple of Jesus once asked him if he could follow him wherever he went. Jesus answered him by saying ‘The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.’ (Matthew 8:20)

Jesus wasn’t the first homeless person and he certainly won’t be the last but maybe he was the most famous homeless person in history. When he was born Mary and Joseph were travelling to Bethlehem to take part in a Roman census. Because of the huge numbers there they could find no accommodation and had to spend the night in a stable which is where he was born. The last three years of his life were spent in itinerant ministry. He began and ended his life as a homeless person. Now just imagine if he came to Harrogate.

Here is a man of average height with Middle-eastern features, long hair and a beard. He is wearing a long white robe and sandals. He is standing in the middle of Harrogate near the Cenotaph. He looks around and sees Bettys but he has no money. He turns around and sees St. Peter’s and walks towards it. Inside he notices that several people are having breakfast. He walks towards one of the servers. ‘Hannah’, he says, ‘I would love a cup of tea.’ ‘How do you know my name?’ she replies. ‘I know everything.’ ‘In that case you should know to go to the counter first’ she said smiling. He does so and asks Richard for a cup of tea. She follows him and asks for his name. ‘Jesus’, he replies. ‘You’re not a friend of Rudy, are you?’ ‘I know him but I would not say we are friends.’ ‘Where are you staying?’ she asks. ‘Nowhere’, he replies. ‘I’ll get in touch with the Harrogate Homeless Project and they’ll soon fix you up.’ She rings up Andy Kirk and arranges an appointment for later that day.

‘Did you want breakfast?’ Hannah asks him. ‘I ate before I came here’, he says. After finishing his tea Jesus leaves the church and wanders around Harrogate. He sees some homeless people sleeping outside the Halifax Building Society and approaches them. ‘Would you like to stay at my place?’ ‘Where’s that, then’, one of them responds. ‘Heaven’, Jesus says. ‘How do I get there?’ ‘By believing in me’, Jesus replies. ‘Well I don’t, so push off.’ ‘Hang on’ says one of the others. ‘I’m tired of this kind of life. I’d do anything to change this way of life. What do I have to do?’ ‘Take up your cross and follow me. By the cross I mean give up drugs, tobacco and drink. Be kind to others and you will soon be in heaven because you have not long for this life.’ ‘What do you mean, not long to live! I’m as fit as a fiddle, apart from a few aches and pains and a bit of a cough.’ ‘That’s just the start of the beginning of the end. You need to put your house in order.’ ‘Tell me what I have to do.’ ‘Follow me, Tom.’

They went across the road to Springboard and rang the bell. Derek opened the door and both entered. ‘What’s your name?’  he asked Jesus. ‘Jesus Christ.’ ‘You’re lying’, said Derek. ‘No I’m not’, replied Jesus. ‘Ask Kerry. She’s one of my followers.’ Derek went off to fetch Kerry. He brought her back and told her, ‘He says he’s Jesus and you’re one of his followers.’ Kerry looked him up and down and said, ‘Show me your hands.’ Jesus did so and Kerry gulped and then asked him, ‘When did I become your follower?’ ‘At the age of thirteen when you were at Bible camp.’ Kerry sank to the floor and whispered, ‘My Lord and my God.’ ‘Yes’, replied Jesus, ‘now rise. You have a lot of lunches to prepare.’ ‘I’d rather stay here and be like Mary’, replied Kerry. ‘Later’, said Jesus, ‘for the moment I want you to be like Martha.’

Later, Jesus and Tom went to the hostel in Bower Street. ‘Wait outside for me here. I won’t be long.’ ‘Right’ said Tom. Jesus pressed the bell. A voice rang out of the intercom and asked ‘Who is it?’ ‘I have an appointment with Andy Kirk’, said Jesus. A moment later the door opened and Jesus entered. ‘Come this way’, the young girl said. Jesus followed her into reception and through a door and down the hall. She opened a door and said, ‘Go right in.’ Jesus did so and there was a tall man in his thirties sitting at a desk. ‘Do sit down’, he said. ‘Hannah said you were homeless.’ ‘Well, I have no abode on earth’, said Jesus. ‘I need to take a few particulars. First your full name’. ‘Jesus Christ.’ ‘I see. And your date of birth?’ ‘Most people reckon it’s the 25th of December in the year 1’, replied Jesus. ‘Telephone number?’ ‘Jeremiah 33:3’ (call unto me and I will answer you) ‘Where were you born?’ ‘Israel.’ ‘How did you arrive in England? By boat or train?’ ‘By air.’ ‘Have you ever been in England before?’ asked Andy. ‘Well, there’s a famous hymn that goes:
	And did those feet in ancient time
	Walk upon England’s mountains green:
	And was the holy Lamb of God,
	On England’s pleasant pasture’s seen!
I would hate to ruin a good hymn!’

‘I see’, said Andy. ‘I need to find out if you have any local connections. Do you have any relatives in Harrogate?’ ‘I have thousands of children here’. ‘Biological?’ ‘No, spiritual’, said Jesus. ‘I’m afraid that does not count as a local connection so I’m afraid we can’t help you.’ ‘Have you no place for me here?’ ‘No, but we can give you a sleeping bag.’ Jesus took it and left the building. ‘Any luck?’ asked Tom. ‘No place for me in the hostel’, said Jesus. ‘Nothing new there, then’ said Tom.

‘Let’s go back to the Halifax, Tom. We’ll spend the night there.’ ‘Ok’, said Tom. Off they went and soon arrived there, setting out their sleeping bags side by side. As it was a bit cold they got into them. After a while Jesus said, ‘I think it’s time to go home, Tom. Do you still believe in me?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Hold my hand and today you will be with me in Paradise.’ Tom reached out his hand and took Jesus’ in his own. A moment later Jesus vanished and Tom’s lifeless hand fell to the ground. Where Jesus had lain in the sleeping bag there was just a faint outline of a human body. Tom’s body started to go cold.

It was only the next day when his body was discovered. A week later St. Peter’s was packed for the funeral. After the hymn Abide with me the Reverend Tony Shepherd began his address. He spoke about Tom’s childhood, the abuse and the descent into drug hell. Then he spoke about the change in Tom’s life when he met Jesus. He then pointed to the coffin and said, ‘Tom is not here. He is risen!’ There was not a dry eye to be found in the church. Everyone was looking up. Not at the church roof but far beyond that. They all knew where Tom was now. And strangely, for a funeral, everyone was smiling.

32pwi7,2,TheFatterBatman,9,homeless,HOMELESS SHELTER...Hopefully Coming Soon!,"I have come to the conclusion there are too many homeless people with nowhere to go (came to that conclusion YEARS ago) and I am going to try to do something about it.  The number of homeless people far outweigh the number of homeless shelters in any given area in the country.

This is where it is in my head:I want to (this is obvious) find a building such as an old hospital or hotel (something that has multiple rooms)...if that's not available, then just something big enough to PUT rooms in.  I'm thinking 2-4 people per room.  It would also require at least 3-4 half baths (toilet, shower, sink).  Also, it would require AT LEAST one on-site washer and dryer.

At the shelter there would be 3 meals a day (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).  However, unlike most of the shelters around the country, people would not be required to attend a religious service in order to get their meal.  It's pointless.  Yes, there are religious people who are homeless, but there are also those who are Atheists or don't have the same religious background as others (making a service only useful to a select few people in the shelter). 

Also, unlike the more religious-based shelters, because it is being ran in a non-religious affiliated way, there would be no discrimination against people from any background regardless of sex, race, age or sexual orientation.

""Tenants"" would be allowed to stay for up to 60 days giving them time to find a job and figure out how much their monthly income would be in order to find housing of their own within their monthly price range.  They would need to find a job within 1-2 weeks.  If they have a problem with saving money, they can give it to one of the staff members to hold on to while they reside at the shelter there in a box that is specifically for them if they so desire.

There would be a nightly curfew of 10pm (unless your job requires you to be gone later than that).  Since room at the shelter is limited, the curfew is enforced otherwise because there are plenty of other people out there who need a place to stay at night other than on the streets.

With the help of local food pantries and clothing stores (such as Goodwill, Salvation Army Thrift Store, etc) we would be able to help the tenants to succeed by making sure they have food in their stomachs and clothing on their backs.  I mean, honestly, who's going to hire someone who has ripped, dirty clothes on?

DRUGS AND ALCOHOL ARE A NO-NO!  This will get people removed from the shelter!  If you come to the shelter and have been drinking, you will be turned away even if you are already registered at the shelter!  If you are registered at the shelter and are ""high"" on drugs, you will be turned away and asked to leave the property permanently.  However, if you are a drug addict and want to get clean, as long as you continue NOT to use, you may stay at the shelter and be given information as to how to get help for your addiction (such as NA or AA for those who have a drinking problem).

This will be a non-profit shelter, so all income is donation based and all staff will be volunteer workers.",2015-04-15 13:32:27,2015,4,15,13,32,27

2rod2m,5,KillerWale,17,homeless,My homeless story,"Last spring my parents gave me an ultimatum and a choice to either go to inpatient rehab for marijuana addiction or homelessness. I chose to be homeless. I really didn't like that they were trying to force me to go to an inpatient 12 step program for marijuana which I wasn't about to abstain from. I knew once in the system they would just keep sending me back because I had no plans on quitting smoking.

Lucky I had a friend who was willing to take me in and we ended up fixing and selling mobile phone as a business. That lasted for a few months and saved up some money and bought a car and decided to relocate to California. We were planning on selling the car once we got to California but he had other plans and secretly went behind my back and made arrangements to fly back to Minnesota once the car was sold. I doubt that his parents would let me live with them if I returned because they were against us leaving in the first place. So I ditched him and took the car. I knew he would be OK because he made friends with this homeless guy from LA and stopped focusing on work and starting spending most of their time playing computer games together. 

After that I got a job as a dishwasher/delivery boy and have been saving up $750 every two weeks. I could easily afford an apartment but living in my car wasn't as terrible as i thought it would be and I wanted to save my money instead of giving half away every month to a land lord. I got the idea that I would build up a proper bank roll and give poker a shot. 

In California the gambling age is 21 so I made plans to fly to Florida on January 24th. By then I'll have $8000 saved up. I've played poker back in Minnesota and was a winning player over a smallish sample size of 100 hours winning over $2000 at the casino and I was the best poker player out or my 12 or so friends that I played home games with starting when I was 15. So I'm confident that I can beat the lower limits NLHE games easy at any casino.

But I have some apprehensions about moving to another state all by myself. First for the last 3 weeks I've been trying to find housing in Florida. It's been a lot harder than I thought it would be. I've got a $600 monthly budget but when ever I find something that looks promising people don't want to take a risk on some guy from out of state or they don't want to reserve it for me. I had one promising arrangement for bunk mates for $360 a month but they wanted me to send $250 security deposit as a money order with out any sort of rental agreement and I decided I didn't want to risk it.

I'm feeling the pressure now and it's starting to stress me out. I need to sell my car. I need to get ride of most my stuff. I need to buy a cell phone. I need to figure out how I'm going to get to the airport. I need to find a place to live. I really want to move on with my life and start making a name for my self. 

I could really could use a joint right now but my car radiator is leaking badly and I can't risk the 45 minute drive to Berkeley so I can buy some weed at People's Park. I haven't smoked weed for 3 months now the longest I've gone since I was 14. I really miss smoking but my desire to be successful is stronger than my desire to smoke. 

I can't wait for the day when I'm living in LA playing 5-10 at the casino with a medical marijuana card 100,000 in my bank account and flexing my success all over Facebook for my friends and family to see that I don't need them I did this all on my own. That's 2-3 years away and it's not going to be an easy road. One way or another I'll make it then I'll focus on being an entrepreneur and start gunning for a billion. 

Realisticly this is probably about 1 in a million but I'm still gonna try. Worst case scenario I'll get a couple of good stories out of it then I'll go back to college and find another way to build myself up. But I will never abstain from marijuana I might takes breaks from it now and then but that will be my own choice. I'm the master of my own existence the second you give that up you become a slave. 

Peace,

2o9v4m,7,Rweakins,11,homeless,If the National Debt could be used to support the homeless....,"In honor of the national debt reaching $18T I began thinking of things that could be done with **$18,000,000,000,000**.  I got to thinking how many homeless people could be taken care of and had some spare time so I worked this up.  Keep in mind $18T is a lot of freaking money, and it took me several iterations to come up with how I could spend all this money on things that were either a necessity or a mild luxury.  This is what I found that you could provide the homeless with using $18T.



-*A home*.  Not only a home, but a home valued at $1,000,000

-*Power and water* for that home for 30 years.  Not only power and water for 30 years but power and water at a usage level 3x greater than the national average

-*A car*.  Not just any car, but a Nissan GT-R (MSRP $101,700).  And not just one, but one every 10 years for the next 30 years
-Premium gas for those nice cars.  Enough for 25k miles a year for 30 years.

-New *iPhones*.  Not only new iPhones but the top tier model (paying the $949 full retail price) every year for 30 years, with $100/mo each month for 30 years for service.



The other part that I forgot to mention is that after I did all these calculations I had a little left over.  **Enough to provide this same luxury package to the homeless in the other 24 of the top 25 most populated countries in the world!**

Since I know some people will be wondering how all this was calculated I will just drop a little of my methodology below:

1.  Inflation was not used in these calculations
2.  I searched for the number of homeless people in the US, calculated what percentage of the total population that was, and then applied the same percentage to the other 24 countries used.  Obviously this isn't 100% accurate but for the sake of brevity I used it as an assumption for my purposes
3.  I calculated the cost per person in the US, used the percentage of population calculation from step 2 to calculate the number of homeless people for each country, multiplied to two and got how much each country would receive.
4.  I sadly did not save my spreadsheet so don't ask to see it, although I'm sure I could recreate it at some point if the demand were there.  
5.  I used Google mostly to search for values and average spending

2h0pz4,1416,NonaSuomi282,366,homeless,A warning for any young persons in the Las Vegas area,"I'm sure those who live in or near Vegas already know it's not a nice place to be on the streets, but after a few years looking back, I realize I need to offer a warning to anyone in the area about a particular organization/shelter that I ran across. HELP of Southern Nevada operates a shelter for individuals aged 16-24 on LVBD just north of the freeway called the Shannon West Homeless Youth Center. It is a small compound consisting of a decommissioned motel and the adjacent administration building, as well as the fenced grounds around it, located on the southeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Foremaster.

Now admittedly I have not been in many shelters, but this place is one to avoid by my reckoning. They do offer long-term residency, but at the cost of being effectively jailed to it and treated as a criminal. They advertise themselves with promises such as substance abuse counselling, mental health referrals, anger management. In practice, this takes the form of  a regimental schedule from before dawn until you are allowed into your room at night to sleep, and twice-daily mandatory ""group therapy"" sessions where no licensed therapist or psychologist ever makes an appearance and which are often specifically read from the Bible. These sessions were all very specifically aimed at self-flagellation, intended to get you to admit some wrongdoing that was topical to the discussion of the day and publicly shame yourself for it. There was also a large and pointed focus on hard drug abuse and felony-criminal offenses; refusal to admit to anything severe enough to satisfy the minister who drove in each day for these sessions would result in being called out and accosted , fire-and-brimstone style, for most of the remainder of the session.

It's worth noting here that from what I gathered of my fellow inmates, the center sees a lot of traffic in the way of court-mandated residency as an alternative to jail. Many of your peers at Shannon West will be individuals convicted of anything up to and including repeated hard drug abuse (the young man I was forced to room with was there on court order after his second conviction related to heroin) or aggravated battery (if I listed all the residents convicted of violent offenses, I might hit the character limit). Despite the overly optimistic tones of their literature, expect violence to be a part of daily life while living there- not a week went by while I stayed that didn't see at least one fight, and at least one of them led to one person being hauled off in an ambulance with stab wounds while the other was taken away in handcuffs.

Upon ""checking in"" you are required to give a full inventory of anything you may own, and submit to a strip search- anything considered not ""conducive"" to your stay at the center will be confiscated and kept in an office which is left unlocked and unsupervised- more than once there were incidents where residents stole each others' things when they left for good. It's safe to assume that anything besides the clothes on your back won't be allowed unless you have a damn good reason for it. You are also forced to agree to a two-week confinement period where you are personally given more intensive ""therapy"" that is intended to force you into admitting some deep personal fault or flaw, to be the focus of your ""rehabilitation"" for the remainder of your stay. Simpy being ""down on your luck"" is seen as a dodge, and will only be met with increasing aggressiveness from the staff to elicit a confession.

After your confinement period is ended, you are allowed to apply for permission to leave the compound, with a reason for doing so, but this is only then allowed if you can get a staff member to sign off, and if they don't think you have a good enough reason then you will be confined to the compound indefinitely. This creates a catch-22, because they also require that you provide proof that you are applying to a certain minimum amount of jobs per week, lest you be tossed back out on the street, but they do not consider online job searches and applications to be valid- only carbon- or photo-copies of physical application forms will suffice. Cross the wrong staffer and you'll be blacklisted from leaving, effectively putting you out on your ass with no recourse- all decisions are final, and going to another staffer for an appeal or review is specifically written in the contract (which you must sign before checking in) as a violation that merits expulsion in and of itself.

Once you manage to get a job, things don't get much better. You are required to submit your work schedule for approval, along with your travel plans to and from, and being more than fifteen minutes tardy back from work will earn you an extra helping of work detail; suffice to say, if you rely on the bus system for transportation then you will be cleaning the dishes and the floors every night after you're done working.

Oh, and if your job is particularly rigid about its schedule, you shouldn't expect to hold on to it for long. Periodically the residents of Shannon West are loaned out as free labor to other HoSN projects, and attendance to such projects is mandatory on threat of expulsion, job or no job. I was forced to take over a week off to help take orders for a HELP initiative to assist low-income families get Christmas presents- a noble endeavor, to be sure, but I don't think it was right that I had to put my job in such jeopardy over it. I believe I was one of only three people who managed to stay employed through that one, out of maybe sixteen or so who had jobs before it started. I can only thank my then-employer for being so understanding about the situation I was in, and sheer dumb luck for the fact that my job itself was yielding enough that I could go a week without working and still have a job.

And one last (huge) thing- you are required to furnish your financial information to them- both existing bank accounts, credit cards, etc. and your paycheck from your job (you're forced to ask for a paper check, which they cash for you). They demand that you sign over control of all your financial assets, and that they control your money for the duration of your stay. The fine print of your contract specifically states that they will return every last penny to you when you leave, but don't believe it. Rather than give them access to my real ONCU account, I signed up for a dummy account with Wells Fargo before checking in and the account records showed that I was substantially shortchanged when I compared it to the ADP records for take-home pay which my employer showed me. Even with that, I had to fight tooth and nail to be allowed access to that account so that I could pay the rent and deposits for the apartment I eventually moved out to. Despite being perfectly capable of handling the financial burden, the staff tried everything they could to stop me from leaving until it was clear that I wouldn't take no for an answer.

All in all, I'm grateful for having had a place to stay that wasn't some dank back-alley, but for the entire time I was there, as well as quite some time afterwards, I regretted the decision to choose Shannon West. I don't know much about other options in the area, but please consider another shelter if it is at all an option for you. You'll thank yourself later.

**TL;DR- If you're a homeless teen in Las Vegas, stay away from Shannon West unless your life literally depends on it**",2014-09-21 02:04:36,2014,9,21,2,4,36

I am conducting this interview to help expose some of my classmates to issues that this population in particular experiences. You will not need to disclose your name or any other identifying information. But I would love to get an in depth background about your history, how you became homeless, some of the lesser known struggles that homelessness involves, and I'd especially like to talk about the stigmatization, stereotyping, and general marginalization that occurs due to the dominant society's beliefs about who homeless people are. If anyone is interested in sharing their story I'd love to be an open and empathetic ear for you. ",2014-04-12 17:40:51,2014,4,12,17,40,51
